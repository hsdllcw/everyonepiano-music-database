### 草原上的家园中英对照歌词

Oh, give me a home where the buffalo roam, where the deer and the antelope
play,

噢，给我一个家，那里有水牛漫步，那里有鹿和羚羊在玩耍，

where seldom is heard a discouraging world and the skies are not cloudy all
day.

那里很少听到令人泄气的话，那里万里无云终日晴朗。  

Home, home on the range, where the deer and the antelope play,

家，草原上的家，那里有鹿和羚羊在玩耍，

where seldom is heard a discouraging world and the skies are not cloudy all
day.

那里很少听到令人泄气的话，那里万里无云终日晴朗。

(Repeat once)
