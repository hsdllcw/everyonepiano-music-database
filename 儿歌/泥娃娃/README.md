### 《泥娃娃》歌词：

泥娃娃泥娃娃 一个泥娃娃  
也有那眉毛 也有那眼睛 眼睛不会眨  
泥娃娃泥娃娃 一个泥娃娃  
也有那鼻子 也有那嘴巴 嘴巴不说话  
她是个假娃娃 不是个真娃娃  
她没有亲爱的妈妈 也没有爸爸  
泥娃娃泥娃娃 一个泥娃娃  
我做她妈妈 我做她爸爸 永远爱着她

  
英文歌词  

The doll of clay.  
The doll of clay.  
She's a doll of clay.  
She has got eyebrows.  
She has got blue eyes.  
Which cannot wink.  
The doll of clay.  
The doll of clay.  
She's a doll of clay.  
She has got a nose.  
She has got a mouth.  
Which cannot speak.  
She's but a doll of clay.  
She's not a living doll.  
She has got no loving Papa,  
no loving Mama.  
The doll of clay.  
The doll of clay.  
She's a doll of clay.  
I'll be her Papa.  
I'll be her Mama.  
For every loving day.
