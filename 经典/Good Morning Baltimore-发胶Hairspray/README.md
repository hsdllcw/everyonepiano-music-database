Good Morning Baltimore歌词：

  

Oh, oh, oh woke up today feeling  
the way I always do  
Oh, oh, oh hungry for something that I can't eat  
Then I hear that beat  
The rhythm of town starts calling me down  
It's like a message from high above  
Oh, oh, oh pulling me out to the smiles and the  
Streets that I love  
Good morning Baltimore  
Every day's like an open door  
Every night is a fantasy  
Every sound's like a symphony  
Good morning Baltimore  
And some day when I take to the floor  
The world's gonna wake up and see  
Baltimore and me  
Oh, oh, oh look at my hair  
What do can compare with mine today?  
Oh, oh, oh I've got my hairspray and radio  
I'm ready to go  
The rats on the street all dance round my feet  
They seem to say, "Tracy, it's up to you  
So, oh, oh don't hold me back  
'Cause today all my dreams will come true  
Good morning Baltimore  
There's the flasher who lives next door  
There's the bum on his bar room stool  
They wish me luck on my way to school  
Good morning Baltimore  
And some day when I take to the floor  
The world's gonna wake up and see  
Baltimore and me  
I know every step, I know every song  
I know there's a place where I belong  
I see all those party lights shining ahead  
So someone invite me before I drop dead  
So, oh, oh give me a chance  
'Cause when I start to dance I'm a movie star  
Oh, oh, oh something inside of me makes me move  
When I hear the groove  
My mom tells me no but my feet tell me go  
It's like a drummer inside my heart  
So, oh, oh don't make me wait  
One more moment for my life to start  
I love you Baltimore  
Every day's like an open door  
Every night is a fantasy  
Every sound's like a symphony  
And I promise Baltimore  
That some day when I take to the floor  
The world's gonna wake up and see  
Gonna wake up and see Baltimore and me  
(Yes, more or less we all agree)  
Baltimore and me!  
(Someday the world is gonna see)  
Baltimore and me!
