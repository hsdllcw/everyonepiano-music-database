**Nothing's Gonna Change My Love for You**
是经典爱情片《廊桥遗梦》主题曲。这首歌演唱版本众多（Westlife、杜德伟等等）。原唱是黑人爵士乐手George
Benson，令人遗憾的是，在他唱的时候没有走红（而多年以后经过其他歌手多次的翻唱而风靡全球）。那略带沙哑，又充满悲伤的声音，感动着每一位用心聆听人。目前全球范围内流传度最广泛的版本是西城男孩版。

### Nothing's Gonna Change My Love for You歌词：

If I had to live my life without you near me  
The days would all be empty  
The nights would seem so long  
With you I see forever oh so clearly  
I might have been in love before  
But it never felt this strong  
Our dreams are young And we both know  
they'll take us where we want to go  
Hold me now  
Touch me now  
I don't want to live without you  
Nothing's gonna change my love for you  
You oughta know by now how much I love you  
One thing you can be sure of  
I'll never ask for more than your love  
Nothing's gonna change my love for you  
You oughta know by now how much I love you  
The world may change my whole life through  
But nothing's gonna change my love for you  
If the road ahead is not so easy,  
Our love will lead the way for us  
Just like a guiding star  
I'll be there for you if you should need me  
You don't have to change a thing  
I love you just the way you are  
So come with me and share the view  
I'll help you see forever too  
Hold me now  
Touch me now  
I don't want to live without you  
Nothing's gonna change my love for you  
You oughta know by now how much I love you  
One thing you can be sure of  
I'll never ask for more than your love  
Nothing's gonna change my love for you  
You oughta know by now how much I love you  
The world may change my whole life through  
But nothing's gonna change my love for you  
Nothing's gonna change my love for you  
You oughta know by now how much I love you  
One thing you can be sure of  
I'll never ask for more than your love  
Nothing's gonna change my love for you  
You oughta know by now how much I love you  
The world may change my whole life through  
But nothing's gonna change my love for you
