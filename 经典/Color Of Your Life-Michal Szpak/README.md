### Color of Your Life歌词：

When loneliness is knocking on your door  
Everything you loved just disappears  
And when you feel that everything is lost  
You need to know  
There's no life without tears  
Oh oh oh oh  
Tell me black or white  
What color is your life  
Oh oh oh oh  
Try to ask your heart  
Who you really are  
No one is forever beautiful and young  
Everything you know just disappears  
Fame and gold are nothing you can be sure  
When there is no love in your heart  
The choice is yours who you really want to be  
Don't be afraid of your destiny  
So when you feel that everything is lost  
You need to know there's no life without fear  
Oh oh oh oh  
Tell me black or white  
What color is your life  
Oh oh oh oh  
Try to ask your heart  
Who you really are  
Every day we must fight with the wind  
We have to live  
All these things are just empty desire  
'Cause there's no smoke without fire  
Oh oh oh oh  
Tell me black or white  
What color is your life  
Oh oh oh oh  
Try to ask your heart  
Who you really are  
Oh oh oh oh  
Try to ask your heart  
What color is your life
