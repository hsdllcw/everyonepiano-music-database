### The Last Waltz歌词：

I wonder should I go or should I stay ?  
The band had only one more song to play .  
And then I saw you out the corner of eye ,  
a little girl alone and so shy .  
I had the last waltz with you ,  
two lonely people together .  
I fell in love with you .  
The last waltz should last forever .  
But the love we had was going strong .  
Through the good and bad ,we got along .  
And then the flame of love died in your eyes .  
My heart was broken in two when you said goodbye .  
I had the last waltz with you ,  
two lonely people together .  
I fell in love with you .  
The last waltz should last forever .  
It's all over now ,nothing left to say ,  
just my tears and the orchestra playing .  
la la la … la la la …  
I had the last waltz with you .  
two lonely people together .  
I fell in love with you .  
The last waltz should last forever .  
la la la …
