**The First Noel**
，中文《第一个圣诞》，又称《圣诞佳音》，是一支传统英格兰圣诞颂歌，大约出自18世纪，但也可能更早。Noel一词来自法语Noël（即圣诞节），而这个法语词则来自拉丁语natalis（即生日）。

现在流行的版本起源自康沃尔郡，最早出现于《古今颂歌集》（《Carols Ancient and
Modern》，1823）和吉尔伯特与山迪颂歌集（《Gilbert and Sandys
Carols》，1833）中，这两个集子的作者都是威廉•山迪，并由大卫•吉尔伯特编辑。现在的版本由英国作曲家约翰•斯坦纳编辑，分成四个部分收录于其《新旧颂歌集》（《Carols,
New and Old》，1871）中。此外第一个圣诞的乐谱也有许多变体。

### The First Noel歌词：

CHORUS:  
The first Noel the Angels did say  
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay  
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep  
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.  
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Born is the King of Israel  
VERSE1:  
They looked up and saw a star  
Shining in the east, beyond them far  
And to the earth it gave great light  
And so it continued both day and night  
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Born is the King of Israel  
(The following 4 verses are not sung on the Boney M version)  
And by the light of that same star  
Three wise men came from country far;  
To seek for a king was their intent,  
And to follow the star wherever it went.  
(CHORUS)  
This star drew nigh to the northwest,  
O'er Bethlehem it took it rest,  
And there it did both stop and stay  
Right over the place where Jesus lay.  
(CHORUS)  
Then entered in those wise men three  
Full reverently upon their knee,  
and offered there in his presence  
Their gold, and myrrh, and frakincense.  
(CHORUS)  
Then let us all with one accord  
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord;  
That hath made heaven and earth of naught,  
And with his blood mankind hath bought.  
(CHORUS)  
The first Noel the Angels did say  
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay  
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep  
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.  
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Born is the King of Israel
