### 圣诞歌曲Merry Christmas Darling歌词：

Greeting cards have all been sent

The Christmas rush is through

But I still have one wish to make

A special one for you

Merry Christmas, darling

We're apart, that's true

But I can dream

And in my dreams

I'm Christmasing with you

Holidays are joyful

There's always something new

But every day's a holiday

When I'm near to you

The lights on my tree

I wish you could see

I wish it every day

The logs on the fire

Fill me with desire

To see you and to say

That I wish you Merry Christmas

Happy New Year too

I've just one wish

On this Christmas Eve

I wish I were with you

The logs on the fire

Fill me with desire

To see you and to say

That I wish you Merry Christmas

Happy New Year too

I've just one wish

On this Christmas Eve

I wish I were with you

I wish I were with you

Merry Christmas, darling
