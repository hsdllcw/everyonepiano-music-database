### Bored to Death歌词：

There's an echo pulling out the meaning  
Rescuing a nightmare from a dream  
The voices in my head are always screaming  
That none of this means anything to me

And it's a long way back from seventeen  
The whispers turn into a scream  
And I, I'm not coming home

Save your breath, I'm nearly  
Bored to death and fading fast  
Life is too short to last long  
Back on Earth, I'm broken  
Lost and cold and fading fast  
Life is too short to last long

There's a stranger staring at the ceiling  
Rescuing a tiger from a tree  
The pictures in her head are always dreaming  
Each of them means everything to me

And it's a long way back from seventeen  
The whispers turn into a scream  
And I, I'm not coming home

Save your breath, I'm nearly  
Bored to death and fading fast  
Life is too short to last long  
Back on Earth, I'm broken  
Lost and cold and fading fast  
Life is too short to last long

Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh  
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

(Oh oh, oh oh)  
I think I met her at the minute that the rhythm was set down  
(Oh oh, oh oh)  
I said I'm sorry I'm a bit of a letdown  
(Oh oh, oh oh)  
But all my friends are daring me to come over  
(Oh oh, oh oh)  
So I come over and over and over  
(Oh oh, oh oh)  
So let me buy you a drink and we'll pretend that you think  
(Oh oh, oh oh)  
That I'm the man of your dreams come to life in a dive bar  
(Oh oh, oh oh)  
And we'll go over and over and over  
(Oh oh, oh oh)  
And we'll go over and over and over  
(Oh oh, oh oh)  
And we'll go over and over and over  
(Oh oh, oh oh)  
And we'll go over and over and over

Save your breath, I'm nearly  
Bored to death and fading fast  
Life is too short to last long  
Back on Earth, I'm broken  
Lost and cold and fading fast  
Life is too short to last long

Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh  
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh  
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh  
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh  
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh  
(Life is too short to last long)  
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh  
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh  
Oh oh
