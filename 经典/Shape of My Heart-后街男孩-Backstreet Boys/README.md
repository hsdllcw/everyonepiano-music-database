###  Shape of My Heart（我的心意）-后街男孩Backstreet Boys中文歌词：

请原谅我

留下来，不要放弃你的热情

抱着我，不必烦恼

如果我渐渐弱去

（惟有）你可以将我拯救

回望我过去的种种

从前我想要改变自己

我自导自演，没让你看见真实的我

但现在我要向你表明我的心意

哀伤显得优美，孤独有如一出悲剧

拯救我吧，这场战争我不可能胜利

贴近我，不必烦恼

如果我渐渐弱去

（惟有）你可以将我拯救

我就在这里坦白

再也不作任何隐瞒了

不知道如何开口

只好直接向你表明我的心意

我回望过去的种种

我不想继续作秀

不想继续对你隐瞒

现在让我向你表明我的心意

（重唱）

###  Shape of My Heart（我的心意）-后街男孩Backstreet Boys英文歌词：

Hmm, yeah, yeah

Baby, please try to forgive me

Stay here don't put out the glow

Hold me now don't bother

If every minute it makes me weaker

You can save me from the man that I've become

Oh yeah

Lookin' back on the things I've done

I was tryin' to be someone

I played my part, kept you in the dark

Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Sadness is beautiful and loneliness is tragical

So help me I can't win this war

Oh no

Touch me now don't bother

If every second it makes me weaker

You can save me from the man that I've become

Lookin' back on the things I've done

I was tryin' to be someone

I played my part, kept you in the dark

Now let me show you the shape of my heart

I'm here with my confession

Got nothing to hide no more

I don't know where to start

But to show you the shape of my heart

I'm lookin' back on things I've done

I never wanna play the same old part

Or keep you in the dark

Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Lookin' back on the things I've done

I was tryin' to be someone

I played my part, kept you in the dark

Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Lookin' back on the things I've done

I was tryin' to be someone

I played my part, kept you in the dark

Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Show you the shape of my heart
