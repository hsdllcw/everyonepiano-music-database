### Hark! the Herald Angels Sing英文歌词：

Hark the herald angels sing ,

"Glory to the new born King"

Peace on earth and mercy mild ,

God an sinners reconciled

Joyful all ye nations rise.

Join the triumph of the skies

With angelic host proclaim

"Christ is born in Bethlehem"

Hark the herald angels sing

"Glory to the new born King"

Christ, by highest heaven adored;

Christ the everlasting Lord;

Late in time behold him come,

Offspring of the favored one.

Veiled in flesh, the Godhead see;

hail the incarnate Diety

Pleased as man with men to dwell,

Jesus, our Immanuel

Hark the herald angels sing,

"Glory to the new born King"

ah...ha...

ha...

Hail! the heaven-born Prince of Peace.

Hail the son of Righteousness

Light and life to all He brings,

risen with healing in His wings

Mild He lays His glory by,

born that man no more may die

Born to raise the sons of earth,

born to give them second birth

Hark the herald angels sing

"Glory to the new born King"
