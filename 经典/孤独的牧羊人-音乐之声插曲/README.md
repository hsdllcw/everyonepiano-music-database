**孤独的牧羊人** 是音乐剧或电影《the sound of
music》《音乐之声》的插曲。玛利亚带领孩子们为男爵夫人表演木偶剧，他们的表演和歌曲都十分幽默而风趣。

《音乐之声》（The Sound of Music），是一部改编自Maria von Trapp的著作《崔普家庭演唱团》（The Story of the
Trapp Family Singers）的戏剧作品，最初以音乐剧的形式于百老汇上演，之后被改编成电影，位居北美影史票房第三名，同时也是史上最卖座的歌舞片。

### 孤独的牧羊人歌词：

MARIA (sings)

High on a hill was a lonely goatherd

Lay ee odl lay ee odl lay hee hoo

Loud was the voice of the lonely goatherd

Lay ee odl lay ee odl-oo

Folks in a town that was quite remote heard

Lay ee odl lay ee odl lay hee hoo

Lusty and clear from the goatherd's throat heard

Lay ee odl lay ee odl-oo

Above the stage, the children work the puppet strings. On stage, goats dance
alongside the shepherd.

CHILDREN (singing)

O ho lay dee odl lee o, o ho lay dee odl ay

O ho lay dee odl lee o, lay dee odl lee o lay

MARIA (whispers) Marta! Marta!

Marta unrolls a new backdrop: a castle.

MARIA (whispers) Gretl! The prince!

Gretl shoves a prince puppet onstage.

MARIA (sings)

A prince on the bridge of a castle moat heard

Lay ee odl lay ee odl lay hee hoo

Two bearded male puppets with backpacks walk on.

THE BOYS (singing)

Men on a road with a load to tote heard

Lay ee odl lay ee odl-oo

A curtain rises to show: A beer hall. A puppet carrying many mugs of beer to
two men sitting at a table with forks and knives at the ready. Marionette
musicians play while marionette customers drink mugs of marionette beer.

THE CHILDREN (singing)

Men in the midst of a table d'hote heard

Lay ee odl lay ee odl lay hee hoo

MARIA (sings)

Men drinking beer with the foam afloat heard

Lay ee odl lay ee odl-oo

Marta blows the foam from a beer and splashes Maria who coughs. A girl puppet
with blonde braids appears to join the shepherd.

MARIA (sings)

One little girl in a pale pink coat heard

Lay ee odl lay ee odl lay hee hoo

BRIGITTA (sings)

She yodeled back to the lonely goatherd

Lay ee odl lay ee odl-oo

The blonde girl's bosomy mother appears and pushes the girl to the shepherd.

MARIA (sings)

Soon her Mama with a gleaming gloat heard

Lay ee odl lay ee odl lay hee hoo

What a duet for a girl and goatherd

MARIA AND THE CHILDREN (singing)

Lay ee odl lay ee odl-oo

Mother and daughter dance with the shepherd. Three couples dance the polka as
the band continues to play. Above them, Maria and the children manipulate the
puppets with all the consummate skill of professional puppeteers like, oh, for
example, Bill and Cora Baird. Max, the Baroness, and the Captain laugh with
delight.

MARIA AND THE CHILDREN (singing)

Ummm (ummm) ...

Odl lay ee (odl lay ee)

Odl lay hee hee (odl lay hee hee)

Odl lay ee ...

Maria breaks out into a serious case of yodeling. She sighs, wipes her brow,
and signals to Marta for the next backdrop. Onstage, a boy and girl goat
replace the shepherd and his girlfriend.

BRIGITTA (sings)

One little girl in a pale pink coat heard

MARIA (sings)

Lay ee odl lay ee odl lay hoo hoo

BRIGITTA (sings)

She yodeled back to the lonely goatherd

LIESL (sings)

Lay ee odl lay ee odl-oo

The girl goat's mother appears and bucks her daughter into the boy goat.

MARIA (sings)

Soon her Mama with a gleaming gloat heard

Lay ee odl lay ee odl lay hmm hmm

What a duet for a girl and goatherd

Lay ee odl lay ee odl-oo

The two goats snuggle and that's all it takes for a baby goat to appear and
dance with them. Apparently, the Austrian mountain goat is equipped with some
very advanced biological mechanisms.

MARIA AND THE CHILDREN (singing)

Happy are they lay dee olay dee lee o ...

Lay ee odl lay ee odl lay hee hoo

Soon the duet will become a trio

MARIA (sings)

Lay ee odl lay ee odl-oo

MARIA AND THE CHILDREN (singing)

Odl lay ee, odl lay ee (odl lay ee)

Odl lay hee hee (odl lay hee hee),

Odl lay ee (odl lay ee)

Odl lay odl lay (odl lay odl lay),

Odl lay odl lee (odl lay odl lee)

Odl lay odl lee (odl lay odl lee)

Odl lay odl lay odl lay

THE CHILDREN

Whoo!
