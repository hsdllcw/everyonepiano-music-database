《 **红鼻子驯鹿鲁道夫** 》（Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer）是一首著名的圣诞歌曲，讲的是驯鹿鲁道夫的故事。

从前有一只驯鹿名叫鲁道夫，它是这个世界上唯一长着大红鼻子的驯鹿。人们很自然地叫它红鼻子驯鹿鲁道夫。鲁道夫为自己的鼻子感到难堪。后来有一年，鲁道夫靠他的红鼻子救了圣诞节，从那以后，鲁道夫成了最有名的驯鹿，受到所有人的喜爱。他从前恨不得藏起来的羞耻的红鼻子，如今让每一只驯鹿羡慕不已。

### 红鼻子驯鹿鲁道夫歌词：

Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer  
Had a very shiny nose  
And if you ever saw it  
You would even say it glows  
All of the other reindeer  
They used to laugh and call him names  
They never let poor Rudolph  
Join in any reindeer games  
Then one foggy Christmas eve  
Santa came to say:  
Babyface  
"Rudolph with your nose so bright  
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"  
Then all the reindeer loved him  
As they shouted out with glee  
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer  
You'll go down in history  
Hey Rudolph, guide my sleigh  
Hey Rudolph, guide my sleigh  
Hey Rudolph, guide my sleigh  
Hey Rudolph  
Then one foggy Christmas eve  
Santa came to say:  
"Rudolph with your nose so bright  
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"  
Then how the reindeer loved him  
As they shouted out with glee  
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer  
You'll go down in history  
Hey Rudolph, guide my sleigh  
Hey Rudolph, guide my sleigh  
Hey Rudolph, guide my sleigh  
Hey Rudolph  
Hey Rudolph, guide my sleigh  
Hey Rudolph, guide my sleigh  
Hey Rudolph, guide my sleigh
