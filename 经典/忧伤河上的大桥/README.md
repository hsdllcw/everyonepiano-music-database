听《忧伤河上的大桥》时,很得意地想:一条忧伤河上的大桥,来来往往的人,那么多,还有谁会象我这样,在日渐西薄的时候,最终成了个彻头彻尾的伊壁鸠鲁的门徒。

忧伤河上的大桥-一首经典的英文老歌。

### 忧伤河上的大桥英文歌词：

When you are weary, feeling small;  
When tears are in your eyes, I will dry them all.  
I'm on your side. Oh, when time gets rough,  
and friends just can't be found.  
Like a bridge over troubled water, I will lay me down.

When you down and out, when you on the treet.  
When evening falls so hard, I will comfort you.  
I'll take your part. Oh, When darkness comes.  
And pain is all around  
Like a bridge over troubled water, I will lay me down.

Sail on silver girl, sail on by,  
Your time has come to shine.  
All your dreams are on their way, see how they shine.  
Oh, when you need a friend, I'm sailing right behind.  
Like a bridge over troubled water, I will ease your mind

Like a Bridge over troubled WATER,  
I will ease your mind.
