### 圣诞歌-经典圣诞歌曲歌词：

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire

Jack Frost nipping at your nose

Yuletide carols being sung by a choir

And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe

Help to make the season bright

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow

Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way

He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh

And every mother's child is gonna spy

To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase

To kids from one to ninety two

Although its been said many times, many ways

Merry Christmas to you

And so I'm offering this simple phrase

To kids from one to ninety two

Although its been said many times, many ways

Merry Christmas to you
