### On My Own歌词：

And now I'm all alone again  
Nowhere to turn, no one to go to  
Without a home without a friend  
Without a face to say hello to  
And now the night is near  
I can make believe he's here  
Sometimes I walk alone at night  
When everybody else is sleeping  
I think of him and I'm happy  
With the company I'm keeping  
The city goes to bed  
And I can live inside my head  
Own my own  
Pretending he's beside me  
All alone  
I walk with him till morning  
Without him  
I feel his arms around me  
And when I lose my way I close my eyes  
And he has found me  
In the rain the pavement shines like silver  
All the lights are misty in the river  
In the darkness, the trees are full of starlight  
And all I see is him and me forever and forever  
And I know it's only in my mind  
That I'm talking to myself and not to him  
And although I know that he is blind  
Still I say, there's a way for us  
I love him  
But when the night is over  
He is gone  
The river's just a river  
Without him  
The world around me changes  
The trees are bare and everywhere  
The streets are full of strangers  
I love him  
But every day I'm learning  
All my life  
I've only been pretending  
Without me  
His world would go on turning  
A world that's full of happiness  
That I have never known  
I love him  
I love him  
I love him  
But only on my own.  
  
Own my own  
形单影只  
Pretending he's beside me  
自欺他就在身旁  
All alone  
孑然一人  
I walk with him till morning  
随其漫步到黎明  
Without him  
没有他  
I feel his arms around me  
仍能感觉拥抱的温度  
And when I lose my way I close my eyes  
当我迷途，只需阖眼  
And he has found me  
他便能找到我的身影  
In the rain the pavement shines like silver  
雨中，路面闪耀如银  
All the lights are misty in the river  
水面，华灯亦真亦幻  
In the darkness, the trees are full of starlight  
夜里，火树缀满银花  
And all I see is him and me forever and forever  
而我，心在与他终老  
And I know it's only in my mind  
心知肚明，只是一厢情愿  
That I'm talking to myself and not to him  
自言自语，而非与其倾谈  
And although I know that he is blind  
虽然自知，我不在他眼中  
Still I say, there's a way for us  
仍然自欺，我们还未缘尽  
I love him  
我爱他  
But when the night is over  
但，每当夜晚蹑足而去  
He is gone  
他亦离开  
The river's just a river  
河水，还是河水  
Without him  
没有他  
The world around me changes  
世界面目全非  
The trees are bare and everywhere  
绿叶凋尽  
The streets are full of strangers  
街上只剩陌生人  
I love him  
我爱他  
But every day I'm learning  
但每日，我都更清晰地意识到  
All my life  
我的生命  
I've only been pretending  
一直在自欺欺人  
Without me  
没有我  
His world would go on turning  
他的世界仍运转如常  
A world that's full of happiness  
那块充满幸福的梦土  
That I have never known  
我永远无法步入  
I love him  
我爱他  
I love him  
我爱他  
I love him  
我爱他  
But only on my own.  
但只是一厢情愿
