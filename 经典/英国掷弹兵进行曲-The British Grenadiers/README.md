_英国掷弹兵进行曲_ ，英文The British Grenadiers，是英国最著名也是历史最为悠久的步兵行军曲，其历史可以追溯到17世纪，原作者不明。

有人说起源于17世纪的歌曲“THE NEW
BATH”（新浴池），但还有人说起源于另一首《弗里斯兰的年轻王子》。拿破仑时代是很流行的军歌，现在是白金汉宫前换岗仪式的必奏曲。

### 英国掷弹兵进行曲歌词：

Some talk of Alexander, and some of Hercules  
Of Hector and Lysander, and such great names as these.  
But of all the world's great heroes, there's none that can compare.  
With a tow, row, row, row, row, row, to the British Grenadiers.  
Those heroes of antiquity ne'er saw a cannon ball,  
Or knew the force of powder to slay their foes withal.  
But our brave boys do know it, and banish all their fears,  
Sing tow, row, row, row, row, row, for the British Grenadiers.  
Whene'er we are commanded to storm the palisades,  
Our leaders march with fusees, and we with hand grenades.  
We throw them from the glacis, about the enemies' ears.  
Sing tow, row, row, row, row, row, the British Grenadiers.  
And when the siege is over, we to the town repair.  
The townsmen cry, "Hurrah, boys, here comes a Grenadier!  
Here come the Grenadiers, my boys, who know no doubts or fears!  
Then sing tow, row, row, row, row, row, the British Grenadiers.  
Then let us fill a bumper, and drink a health to those  
Who carry caps and pouches, and wear the loupèd clothes.  
May they and their commanders live happy all their years.  
With a tow, row, row, row, row, row, for the British Grenadiers.
