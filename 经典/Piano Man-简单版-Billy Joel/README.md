### Piano Man歌词：

It's nine o'clock on a Saturday  
The regular crowd shuffles in  
There's an old man sitting next to me  
Makin' love to his tonic and gin  
He says, "Son, can you play me a melody?  
I'm not really sure how it goes  
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete  
When I wore a younger man's clothes"  
La la la, de de da  
La la, de de da da da  
Sing us a song, you're the piano man  
Sing us a song, you're the piano man  
Sing us a song, you're the piano man  
Sing us a song tonight  
Sing us a song tonight  
Sing us a song tonight  
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody  
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody  
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody  
And you've got us feelin' alright  
And you've got us feelin' alright  
And you've got us feelin' alright  
Now John at the bar is a friend of mine  
He gets me my drinks for free  
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke  
But there's someplace that he'd rather be  
He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me."  
As the smile ran away from his face  
"Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star  
If I could get out of this place"  
Oh, la la la, de de da  
La la, de de da da da  
Now Paul is a real estate novelist  
Who never had time for a wife  
And he's talkin' with Davy who's still in the navy  
And probably will be for life  
And the waitress is practicing politics  
As the businessmen slowly get stoned  
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness  
But it's better than drinkin' alone  
It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday  
And the manager gives me a smile  
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see  
To forget about life for a while  
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival  
And the microphone smells like a beer  
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar  
And say, "Man, what are you doin' here?"  
Oh, la la la, de de da  
La la, de de da da da
