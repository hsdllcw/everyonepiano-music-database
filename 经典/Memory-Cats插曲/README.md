### Memory歌词：

Midnight  
Not a sound from the pavement  
Has the moon lost her memory  
She is smiling alone  
In the lamplight  
The withered leaves collect at my feet  
And the wind begins to moan  
Memory, all alone in the moonlight  
I can dream of the old days  
Life was beautiful then  
I remember the time I knew what happiness was  
Let the memory live again  
Every street lamp seems to beat  
A fatalistic warning  
Someone mutters and the street lamp sputters  
Soon it will be morning  
Daylight  
I must wait for the sunrise  
I must think of a new life and  
I mustn't give in  
When the dawn comes  
Tonight will be a memory too  
And a new day will begin  
Burnt out ends of smoky days  
The stale court smell of morning  
A street lamp dies  
Another night is over  
Another day is dawning  
Touch me,  
It is so easy to leave me  
All alone with the memory  
Of my days in the sun  
If you'll touch me,  
You'll understand what happiness is  
Look, a new day has begun...
