### 小镇伯利恒（O Little Town of Bethlehem)英文歌词：

Christmas Music

Oh, Little Town of Bethlehem

How still we see thee lie;

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep

The silent stars go by;

Yet in thy dark streets shineth

The everlasting light.

The hopes and fears of all the years

Are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary,

And gathered all above,

While mortals sleep the angels keep

Their watch of wondering love.

O morning stars, together

Proclaim the holy birth !

And praises sing to God the King,

And peace to men on earth !

How silently, how silently

The wondrous gift is given !

So God imparts to human hearts

The blessings of His heaven.

No ear may hear His coming;

But in this world of sin,

Where meek souls will receive Him still,

The dear Christ enters in.

O holy Child of Bethlehem,

Descend to us, we pray;

Cast out our sin and enter in,

Be born in us today.

We hear the Christmas angels

The great glad tidings tell,

O come to us, abide with us,

Out Lord Emmanuel !

O come to us, abide with us,
