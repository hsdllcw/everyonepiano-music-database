### 巨石糖果山中文歌词：

在那天傍晚日落的时候

如同野火在林中蔓延

沿着那小路走来一位旅行者  
他说,男孩们, 我决不会回头

我一定要到那远方的国度

或许就在水晶泉的旁边

所以跟我远走高飞吧, 我们终将到达

那巨石糖果山  

在巨石糖果山里

有个公正明亮的国度

灌木从中生长着必需品

你可日日在外露宿

在那里箱车都是空的

每一天都那么晴朗

鸟儿和蜜蜂在烟草树周围徘徊

蓝鸟在柠檬水的喷泉中放歌

在巨石糖果山里

警察的腿都是木桩子

公狗的牙都是橡胶的

母鸡们生的是荷包蛋

果农的树上果实遍布

干草也会堆满了马厩

Oh, 我一定要去那个没有冰雪的地方

雨水不会冲击

狂风不会怒吼

在巨石糖果山里

你可以不换袜子

还有淌着酒的河流

如果从岩石上滑下来

修补匠们就的去补他们的帽子

会有挡在铁轨上的瞎公牛

威士忌和炖肉的小湖

你可以把它们都搬到船上

在巨石糖果山里

监狱是用罐头围成

即使你被关进去

也可以马上再出来

这里没有短柄铲子

没有斧子, 锯子或是镐

你我可终日呼呼大睡

蠢人才会去工作

在巨石糖果山里

我将看到你们全都会堕落  

  

### 巨石糖果山英文歌词：

Big Rock Candy Mountain

One evening as the sun went down and the jungle fire was burning  
Down the track came a hobo hiking and he said boys I'm not turning  
I'm headin for a land that's far away beside the crystal fountains  
So come with me we'll go and see the Big Rock Candy Mountains

In the Big Rock Candy Mountains there's a land that's fair and bright  
Where the handouts grow on bushes and you sleep out every night  
Where the boxcars are all empty and the sun shines every day  
On the birds and the bees and the cigarette trees  
Where the lemonade springs where the bluebird sings  
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains

In the Big Rock Candy Mountains all the cops have wooden legs  
And the bulldogs all have rubber teeth and the hens lay soft boiled eggs  
The farmer's trees are full of fruit and the barns are full of hay  
Oh, I'm bound to go where there ain't no snow  
Where the rain don't fall and the wind don't blow  
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains

In the Big Rock Candy Mountains you never change your socks  
And the little streams of alcohol come a-trickling down the rocks  
The brakemen have to tip their hats and the railroad bulls are blind  
There's a lake of stew and of whiskey too  
You can paddle all around 'em in a big canoe  
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains

In the Big Rock Candy Mountains the jails are made of tin  
And you can walk right out again as soon as you are in  
There ain't no short handled shovels, no axes saws or picks  
I'm a goin to stay where you sleep all day  
Where they hung the jerk that invented work  
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains

I'll see you all this coming fall in the Big Rock Candy Mountains
