“伦敦德里小调”(Londonderry Air或 Derry
Air)是一首优美而动听的乐曲。它是一首爱尔兰民歌，源于北爱尔兰的伦敦德里。这首歌曲同时还是英国北爱尔兰地区的非官方区歌。
这首歌曲又名《伦敦德里之歌》、《丹尼男孩 》（Danny Boy）；是根据流传在伦敦德里（爱尔兰岛北部的一个小城）一首古老民歌《向库库列英告别》改编而成的。

歌曲是有着悠久历史的爱尔兰民谣，曲子流传至今也有三四百年的历史，以前只有曲调而没有歌词。后来以《敦伦德里小调》为曲谱的歌词相继出现，至今有很多种版本。但是以1910年英国律师诗人Frederick
Edward Weatherly写的一首诗，名为《丹尼男孩》（Danny Boy）深受当时人们的喜爱而流传至今。同时演唱者选择以DANNY
BOY歌词唱的人也比较多。

### 《伦敦德里小调》歌词：

Would God I were the tender apple blossom  
That floats and falls from off the twisted bough  
To lie and faint within your silken bosom  
Within your silken bosom as that does now  
Or would I were a little burnish'd apple  
For you to pluck me, gliding by so cold  
While sun and shade you robe of lawn will dapple  
Your robe of lawn, and you hair's spun gold  
Yea, would to God I were among the roses  
That lean to kiss you as you float between  
While on the lowest branch a bud uncloses  
A bud uncloses, to touch you, queen  
Nay, since you will not love, would I were growing  
A happy daisy, in the garden path  
That so your silver foot might press me going  
Might press me going even unto death

  
哦但愿我是娇柔的苹果花  
从弯曲的树枝上面落下  
飘落在你那温柔的胸怀  
我把它当作我的家我长住下  
哦但愿我是光亮的苹果  
在树上等你将我摘下  
树荫下阳光在你的身上描画  
也照亮你的金色头发  
哦我愿长在玫瑰丛林  
跟你走过我能够吻你  
我成为最低枝条上的蓓蕾  
就能轻轻触摸最美的你  
哦既然我的爱情没有希望  
我愿做雏菊开在小路上  
你漫步荒原踩在我的身上  
我就在你的脚下死亡

### 《丹尼男孩 》（Danny Boy）歌词：

Oh Danny Boy  
The pipes, the pipes are calling  
From Glenn to Glenn  
And down the mountain side  
The summer's gone  
And all the flowers are dying  
'Tis you, 'tis you must go  
And I must bide  
But come ye back  
When summer's in the meadow  
Or when the valley's hushed  
And white with snow  
'Tis I'll be here  
In Sunshine or in Shadow  
Oh Danny Boy, oh Danny Boy  
I love you so  
But when ye come  
And all the roses falling  
And I am dead  
As dead I well may be  
Go out and find  
The place where I am lying  
And kneel and say an "Ave" there for me  
And I will hear  
The soft you tread above me  
And then my grave  
Will warm and sweeter be  
For you shall bend and tell me  
That you love me  
And I will sleep in peace  
Until you come to me
