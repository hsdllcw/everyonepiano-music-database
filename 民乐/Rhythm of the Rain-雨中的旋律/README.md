### Rhythm Of The Rain歌词：

Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain,  
Telling me just what a fool I've been.  
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain,  
And let me be alone again.  
The only girl I care about has gone away.  
Looking for a brand new start  
But little does she know that when she left that day.  
Along with her she took my heart.  
Rain, please tell me, now does that seem fair  
For her to steal my heart away when she don't care  
I can't love another, when my heart's somewhere far away.  
The only girl I've care about has gone away.  
Looking for a brand new start  
But little does she know that when she left that day.  
Along with her she took my heart.  
Rain, won't you tell her that I love her so  
Please ask the sun to set her heart aglow  
Rain in her heart and let the love we knew start to grow.  
Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain,  
Telling me just what a fool I've been.  
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain,  
And let me be alone again.  
Ooh listen to the falling rain
