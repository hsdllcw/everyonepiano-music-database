### Donna Donna歌词：

On a wagon bound for market  
There's a calf with a mournful eye  
High above him there' a swallow  
Winging swiftly through the sky  
How the winds are laughing  
They laugh with all their might  
Laugh and laugh  
The whole day through  
And half the summer's night  
Donna Donna Donna Donna  
Donna Donna Donna Do  
Donna Donna Donna Donna  
Donna Donna Donna Do  
Stop complaning said the farmer  
Who told you a calf to be  
Why don't you have winging to fly with  
Like the swallow so proud and free  
How the winds are laughing  
They laugh with all there might  
Laugh and laugh  
The whole day through  
And half the summer's night  
Donna Donna Donna Donna  
Donna Donna Donna Do  
Donna Donna Donna Donna  
Donna Donna Donna Do  
Calves are easily bound  
And slaughtered  
Never knowing the reason why  
But whoever treasures freedom  
Like a swallow has learned to fly  
How the winds are laughing  
They laugh with all there might  
Laugh and laugh  
The whole day through  
And half the summer's night  
Donna Donna Donna Donna  
Donna Donna Donna Do  
Donna Donna Donna Donna  
Donna Donna Donna Do
