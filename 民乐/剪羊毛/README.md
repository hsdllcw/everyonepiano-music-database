这是一首澳大利亚流传颇广的民歌。澳大利亚以生产羊毛而著称，这首《剪羊毛》描写了澳大利亚牧场工人紧张的劳动生活和乐观的精神面貌。歌曲中用了很多美丽的形象生动的词来表现歌曲，比如说“白云、冬雪、丝棉”来比喻羊毛，把绵羊身上厚厚的比喻成皮袄，非常有意思。  
  

### 剪羊毛中文版歌词：

  
河那边草原呈现白色一片，  
好像是白云从天空飘临，  
你看那周围雪堆象冬天，  
这里我们在剪羊毛，剪羊毛，  
洁白的羊毛象丝绵,  
锋利的剪子咔嚓响，  
只要我们大家努力来劳动，  
幸福生活一定来到，一定来到。

绵羊你别发抖呀你别害怕，  
不要担心你的旧皮袄，  
炎热的夏天你用不到它，  
秋天你又穿上新皮袄,新皮袄，  
洁白的羊毛象丝绵,  
锋利的剪子，咔嚓响，  
只要我们大家努力来劳动，  
幸福生活一定来到，一定来到。

### 剪羊毛英文版歌词：

Click Go the Shears

Out on the board the old shearer stands  
Grasping his shears in his long bony hands  
Fixed is his gaze on a bare-bellied "joe"  
Glory if he gets her, won't he make the ringer go

CHORUS副歌：  
Click go the shears boys, click, click, click  
Wide is his blow and his hands move quick  
The ringer looks around and is beaten by a blow  
And curses the old snagger with the blue-bellied "joe"  
\---------------------------------------------------------  
In the middle of the floor in his cane-bottomed chair  
Is the boss of the board, with eyes everywhere  
Notes well each fleece as it comes to the screen  
Paying strict attention if it's taken off clean  
The colonial-experience man he is there, of course  
With his shiny leggin's just got off his horse  
Casting round his eye like a real connoisseur  
Whistling the old tune "I'm the Perfect Lure"  
The tar-boy is there awaiting in demand  
With his blackened tar-pot and his tarry hand  
Sees one old sheep with a cut upon its back  
Here's what he's waiting for "Tar here Jack!"  
Shearing is all over and we've all got our cheques  
Roll up your swag for we're off on the tracks  
The first pub we come to it's there we'll have a spree  
And everyone that comes along it's, "Come and drink with me!"  
Down by the bar the old shearer stands  
Grasping his glass in his thin bony hands  
Fixed is his gaze on a green-painted keg  
Glory he'll get down on it ere he stirs a peg  
There we leave him standing, shouting for all hands  
Whilst all around him every shouter stands  
His eyes are on the cask which is now lowering fast  
He works hard he drinks hard and goes to hell at last  
You take off the belly-wool clean out the crutch  
Go up the neck for the rules they are such  
You clean round the horns first shoulder go down  
One blow up the back and you then turn around  
Click, click, that's how the shears go  
Click, click, so awfully quick  
You pull out a sheep he'll give a kick  
And still hear your shears going click, click, click
