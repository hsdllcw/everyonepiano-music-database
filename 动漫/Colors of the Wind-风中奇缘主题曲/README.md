Colors of the Wind歌词：

Think you own whatever land you land on  
Earth is just a dead thing you can claim  
But I know every rock and tree and creature  
Has a life,has a spirit,has a name  
Think the only people who are people  
Are the people who look and think like you  
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger  
You learn things you never knew  
You never knew  
Have you ever heard the wolf cry  
To the blue corn moon  
Or ask the grinning bobcat why he grinned  
Can you sing with all the voices  
Of the mountains  
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind  
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind

Come run the hidden pinet rails of the forest  
Come taste the sun-sweet berries of the earth  
Come roll in all the riches all around you  
And for once never wonder what they're worth  
The rainstorm and the rivers are my brothers  
And the heron and the other are my friends  
And we are all connected to each other  
In a circle in a hoop that never ends  
Have you ever heard the wolf cry  
To the blue corn moon  
Or let the eagle tell you where he’s been  
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain  
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind  
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind  
How high does the sycamore grow  
If you cut it down then you’ll never know  
And you‘ll never hear the wolf cry  
To the blue corn moon  
For whether we are white of copper-skinned  
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain  
We need to paint with all the colors of the wind  
You can own the earth and still  
All you’ll own is earth until  
You can paint with all the colors of the wind
