### FLARE歌词：

Silence  
And nowhere near the sky  
Living in this darkness paved in strife  
Before I lose fire  
I've gotta find what I need  
All of time's a fight to strive till I get out  
Where do we go for life  
Coming back again into focus  
I know  
Deep inside my world  
Watch it fillin' up inside  
Gonna gonna break break break  
Tell me tell me my fate  
Watch me fill with fire  
Brand new brand new pain pain pain  
Show me show me my strength  
Feeling the ruthless  
Still I'll take you down  
Holding my power down's useless  
Come and hit the ground  
Go on and follow it  
Running on through the heat  
Watching the notion in darkness  
Shoot up through the sky  
Hiding inside your strength  
Mind ache stabbed through my soul and now  
No longer in shadows I perceive the light  
World I'm yet to encounter  
I wonder how far I'll see  
Where ever I stand I'll know where I'm to go  
Traveling far arrived  
But this strife will continue again  
I know  
I will overcome it all  
Watch it fillin' up inside  
Gonna gonna break break break  
Tell me tell me my fate  
Watch me flare with fire  
Brand new brand new pain pain pain  
Show me show me my strength  
Feeling the ruthless  
Still I'm moving on  
Gaining more power's the solution  
Freedom's to be found  
There's a battle outside of me and within  
Even when everything's hopeless  
Go on till the end  
Shining inside's your wish  
Starting to face my destiny again  
Where do I go  
Reasons unanswered ask in darkness hard to see  
Show me why  
A shadow forms across the light look inside it find the truth within  
There's a light within the dark  
Showing the meaning forever shine  
Silence  
Arrival past the time  
Now I see the reason for my time here  
Feeling the ruthless  
Still I'll take you down  
Holding my power down's useless  
Come and hit the ground  
Go on and follow it  
Running on through the heat  
Watching the notion in darkness  
Shoot up through the sky  
Rising above my fate
