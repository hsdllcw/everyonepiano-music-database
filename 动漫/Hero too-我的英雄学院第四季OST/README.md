### Hero too歌词：

What am I to be what is my calling  
I gave up giving up I'm ready to go  
The futures left unseen it all depends on me  
Put it on the line to follow my dream  
Tried all my life I've tried to find  
Something that makes me hold on and never let go  
Ohhhh  
Hero too I am a hero too  
My heart is set and I won't back down  
Hero too Strength doesn't make a hero  
True heroes stand up for what they believe  
So wait and see  
So wait and see  
What do they think of me who do they think I'll be  
I could not care less I don't wanna know  
Am I doing right am I satisfied  
I wanna live my life like it's meant to be  
Tried all my life I've tried to find  
Something that makes me hold on and never let go  
Ohhhh  
Hero too I am a hero too  
My heart is set and I won't back down  
Hero too strength doesn't make a hero  
True heroes stand up for what they believe  
So wait and see  
People will judge for no reason at all  
Yea they might try to say your dreams dumb don't listen  
They may look down on me and count me out  
I'm going my own way  
They may look down on me and count me out  
I'm a hero I've got music  
Hero too I am a hero too  
My heart is set and I won't back down  
Hero too Strength doesn't make a hero  
True heroes stand up for what they believe  
Yea I'll be  
Hero too I am a hero too  
My heart is set and I won't back down  
Hero too Strength doesn't make a hero  
True heroes stand up for what they believe  
So wait and see  
I have met so many heroes in my life  
Gave me the strength and courage to survive  
Gave me the power to smile everyday  
Now it's my turn to be the one to make you smile
