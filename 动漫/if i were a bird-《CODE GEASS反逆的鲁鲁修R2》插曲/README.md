### if i were a bird歌词：

when I just can't find my way  
you are always there for me  
when I am out of my way  
you are always there for me  
when I just can't find my way  
you are always there for me  
when I am out of my way  
you are always there for me  
like a bird in the sky  
You set me free you give me one heart  
like a star in my night  
you'll always be a part of me  
when I just can't find my way  
you are always there  
you are always there  
you are always there for me...  
in my darkness dreams  
I hear you call me  
you give me the reason to live  
in my dirty heart  
I hear you call me  
and you reach out to carry me away  
no one can save my soul...  
only you  
like a bird in the sky  
You set me free you give me one heart  
like a star in my night  
you'll always be a part of me  
暗い月 暗示する (昏暗之月暗示)  
その光の先では (这光芒的前方)  
不确かな 存在の (我那不确定存在的)  
仆の梦が 生まれ変わる (梦境正发生着改变)  
急ぎ 生きるけど (虽然活得很匆忙)  
ごめんねーー( 对不起ーー)  
鸟が空を 飞び回れるように (就像鸟儿在天空回旋那样)  
仆は自由に 今なれるんだ (我如今能自由了)  
仆は自由に 今なれるんだ (我如今能自由了)  
鸟が空を 飞び回れるように (就像鸟儿在天空回旋那样)  
仆は自由に 今なれるんだ (我如今能自由了)  
like a bird in the sky  
You set me free,you give me one heart  
like a star in my night  
you'll always be a part of me  
like a star in my night  
you'll always be a part of me
