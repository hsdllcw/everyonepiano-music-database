8AM歌词：

Sunlight  
I can't remember why  
We stayed up till 4AM  
We talked about  
Nothing important and then made love  
The birds wake up we close our eyes

I love how she calls my name  
Inside her dream  
kiss's me still half asleep  
Don't I wish that we could stay like this  
At 8AM

Time flies  
I can't remember the  
First time that we met  
But now I need her  
Like I know she needs me too  
It can't get much better then this

I love how she calls my name  
Inside her dream  
And kiss's me still half asleep  
Don't I wish that we could stay like this  
At 8AM  
I stop the alarm to watch her sleep and think I'd do anything  
If I could make this time rewind forever  
To 7:59

If I could make this time rewind
