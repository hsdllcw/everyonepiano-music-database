### Stronger Than You歌词：

This is garnet  
Back together  
And I'm never going down at the hands of the likes of you  
Because I'm so much better  
And every part of me is saying go get 'er  
The two of us ain't gonna follow your rules  
Come at me without any of your fancy tools  
Let's go just me and you  
Let's go just one on two  
Go ahead and try to hit me if you're able  
Can't you see that my relationship is stable  
I can see you hate the way we intermingle  
But I think you're just mad 'cause you're single  
You're not gonna stop what we've made together  
We are gonna stay like this forever  
If you break us apart we'll just come back newer  
And we'll always be twice the gem that you are  
I am made o o o o of  
Lo o o o ove o o o o of  
Lo o o o ove  
Lo o o o ove  
Lo o o o ove  
Mm mm mm mm mm  
Mm mm mm mm mm  
Mm mm mm mm mm  
This is who we are  
This is who I am  
And if you think you can stop me  
Then you need to think again  
'Cause I am a feeling  
And I will never end  
And I won't let you hurt my planet  
I won't let you hurt my friends  
Go ahead and try to hit me if you're able  
Can't you see that my relationship is stable  
I know you think I'm not somethin' you're afraid of  
'Cause you think that you've seen what I'm made of  
But I am even more than the two of them  
Everything they care about is what I am  
I am their fury  
I am their patience  
I am a conversation  
I am made  
O o o o of  
Lo o o o ove o o o o of  
And it's stronger than you  
Lo o o o ove o o o o of  
Lo o o o ove  
And it's stronger than you  
O o o o of  
Lo o o o ove o o o o of  
And it's stronger than you  
Lo o o o ove o o o o of  
Lo o o o ove
