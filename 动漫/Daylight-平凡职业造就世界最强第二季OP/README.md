### Daylight歌词：

Tears streaming down your sorrow face  
Came a long and painful road, you gave yourself away  
You saw everything, heaven to hell  
You say you need a self redemption, to mend the broken wings  
Drowning in the dark, no place to be  
But I am by your side  
You’re not alone  
Daylight, shed a light so you won’t disappear  
Cause I know where you belong, save your saddened heart  
With a flashback, screaming out but still we’re holding on  
Waiting for the break of dawn for a new day to begin  
Left out to dry, slip through the hands  
Is there a reason anymore to keep me hanging on  
Memories of the past running so fast, can’t look back on yesterday  
Cause I don’t trust in my power  
It haunts my weary soul, I’m lonely  
Crawling in the dark, no where to go  
Will you be by my side  
Forevermore  
Daylight are you there?  
I knew you once before  
But the devil in my head has taken over me  
Oh I need your warm embrace to melt my weeping heart  
Craving for tomorrow  
For a painless day to come  
Maybe nothing matters  
Still I’m searching for the daylight  
Tell me, nothing matters?  
I’m waiting for salvation  
Now I see it shine, blindness is gone  
Rising from the ground  
I am alive  
Daylight in my eyes, I knew it all along  
Fire burning in my soul, to make a better world  
I’ve got everything I need with you there by my side  
Waiting for the break of dawn, for a new day to begin  
Fire burning in my soul  
Daylight, daylight  
Stay a little while longer
