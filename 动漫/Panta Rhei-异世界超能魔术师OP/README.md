### Panta Rhei歌词：

One only that which you feel  
One only that which you see  
One only that which you feel  
One only that which you see  
Crashing to the ground  
Everything is crumbling down  
Without warning all that we know  
有り余るほど 重なった色彩も  
剥がれ落ち消えてく  
Frameだけ虚ろに残る  
Where does the truth lie for us  
象徴を失って迷い始める大衆よ  
Trust in everything that you believe  
Living in this chaotic new world 今目を澄ます  
Trust in yourself not what they believe  
幻想の解の先へ  
さあ 騒然とノイズ響く最中を  
Open up your eyes  
Keep it up  
All doubts will fade out  
Open up open up  
One only that which you feel  
One only that which you see  
One only that which you feel  
One only that which you see  
Like in wonderland  
Everyone says red is blue  
Without lying they don't falter  
感覚はもう 双極線描いて  
交錯することもなく  
どこまでもすれ違う  
Don't let anything stand in your own way  
Fighting in this violent new age 只ここに立つ  
Don't let yourself fall for what they say  
心奥の解を抱いて  
今時の螺旋その中央に  
We gotta get outta this crazy world hurry up  
But there's no way to another world give it up  
Nowhere to go now you gotta stay  
Now dive deep into yourself that's what it takes to wake up  
Trust in everything that you believe  
Living in this chaotic new world 今目を澄ます  
Trust in yourself not what they believe  
幻想の解の先へ  
さあ 騒然とノイズ響く最中を  
Everything that you believe  
You are yourself  
One only that which you feel  
One only that which you see  
One only that which you feel  
One only that which you see  
One only that which you feel
