### Fear Not This Night歌词：

Fear not this night  
You will not go astray.  
Though shadows fall still the stars find their way  
Awaken from a quiet sleep, hear the whispering of the wind  
Awaken as the silence grows in the solitude of the night  
Darkness spreads through all the land and your weary eyes open silently  
Sunsets have forsaken all and must open their eyes now  
Nightmares come when shadows grow  
Ice glows and heartbeats slow  
Fear not this night  
You will not go astray  
Though Shadows fall still the stars find their way  
And you can always be strong  
Lift your voice with the first light of dawn

Dawn’s just a heartbeat away  
Hope’s just a sunrise away  
Distant songs of melody scoring through the night to your heart  
Auroras make circumstance in the solitude of our life  
Pleading silent arias gently grieving in captive misery  
Darkness sings a violent song yet our hope can still rise up  
Nightmares come where shadows grow  
Lift your voice lift your heart

Fear not this night  
You will not go astray  
Though shadows fall still the stars find their way  
And though the night skies fill with weakness  
Fear not press on, hold out and take my hand  
Fear not this night  
You will not go astray  
Though shadows fall still the stars find their way  
Fear not this night  
You will not go astray  
Though shadows fall still the stars find their way  
And you can always be strong  
Lift your voice with the first light of dawn

Dawn’s just a heartbeat away  
Home’s just a sunrise away
