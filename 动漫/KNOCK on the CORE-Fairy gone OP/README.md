### KNOCK on the CORE歌词：

I wake up tired  
Sick bored and expired  
(I wasn't like this, even had a dream too)  
(No one could stop me, bully me, suppress me)  
終わらない this miserable physical life we're in  
とまらない we'll find are way いつも here we pray  
Knockin' on my door and draggin'“real me”out  
(All this time I knew where it was)  
(Fired up, furious to impact)  
Break it down, don't ever give up  
Now is your only chance to change the stance  
Light up！It's your life  
Now is the time, fight for your life  
(Cry not to stop but only to be top)  
扉を開け GO ALL THE WAY OUT！  
Back in reality  
Feeling strong gravity  
(Nothing in this world's free & easy to obtain)  
(It's universal, life is ALWAYS difficult)  
くだらない this visual ritual 捨てて  
つまらなくも beautiful miracle 求め  
Ring the alarm, it's the moment we've waited for  
(Don't worry I won't ever leave you)  
(We're in this game to the end together)  
Break it down, forever stand up  
Make your move in advance to win command  
Attack！ Live your life  
Now is the time, fight for your life  
(Cry just to hold that big shine of yours)  
扉を開け GO ALL THE WAY OUT！  
Just wanna roll Take control  
Don't wanna sell out all my soul  
Wanna be me？ Wanna be you  
Just wanna break out from the blue  
True possession's a combination  
A domination of a guardian  
Don't gotta stay in“stand-alone”  
Won't be afraid cuz it's our zone  
Pushin', grindin', strikin' hate  
Kickin', slayin', beatin' fate  
Shoulda Woulda Coulda's always late  
Neva eva easy's life in state  
That's the reason, we fight right？  
Back to basics, so rewind  
Just live right, to open eyes  
Just show lies will only dry  
so TESTIFY... that YOU CAN FLY  
Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow  
Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow  
Climb up high 鼓動を鳴らせ  
Break it down, don't ever give up  
Now is your only chance to change the stance  
Light up！ It's your life  
Now is the time, fight for your life  
(Cry not to stop but only to be top)  
扉を開け GO ALL THE WAY OUT！
