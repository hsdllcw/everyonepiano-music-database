### Here Comes A Thought歌词：

Take a moment to think of just  
Flexibility, love, and trust  
Take a moment to think of just  
Flexibility, love, and trust  
Here comes a thought that might alarm you  
What someone said and how it harmed you  
Something you did that failed to be charming  
Things that you said are suddenly swarming  
And, oh, you're losing sight, you're losing touch  
All these little things seem to matter so much  
That they confuse you  
That I might lose you  
Take a moment, remind yourself  
To take a moment and find yourself  
Take a moment and ask yourself  
If this is how we fall apart  
But it's not, but it's not, but it's not, but it's not, but it's not  
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay  
You've got nothing, got nothing, got nothing, got nothing to fear  
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here  
[Stevonnie:]  
Here comes a thought that might alarm me  
What someone said and how it harmed me  
Something I did that failed to be charming  
Things that I said are suddenly swarming  
And, oh, I'm losing sight, I'm losing touch  
All these little things seem to matter so much  
That they confuse me  
[Both:]  
That I might lose me  
Take a moment, remind yourself  
To take a moment and find yourself  
Take a moment and ask yourself  
If this is how we fall apart  
But it's not, but it's not, but it's not, but it's not, but it's not  
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay  
I've got nothing, got nothing, got nothing, got nothing to fear  
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here  
And it was just a thought, just a thought, just a thought, just a thought,
just a thought  
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay  
We can watch, we can watch, we can watch, we can watch them go by  
From here, from here, from here  
[Stevonnie:]  
Take a moment to think of just  
Flexibility, love, and trust  
Take a moment to think of just  
Flexibility, love, and trust
