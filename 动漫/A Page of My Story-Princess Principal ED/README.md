### A Page of My Story歌词：

If days were not the same  
I don't know what I'd do  
Imagine me laughing and now  
See me walk in the street  
Then catch a red double bus  
And heaven would find me  
I'd go on a float  
Eased up, I smile a dream  
Now you know  
There is a scene that I...  
I repeat in my soul  
While sippin' a black tea, and now  
Gently touching a tree  
Calming hi-beam from the sky  
Can free me, I feel like  
I'm getting so close  
to laughing sweet with everything  
(Goin' out on)  
Sunday morning, the light has come  
(La la, morning the light's on me...)  
And looking up high  
(Looking around, you'll see all around)  
Vanish worries the light has come  
(La la, shining the light on me...)  
I'm going to try for a pleasant "now"  
(Taking me high up, I'm free)  
Just a page of life in my story  
Sweet and bright  
There is a comfort to all  
And affection reside  
In everything that's in my sight  
Finally opened my eyes  
And now this I realize  
(that)pleasure can find you  
So pleasing to see  
It's like the world is born again  
(Goin'out on)  
Sunday morning the light has com  
(La la, morning the light's on me...)  
And looking up high  
(Looking around, you'll see all around)  
Forget worrise co laugh and smile  
(La la, shining the light on me...)  
And I could fly up and come back around  
(Taking me high up, I'm free)  
I've been lonely, the light was gone  
(La la, you've been alone and you'd cry)  
when nothing was right  
(Nothing was right to me, all alone)  
Every worry and trial become  
(La la, walking along you'll see)  
a story in life like a treasure founed  
(soon to be high up and free)  
(Goin'out on)  
Sunday morning the light has come  
(La la, morning the light's on me...)  
And looking up high  
(Looking around, you'll see all around)  
Vanish worries the light has come  
(La la, shining the light on me...)  
I'm going to try for a pleasant "now"  
(Taking me high up, I'm free)  
Till the time I see this once again  
I'll get by...
