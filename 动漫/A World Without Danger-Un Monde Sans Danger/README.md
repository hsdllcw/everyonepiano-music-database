### A World Without Danger歌词：

There is a world  
That is virtual and different  
It can be so cold  
Makes us stand up for what's right  
Our hope through our lives  
If we reset it to the start  
(Chorus)  
Here we are, going far, to save all that we love  
If we give all we've got we will make it through  
Here we are, like a star, shining bright on your world today...  
Make evil go away!  
Code Lyoko: We'll reset it all  
Code Lyoko: Be there when you call  
Code Lyoko: We will stand real tall  
Code Lyoko: Stronger after all  
A world of machines  
It can shadow human nature  
And all that we need  
Is the way to find the answer  
And one thing is sure  
You can count on us for good  
(Chorus)  
Here we are, going far, to save all that we love  
If we give all we've got we will make it through  
Here we are, like a star, shining bright on your world today...  
Make evil go away!  
Code Lyoko: We'll reset it all  
Code Lyoko: Be there when you call  
Code Lyoko: We will stand real tall  
Code Lyoko: Stronger after all  
We'll do our best,  
To never let you down  
We're up to the test,  
To turn this world around!  
(Chorus)  
Here we are, going far, to save all that we love  
If we give all we've got we will make it through  
Here we are, like a star, shining bright on your world today...  
Make evil go away!
