### For the First Time in Forever歌词：

Anna:  
The window is open, so's that door  
I didn't know they did that anymore  
Who knew we owned eight thousand salad plates?

For years I've roamed these empty halls  
Why have a ballroom with no balls?  
Finally they're opening up the gates

There'll be actual real live people  
It'll be totally strange  
But wow, am I so ready for this change

'Cause for the first time in forever  
There'll be music, there'll be light  
For the first time in forever  
I'll be dancing through the night

Don't know if I'm elated or gassy  
But I'm somewhere in that zone  
Cause for the first time in forever  
I won't be alone

I can't wait to meet everyone! (gasp)  
What if I meet... the one?

Tonight imagine me gown and all  
Fetchingly draped against the wall  
The picture of sophisticated grace  
Ooh! I suddenly see him standing there  
A beautiful stranger, tall and fair  
I wanna stuff some chocolate in my face

But then we laugh and talk all evening,  
Which is totally bizarre  
Nothing like the life I've lead so far

For the first time in forever  
There'll be magic, there'll be fun  
For the first time in forever  
I could be noticed by someone

And I know it is totally crazy  
To dream I'd find romance  
But for the first time in forever  
At least I've got a chance

Elsa:  
Don't let them in, don't let them see  
Be the good girl you always have to be  
Conceal, don't feel, put on a show  
Make one wrong move and everyone will know

Elsa:  
But it's only for today  
Anna:  
It's only for today

Elsa:  
It's agony to wait  
Anna:  
It's agony to wait

Elsa:  
Tell the guards to open up the gates  
Anna:  
The gates

Anna  
For the first time in forever  
Elsa:  
Don't let them in, don't let them see

Anna:  
I'm getting what I'm dreaming of  
Elsa:  
Be the good girl you always have to be

Anna:  
A chance to change my lonely world  
Elsa:  
Conceal

Anna:  
A chance to find true love  
Elsa:  
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know

Anna:  
I know it all ends tomorrow,  
So it has to be today  
'Cause for the first time in forever  
For the first time in forever  
Nothing's in my way!
