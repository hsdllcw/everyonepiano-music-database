### Fixer Upper歌词：

Bulda: What’s the issue, dear?  
Why are you holding back from such a man?  
Is it the clumpy way he walks?  
Cliff: Or the grumpy way he talks?  
Female Troll 1: Or the pear-shaped, square-shaped  
Weirdness of his feet?  
Male Troll 1: And though we know he washes  
Well - he always ends up sort of smelly.  
Bulda: But you’ll never meet a fellow who’s as  
Bulda and Cliff: Sensitive and sweet!  
So he’s a bit of a fixer-upper,  
So he’s got a few flaws.  
Female Troll 2: Like his peculiar brain dear,  
Male Troll 2: His thing with the reindeer.  
Troll Duet: That’s a little outside of nature’s laws!  
Small Group of Trolls: So he’s a bit of a fixer-upper,  
but this we’re certain of  
You can fix this fixer-upper  
Up with a little bit of love!  
Kristoff: Can we please just  
Stop talking about this?  
We’ve got a real, actual problem here.  
Bulda: I’ll say! So tell me, dear  
Is it the way that he runs scared?  
Male Troll 3: Or that he’s socially impaired?  
Troll Child: Or that he only likes to tinkle in the woods — what?!  
Anna: I did not need to know that...  
Cliff: Are you holding back your  
Fondness due to his unmanly blondness?  
Female Trolls: Or the way he covers  
Up that he’s the honest goods?  
All Trolls: He’s just a bit of a fixer-upper,  
He’s got a couple of bugs  
His isolation is confirmation  
Of his desperation for human hugs  
So he’s a bit of a fixer-upper,  
But we know what to do  
The way to fix up this fixer-upper  
Is to fix him up with you!  
Kristoff: ENOUGH! She is engaged  
to someone else, okay?!  
(beat)  
Cliff: So she’s a bit of a fixer-upper,  
Male Troll 4: That’s a minor thing.  
Male Troll 5: Her quote 'engagement' is a flex arrangement.  
Troll Child: And by the way I don’t see no ring!  
Male Trolls: So she’s a bit of a fixer-upper,  
Her brain’s a bit betwixt.  
Get the fiancé out of the way and  
The whole thing will be fixed.

Bulda: We’re not sayin' you can change him,  
‘Cause people don’t really change.  
We’re only saying that love's a force  
That's powerful and strange.  
People make bad choices if they’re mad,  
Or scared, or stressed.  
Throw a little love their way.  
Female Trolls: Throw a little love their way.  
Bulda and Female Trolls: And you’ll bring out their best.  
All Trolls: True love brings out their best!  
Everyone’s a bit of a fixer-upper,  
That’s what it’s all about!  
Cliff: Father!  
Female Troll 3: Sister!  
Male Troll 6: Brother!  
All Trolls: We need each other to raise  
Us up and round us out.  
Everyone’s a bit of a fixer-upper,  
But when push comes to shove.  
Olaf:  
The only fixer-upper fixer  
That can fix up a fixer-upper is  
Trolls:  
True! true!  
True, true, true!  
Love (True love)  
Love, love, love, love, love  
Love! (True love!)  
True...  
Troll Priest: Do you, Anna, take Kristoff to be your troll-fully wedded?  
Anna: Wait, what!?  
Troll Priest: You’re getting married!  
Trolls: Love!
