### Love Like You歌词：

If I could begin to be  
Half of what you think of me  
I could do about anything  
I could even learn how to love  
When I see the way you act  
Wondering when I'm coming back  
I could do about anything  
I could even learn how to love  
Like you  
I always thought I might be bad  
Now I'm sure that its true  
'Cause I think you're so good  
And I'm nothing like you  
Look at you go  
I just adore you  
I wish that I knew  
What makes you think I'm so special  
If I could begin to do  
Something that does right by you  
I would do about anything  
I would even learn how to love  
When I see the way you look  
Shaken by how long it took  
I could do about anything  
I could even learn how to love like you  
Love like you  
Love me like you
