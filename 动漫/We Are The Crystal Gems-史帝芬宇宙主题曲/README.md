### We Are The Crystal Gems歌词：

If you're evil and you're on the rise  
You can count on the four of us taking you down  
Cause we're good and evil never beats us  
We'll win the fight and then go out for pizzas  
We are the crystal gems  
We'll always save the day  
And if you think we can't  
We'll always find a way  
That's why the people of this world believe in  
Garnet amethyst and pearl and Steven  
If you could only know what we really are  
When we arrived on earth from out beyond your star  
We were amazed to find your beauty and your worth  
And we will protect your kind and we will protect your earth  
And we will protect your earth  
And we will protect you  
I will fight for the place where I'm free  
To live together and exist as me  
I will fight in the name of rose quartz  
And everything that she believed in  
I will fight for the world I was made in  
The earth is everything I've ever known  
I will fight to be everything  
That everybody wants me to be when I'm grown  
The odds are against us it won't be easy  
But we're not going to do it alone  
We are the crystal gems  
We'll always save the day  
And if you think we can't  
We'll always find a way  
That's why the people of this world believe in  
Garnet amethyst and pearl and Steven
