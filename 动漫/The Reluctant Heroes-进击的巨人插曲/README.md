The Reluctant Heroes歌词：

  
Day by day  
We have lost our edge  
Don t you know  
Forgetten is the life we led  
Now it seems  
You don't care what the risk is  
The peaceful times have made us blind  
  
Can't look back  
They will not come back  
Can't be afraid  
It's time after time  
Once again  
I'm hiding in my room  
The peaceful times have made us blind  
  
So you can't fly if you never try  
You told me Oh long ago  
But you left the wall  
Out side the gate  
So more than ever It's real  
  
It was like a nightmare  
It's painful for me  
Because nobody wants to die too fast  
Remember the day of grief  
Now it's strange for me  
I could see your face  
I could hear your voice  
  
Remember the day we met  
It's painful for me  
Because nobody wants to die too fast  
Remember a day we dreamt  
It's painful for me  
I could see your face  
I could hear your voice  
  
Song for reluctant heroes  
Oh Give me you strength  
Our life is so short  
Song for reluctant heroes  
I wanna be brave like you  
From my heart  
  
Song for reluctant heroes  
Oh Give me you strength  
Our life is so short  
Song for reluctant heroes  
I wanna be brave like you  
  
Can't look back  
They will not come back  
Can't be afraid  
It's time after time  
Once again  
I'm hiding in my room  
The peaceful times have made us blind  
  
So you can't fly if you never try  
You told me Oh long ago  
But you left the wall  
Out side the gate  
So more than ever It's real  
  
It was like a nightmare  
It's painful for me  
Because nobody wants to die too fast  
Remember the day of grief  
And it's strange for me  
I could see your face  
I could hear your voice  
  
Remember a day we met  
It's painful for me  
Because nobody wants to die too fast  
Remember a day we dreamt  
It's painful for me  
I could see your face  
I could hear your voice  
  
It was like a nightmare  
It's painful for me  
Because nobody wants to die too fast  
Remember the day of grief  
Now it's strange for me  
I could see your face  
I could hear your voice  
  
Remember the day we met  
It's painful for me  
Because nobody wants to die too fast  
Remember a day we dreamt  
It's painful for me  
I could see your face  
I could hear your voice
