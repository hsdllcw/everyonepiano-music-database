### Under the Sea歌词：

Ariel, listen to me  
The human world, it's a mess  
Life under the sea  
Is better than anything they got up there  
The seaweed is always greener  
In somebody else's lake  
You dream about going up there  
But that is a big mistake  
Just look at the world around you  
Right here on the ocean floor  
Such wonderful things surround you  
What more is you lookin' for?  
Under the sea, under the sea  
Darlin' it's better down where it's wetter  
Take it from me.  
Up on the shore they work all day  
Out in the sun they slave away  
While we devoting full time to floating  
Under the sea  
Down here all the fish is happy  
As off through the waves they roll  
The fish on the land ain't happy  
They sad 'cause they in the bowl  
But fish in the bowl is lucky  
They in for a worser fate  
One day when the boss get hungry  
Guess who's gon'be on the plate  
Under the sea, under the sea  
Nobody beat us, fry us  
And eat us in fricassee  
We what the land folks loves to cook  
Under the sea we off the hook  
We got no troubles, like is the bubbles  
Under the sea, under the sea  
Since life is sweet here  
We got the beat here naturally  
Even the sturgeon and the ray  
They get the urge 'n' start to play  
We got the spirit, you got to hear it  
Under the sea  
The newt play the flute  
The carp play the harp  
The plaice play the bass  
And they soundin' sharp  
The bass play the brass  
The chub play the tub  
The fluke is the duke of soul  
The ray he can play  
The lings on the strings  
The trout rockin' out  
The blackfish, she sings  
The smelt and the sprat  
They know where it's at  
And oh, that blowfish blow  
Under the sea, under the sea  
When the sardine begin the beguine  
It's music to me  
What do they got, a lot of sand  
We got a hot crustaceuan band  
Each little clam here  
Know how to jam here  
Under the sea  
Each little slug here  
Cutting a rug here  
Under the sea  
Each little snail here  
Know how to wail here  
That's why it's hotter  
Under the water  
Ya, we in luck here  
Down in the muck here  
Under the sea
