**来吧，甜蜜的死亡双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_来吧，甜蜜的死亡_ 原名为《Komm, süsser Tod》（德语），是EVA剧场版《The End of
Evangelion》的插曲，是剧中第三次冲击时全体人类肉体LCL化，回归到莉莉丝时的配乐。

此曲后段插入摇滚现场和演唱会般的音效，欢快的节奏与极度的悲哀气氛形成强大的对比，使人产生更强的心里冲击。

The End of
Evangelion，即为新世纪福音战士剧场版：Air/真心为你，该片主要讲述了在碇原堂急于实施人类补完计划的过程中，SEELE与NERV之间展开了激烈的斗争。

### 来吧，甜蜜的死亡歌词：

I know, I know I've let you down  
I've been a fool to myself  
I thought that I could live for no one else  
But now through all the hurt and pain  
It's time for me to respect  
the ones you love mean more than anything  
So with sadness in my heart  
I feel the best thing I could do  
is end it all and leave forever  
What's done is done it feels so bad  
What once was happy now is sad  
I'll never love again my world is ending  
I wish that I could turn back time  
Cause now the guilt is all mine  
Can't live without the trust from those you love  
I know we can't forget the past  
You can't forget love and pride  
Because of that, it's kill in me inside  
It all returns to nothing  
It all comes  
tumbling down  
tumbling down  
tumbling down  
It all returns to nothing  
I just keep  
letting me donw  
letting me down  
letting me down  
In my heart of hearts  
I know that I called never love again  
I've lost everything  
everything  
Everything that matters to me matters in this world  
I wish that I could turn back time  
Cause now the guilt is all mine  
Can't live without the trust from those you love  
I know we can't forget the past  
You can't forget love and pride  
Because of that, it's kill in me inside  
It all returns to nothing  
It all comes  
tumbling down  
tumbling down  
tumbling down  
It all returns to nothing  
I just keep  
letting me down  
letting me down  
letting me down  
It all returns to nothing  
It just keeps  
tumbling down  
tumbling down  
tumbling down  
It all returns to nothing  
I just keep  
letting me down  
letting me down  
letting me down  
Ah~Ah~Ah~Ah~~  
tumbling down  
tumbling down  
tumbling down  
Ah~Ah~Ah~Ah~~  
letting me down  
letting me down  
letting me down  
Ah~Ah~Ah~Ah~~  
tumbling down  
tumbling down  
tumbling down  
Ah~Ah~Ah~Ah~~  
letting me down  
letting me down  
letting me down
