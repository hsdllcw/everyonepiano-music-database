### Light your heart up歌词：

Because you seem feeling down  
I've been trying to calm & fade it  
But you don't wanna turn around  
Teenage is so complicated  
Cmon, cmon  
Ain't no one who can take your place  
Oh baby...please let me see you smiling  
It's such a pain in the neck we have homework by tomorrow  
I know you're not a person who would be worn out with sorrow  
To fly away from your past is not so easy but dizzy  
Keep your faith  
Raise your lively face  
Just get rid of your broken wings  
You're strong enough by now  
I'll be your spark when you're lost in the dark  
And let me be your sun, be your match to  
Light your heart up  
Light your heart up  
If you want to  
Light your heart up  
Besides you lead a winding road  
There're some trobles make you stumble  
But you're gonna beat them all  
Loner girl is hard to crumble  
I know, I know  
Ain't no one who can touch your heart  
But baby...please let me see you crying  
You're sort of square  
Why don't we ditch that class?  
It's time to chill out  
I know you're not a person who would get excited and shout  
The sky above your thick cloud is not so gritty but pretty  
Keep your faith  
Raise your lively face  
Just get rid of your broken wings  
You're strong enough by now  
I'll be your spark when you're lost in the dark  
And let me be your sun, be your match to  
Light your heart up  
Keep your faith  
Raise your lively face  
Just get rid of your broken wings  
You're strong enough by now  
I'll be your spark when you're lost in the dark  
And let me be your sun, be your match to  
Light your heart up  
Light your heart up  
If you want to  
Light your heart up  
Sing it now, sing it loud  
Sha la la...  
I'm your buddy all the way  
You may thank me day by day  
Sing it now, sing it loud  
Sha la la...  
I'm your buddy all the way  
You may thank me day by day
