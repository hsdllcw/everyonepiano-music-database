**Deja Vu** 是来自意大利的作曲家Dave Rodgers所演唱的一首歌曲，最初收录于1999年的专辑"SUPER EUROBEAT
presents EUROMACH 2"中，后面因为动画《头文字D》使用了此曲而被大多数人而熟知。

《 _Deja Vu_ 》 即是法语“幻觉” 与“既视感”亦或是“似曾相识”的意思，歌曲采用的风格正是《头文字D》多数插曲中都善用的“SUPER
EUROBEAT”风格，碰巧Dave
Rodgers本人所演唱的大部分歌曲节奏与词调也非常喜爱运用这种曲风，这让每一个听到他歌曲节奏的人都有一种恍惚要超越光速的感觉，配合上《头文字D》里各种赛车漂移与追逐的片段加上轮胎与地面连续打滑摩擦的音效，总能让人马上热血沸腾。

而国内很多的网友都喜欢将《DejaVu》的高潮歌词“DéjàVu”利用谐音说出，便是后面所熟知的“逮虾户”。这也是导致如今很多视频弹幕都喜欢在一些夸张的物体移动画面中，刷出“逮虾户”来表达自己的观感想法，而也有的网友会在漂移视频播放着《DejaVu》作为BGM时，用弹幕配合Dave
Rodgers在歌曲高潮瞬间一齐喊出“逮虾户”，也应如此“逮虾户”逐渐成为了一个十分有趣的梗。

### Deja Vu歌词：

See your body into the moonlight  
Even if I try to cancel  
All the pictures into the mind  
There's a flashing in my eyes  
Don't you see my commission the nation  
Has gone running again  
Can't you see now illusions  
Right into your mind  
Deja vu  
I've just been in this place before  
Higher on the street  
And I know it's my time to go  
Calling you and the search is a mystery  
Standing on my feet  
It's so hard when I try to be me woah  
Deja vu  
I've just been in this time before  
Higher on the beat  
And I know it's a place to go  
Calling you and the search is a mystery  
Standing on my feet  
It's so hard when I try to be me yeah  
See the future into the present  
See my past leaves in the distance  
Try to guess now what's going on  
And the band begins to play  
Don't you see my commission the nation  
Has gone running again  
Can't you see now illusions  
Right into your mind  
Deja vu  
I've just been in this place before  
Higher on the street  
And I know it's my time to go  
Calling you and the search is a mystery  
Standing on my feet  
It's so hard when I try to be me woah  
Deja vu  
I've just been in this time before  
Higher on the beat  
And I know it's a place to go  
Calling you and the search is a mystery  
Standing on my feet  
It's so hard when I try to be me yeah  
See your body into the moonlight  
Even if I try to cancel  
All the pictures into the mind  
There's a flashing in my eyes  
Don't you see my condition the fiction  
Has gone running again  
Can't you see now illusions  
Right into your mind  
Deja vu  
I've just been in this place before  
Higher on the street  
And I know it's my time to go  
Calling you and the search is a mystery  
Standing on my feet  
It's so hard when I try to be me woah  
Deja vu  
I've just been in this time before  
Higher on the beat  
And I know it's a place to go  
Calling you and the search is a mystery  
Standing on my feet  
It's so hard when I try to be me yeah
