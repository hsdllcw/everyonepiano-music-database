### Call your name歌词：

She lost her brother a month ago  
His picture on the wall  
And it reminds me  
When she brings me coffee,,, her smile  
I wish I could be with her until my last day  
She said She gave all her love to me  
We dreamt a new life  
Some place to be at peace  
But things changed,Suddenly  
I lost my dreams in this disaster  
I'm crying  
Missing my lover  
I don't have the power  
On my side forever  
Oh Where is my lover  
I got no power  
I'm standing alone. No way  
Calling out your name  
I said I gave all my love to you  
We dreamt a new house  
Some place to be at peace  
But things changed,Suddenly  
I lost my dreams in this disaster  
We don't know what is wrong tonight  
Everybody's got no place to hide  
No one's left and there's no one to go on  
All I know is my life is gone  
I'm crying  
Missing my lover  
I don't have the power  
On my side forever  
Oh Where is my lover  
I got no power  
I'm standing alone. No way  
Calling out your name
