然而 _More Than Just the Spare_ 这首歌曲最终被删除了，主要是因为制片人觉得这首歌曲会使Anna看起来更像是Hans.

### More Than Just the Spare歌词：

Anna: Spare...? Am I really just the spare?  
I’m not part of the town, not born to be queen  
Just somebody hopelessly in-between  
She’s the scholar, athlete, poet  
I’m the screw up, don’t I know it  
But then who could ever compare?  
Of course they’re gonna think I’m just the spare  
Well I won’t care  
So I’m the extra button on a coat  
In case another one comes loose  
But if I have to be a button  
Why can't I be a button that’s of use? (oops!)  
I may lack style and I may lack grace  
And once in a while I might fall on my face  
But this little button deserves a place in the sky  
This button wants to fly  
Wait, buttons can’t fly, it doesn’t make any sense!  
So I’m a rusty horseshoe hanging up  
Over somebody’s old barn door  
And I’ll be hanging there forever  
Just wishing the horse had one leg more  
And maybe I can’t be the perfect one  
And maybe I err on the side of fun  
But horseshoes need a chance to run somewhere  
This horseshoe is more than just a spare  
Someday I’ll find my thing  
A thing that’s on my own  
That thing that makes me part of something  
Not just all alone  
If only all this feeling I have in my heart  
Could mean something to someone, how I’d love to play that part  
So I’m just the second born sister  
Who most of the town ignores  
Like a button, like a horseshoe  
Like a girl who’s bad at metaphors  
Maybe I don’t have a magic touch  
And maybe I don’t have a talent as such  
Just this heart with much too much to share  
So I’ll never be the heir, but I’m more than just a spare
