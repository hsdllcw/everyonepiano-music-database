### Strong in the Real Way歌词：

Steven  
Why do you have to look up to her  
Aside from in a literal sense  
Don't you know that a power that big  
Comes with a bigger expense  
And can't you see that she's out of control  
And overzealous  
I'm telling you for your own good  
And not because I'm  
I can show you how to be strong  
In the real way  
And I know that we can be strong  
In the real way  
And I want to inspire you  
I want to be your rock  
And when I talk  
It lights a fire in you  
Who's ready to get buff  
I don't want to see your gut  
I want to see your guts  
I can show you how to be strong  
In the real way  
And I know that we can be strong  
In the real way  
And I want to inspire you  
I want to be your rock  
And when I talk  
It lights a fire in you  
I want to inspire you  
I want to be your rock  
And when I talk  
It lights a fire in you
