### History Maker歌词：

Can you hear my heartbeat  
你能听见我的心跳吗？  
Tired of feeling never enough  
已经厌倦怠惰的感官  
I close my eyes and tell myself that my dreams will come true  
阖上眼，告诉自己梦想终将实现  
There'll be no more darkness  
你将不再处身黑暗  
When you believe in yourself you are unstoppable  
且在你找到自我之时，无畏险难  
Where your destiny lies dancing on the blades  
于命运归处，刀锋起舞冰面  
You set my heart on fire  
是你点燃我心中火焰  
Don't stop us now the moment of truth
