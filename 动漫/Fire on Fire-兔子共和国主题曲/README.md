### Fire on Fire歌词：

My mother said I'm too romantic  
She said "You're dancing in the movies"  
I almost started to believe her  
Then I saw you and I knew  
Maybe it's 'cause I got a little bit older  
Maybe it's all that I've been through  
I'd like to think it's how you lean on my shoulder  
And how I see myself with you  
I don't say a word  
But still you take my breath and steal the things I know  
There you go saving me from out of the cold  
Fire on fire would normally kill us  
But this much desire together we're winners  
They say that we're out of control and some say we're sinners  
But don't let them ruin our beautiful rhythms  
'Cause when you unfold me and tell me you love me  
And look in my eye  
You are perfection my only direction  
It's fire on fire mmm  
It's fire on fire  
When we fight we fight like lions  
But then we love and feel the truth  
We lose our minds in a city of roses  
We won't abide by any rules  
I don't say a word  
But still you take my breath and steal the things I know  
There you go saving me from out of the cold  
Fire on fire would normally kill us  
But this much desire together we're winners  
They say that we're out of control and some say we're sinners  
But don't let them ruin our beautiful rhythms  
'Cause when you unfold me and tell me you love me  
And look in my eye  
You are perfection my only direction  
It's fire on fire oh  
It's fire on fire  
Fire on fire would normally kill us  
But this much desire together we're winners  
They say that we're out of control and some say we're sinners  
But don't let them ruin our beautiful rhythms  
Fire on fire would normally kill us  
But this much desire together we're winners  
They say that we're out of control and some say we're sinners  
But don't let them ruin our beautiful rhythms  
'Cause when you unfold me and tell me you love me  
And look in my eye  
You are perfection my only direction  
It's fire on fire  
You are perfection my only direction  
It's fire on fire
