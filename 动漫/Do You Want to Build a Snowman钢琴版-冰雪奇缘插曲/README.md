Do You Want to Build a Snowman_
是2013年美国一部以电脑动画技术制成的音乐奇幻喜剧和三维电影冰雪奇缘（英语：Frozen）的插曲。
该片取材自安徒生童话故事《冰雪女王》，是第53部迪士尼经典动画长片。克里斯滕·贝尔、伊迪娜·门泽尔、乔纳森·格罗夫和乔什·盖德为主要配音演员。2013年11月27日于美国上映。

  
该曲描述了安娜和艾莎两姐妹由亲密无间到无奈疏离的心路历程。在MV中，随着安娜的年龄及心境变化，MV镜头在雪地和城堡的场景中切换：纯洁无瑕的雪地象征着她们纯真无忧的童年，而后紧闭的城堡大门与电影情节遥想呼应。

### Do You Want to Build a Snowman歌词：

Anna:  
Elsa?  
(Knocking: Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock)  
Do you wanna build a snowman?  
Come on lets go and play  
I never see you anymore  
Come out the door  
It's like you've gone away-  
We used to be best buddies  
And now we're not  
I wish you would tell me why!-  
Do you wanna build a snowman?  
It doesn't have to be a snowman.  
Elsa:  
Go away, Anna  
Anna:  
Okay, bye...  
(Knocking)  
Do you wanna build a snowman?  
Or ride our bikes around the halls  
I think some company is overdue  
I've started talking to  
the pictures on the walls-  
(Hang in there, Joan!)  
It gets a little lonely  
All these empty rooms,  
Just watching the hours tick by-  
(Tic-Tock, Tic-Tock, Tic-Tock, Tic-Tock, Tic-Tock)  
(Orchestral)  
Anna:  
(Knocking)  
Elsa?  
Please, I know you're in there,  
People are asking where you've been  
They say "have courage", and I'm trying to  
I'm right out here for you, just let me in  
We only have each other  
It's just you and me  
What are we gonna do?  
Do you wanna build a Snowman?
