### Rightfully歌词：

Chained onto me  
My adolescent dreams  
Pulling dragged me deep  
All my body exposed  
Marked up by your shadows  
Tighten up  
Numb your senses  
No fairness is needed for pigs  
Laughters above  
Playful smiles  
Die get rolled  
Bathe in sorrow  
My tomorrow is built upon your flesh  
Slay the last of your kind  
To reclaim what's rightfully mine  
I still dream of you  
Will you be disappointed that I'm not who I used to be  
Will you hold me tightly  
Chained onto me  
My adolescent dreams  
Pulling dragged me deep  
All my body exposed  
Marked up by your shadows  
Piece by piece the tables turn and turn again  
In this eternal game  
Biscuits with clotted dream and milk tea  
Time to roll your d20  
Gods nor demons ready to admit defeat  
Eat up  
Grind your teeth  
They're not that much smarter than us  
Laughters above  
Playful smiles  
Die get rolled  
Swallow your fate  
Lubricate our blades with blood and tears  
And your piercing screams are music to celebrate  
Infiltrate penetrate  
Soon we'll have you destroyed  
Back to the old days  
Slay the last of your kind  
To reclaim what's rightfully mine
