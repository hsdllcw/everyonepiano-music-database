### How You Remind Me歌词：

Never made it as a wise man  
I couldn’t cut it  
as a poor man stealing  
Tired of living like a blind man  
I’m sick of sight  
without a sense of feeling  
And this is how you remind me

This is how you remind me  
Of what I really am

It’s not like you to say sorry  
I was waiting on a different story  
This time I’m mistaken  
For handing you  
a heart worth breaking

And I’ve been wrong,  
I’ve been down  
Been to the bottom of every bottle  
These five words in my head  
Scream,  
“Are we having fun yet?”

Are we having fun yet?

It’s not like you  
didn’t know that  
I said I love you  
and I swear I still do  
And it must have been so bad  
‘Cause living with me  
must have damn near killed you

And this is how you remind me  
(you remind me)  
This is how you remind me  
Of what I really am

It’s not like you to say sorry  
I was waiting on a different story  
This time I’m mistaken  
For handing you  
a heart worth breaking

And I’ve been wrong,  
I’ve been down  
Been to the bottom of every bottle  
These five words in my head  
Scream,  
“Are we having fun yet?”

This is how you remind me  
This is how you remind me  
Of what I really am

It’s not like you to say sorry  
I was waiting on a different story  
This time I’m mistaken  
For handing you  
a heart worth breaking

And I’ve been wrong,  
I’ve been down  
Been to the bottom of every bottle  
These five words in my head  
Scream,  
“Are we having fun yet?”

Are we having fun yet?
