### Before my body is dry歌词：

In the dusty bassment where we met

May you surprised me so much  
Because you're talking now  
I gotta find the truth from many fights  
But I'm all alone  
You're the only one who can help me out  
We'll be as one

We're ready to fight  
Look over there  
They try to kill us for stars  
Our bond has got much stronger than before

Don't lose your way in your mind  
We have to be as one  
Don't be afraid my sweet heart  
This is the way to be more strong

Harbor my deep secret  
It makes me so blue

Run through this game before my body is dry

So it seems there's No other choice  
But to go all out  
Stay with me and let's stand out  
and out shine those trying to get our stars now  
All we have to do is figure out how strong we are  
and what it takes to stay dive  
Sync and learn what we can do to take 'em down  
It's revenge and survive  
For now,we know in part  
And You can feel my heart  
So help me to stay focused so I don't fall apart  
I wanna be complete  
It's not in me to retreat  
I could lose on my own so I really need you with me

I gotta find out who killed my dad  
I hear the voice of you in my mind  
I gotta find out who killed my dad  
I hear the voice of you in my mind so

My blood is pumping  
I'm ready to fight when you are  
Let's let no one break the bond that is ours

Show them what it means to be a shining star  
You have my body  
Let's fight as one  
Can't move my feet in the dark  
I don't wanna be all alone  
Can't feel the heat in my blood  
Do you remember what he said  
Don't lose your way in your mind  
（I really need you with me）  
We have to be as one  
（Help me to stay focused）  
Don't be afraid my sweet heart  
（I wanna be complete）  
This is the way to be more strong  
Harbor my deep secret  
（Fight as one with me）

It makes me so blue  
（Let's take 'em down  
Be a shining star）  
Run through this game before my body is dry  
（You have my body  
I'm ready to fight when you are）
