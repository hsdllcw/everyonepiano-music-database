### Chaos Drifters歌词：

Wanna know what's out there  
錆びた声軋ませ  
Am I meant for something  
歯車が意味を欲しがる  
幾たびも見た夢は等しく醒めて  
救われぬお祈りを捧げる  
So my friend light the fire here  
Light the fire here to find your answer  
Light the fire here yes light your fire here  
For me  
And give it away  
欠けているこの世界で  
ありもしない理想追いかけて  
Pull the trigger you Chaos Drifters  
抗うように願い込めて  
What do I want and what will I see?  
Keep on point the gun in my head  
What do I want and what will I seek?  
Ain't nobody spoil it to me  
What did I want and what did I see?  
Keep on point the gun in my head  
What do I want and what will I seek?  
Burn that riddle til the last scene  
Do we have a shelter?  
選ばれなかった僕らでも  
We believe in something  
朧な光に焦がれる  
白と黒混ぜすぎの灰色の世界  
少しでも真っさらな瞬間を  
So my friend light the fire here  
Just light the fire here to find your answer  
Light the fire here yes light your fire here  
For thee  
To give it away  
As I swallow the lies in vanity  
吐き出して浄化するように  
Pull the trigger you Chaos Drifters  
心のまま撃ちつくして  
What do I want and what will I see?  
Keep on point the gun in my head  
What do I want and what will I seek?  
Ain't nobody spoil it to me  
What did I want and what did I see?  
Keep on point the gun in my head  
What do I want and what will I seek?  
Burn that riddle til the last scene  
Just give it away  
欠けているこの世界で  
ありもしない理想追いかけて  
Pull the trigger you Chaos Drifters  
抗うように意志を込めて  
What do I want and what will I see?  
Keep on point the gun in my head  
What do I want and what will I seek?  
Ain't nobody spoil it to me  
What did I want and what did I see?  
Keep on point the gun in my head  
What do I want and what will I seek?  
Burn that riddle til the last scene  
What do I want and what will I see?  
Keep on point the gun in my head  
What do I want and what will I seek?  
Count my steps til the 13 th  
What did I want and what did I see?  
Keep on point the gun in my head  
What do I want and what will I seek?  
Burn that riddle til the last scene
