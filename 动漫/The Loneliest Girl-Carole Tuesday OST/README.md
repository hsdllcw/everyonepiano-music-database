### The Loneliest Girl歌词：

Celeina Ann：  
It's a little cold in paradise tonight  
Love faded  
I'm finding new forms I'll ride it out  
It's fine for now  
Then you come along and I cry  
Liberated  
I'm seeing clearly now there's no turning back  
And I'm overwhelmed  
Nai Br.XX：  
Do you really want to set the night on fire  
You're my only way out  
Do you really want to turn your life around again  
You know you're my last chance  
Celeina Ann/Nai Br.XX：  
Can you feel my can you feel my  
Can you feel my tears they won't dry  
Can you feel my can you feel my  
Tear drops of the loneliest girl  
The loneliest girl  
Nai Br.XX：  
Can you really love with a broken heart  
In the cold rain  
I'm giving it a try I'll let it fly  
You can count me in  
So when the night falls I'll be on your side  
These eyes don't lie  
'Cause my defeated heart's got nothing to hide  
It's my only vice  
Celeina Ann/Nai Br.XX：  
Can you feel my can you feel my  
Can you feel my tears they won't dry  
Can you feel my can you feel my  
Can you feel my tears they won't dry  
Can you feel my can you feel my  
Can you feel my tears they won't dry  
Can you feel my can you feel my  
Tear drops of the loneliest girl  
The loneliest girl  
Celeina Ann/Nai Br.XX：  
Keep it keep it close to your heart and it won't go  
Keep it keep it close and then you'll start to grow
