### Can You Feel the Love Tonight歌词：

There’s a calm surrender to the rush of day  
When the heat of the rolling wind can be turned away  
An enchanted moment，and it sees me through  
It’s enough for this restless warrior just to be with you  
Chorus:  
And can you feel the love tonight  
It is where we are  
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer  
That we got this far  
And can you feel the love tonight  
How it’s laid to rest  
It’s enough to make kings and vagabonds  
Believe the very best  
There’s a time for everyone if they only learn  
That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn  
There’s a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors  
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours  
And can you feel the love tonight?  
It is where we are  
It's enough for this wide eyed wanderer  
That we got this far  
And can you feel the love tonight?  
How it's laid to rest  
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds  
Believe the very best  
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds  
Believe the very best
