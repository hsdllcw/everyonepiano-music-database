**Untitled** 又名Untitled (How Could This Happen to Me?)，是加拿大流行朋克乐团Simple
Plan的歌曲。

乐队由五位帅小伙组成，分别是主唱Pierre Bouvier、双吉它手Jeff Stinco及Sebastien Lefebvre、贝斯手David
Desrosiers与鼓手Chuck Comeau，在2002年发表了第一张纯正流行朋克专辑《No Pads, No Helmets, Just
Balls》，在欧美市场的几百万张的销量证明了他们并非等闲之辈。但Simple Plan没有冲昏头脑。2004年秋，由金牌摇滚制作人Bob
Rock（曾经为“金属”乐队等担任制作人）担当监制的专辑《Still Not Getting
Any…》（一无所有）的面市充分见证了这五人组合的健康成长。这不再是张专辑纯粹的流行朋克专辑。其第一主打单曲“Welcome to my
life”已经成为全球范围内的热门歌曲；“Shut up”则是生猛有力流行朋克，而“ _Untitled_ ”则是一首动人的情歌。

### Untitled歌词：

I open my eyes  
I try to see but I'm blinded by the white light  
I can't remember how  
I can't remember why  
I'm lying here tonight

And I can't stand the pain  
And I can't make it go away  
No, I can't stand the pain

How could this happen to me?  
I made my mistakes  
Got nowhere to run  
The night goes on  
As I'm fading away  
I'm sick of this life  
I just wanna scream  
How could this happen to me?

Everybody's screaming  
I try to make a sound but noone hears me  
I'm slipping off the edge  
I'm hanging by a thread  
I wanna start this over again

So I try to hold onto a time when nothing mattered  
And I can't explain what happened  
And I can't erase the things that I've done  
No, I can't

How could this happen to me?  
I made my mistakes  
Got nowhere to run  
The night goes on  
As I'm fading away  
I'm sick of this life  
I just wanna scream  
How could this happen to me?

I made my mistakes  
Got nowhere to run  
The night goes on  
As I'm fading away  
I'm sick of this life  
I just wanna scream  
How could this happen to me?
