### Xanny歌词：

What is it about them  
I must be missing something  
They just keep doing nothing  
Too intoxicated to be scared  
Better off without them  
They're nothing but unstable  
Bring ashtrays to the table  
And that's about the only thing they share  
I'm in their second hand smoke  
Still just drinking canned coke  
I don't need a xanny to feel better  
On designated drives home  
Only one who's not stoned  
Don't give me a xanny now or ever  
Wakin' up at sundown ooh  
They're late to every party ooh  
Nobody's ever sorry ooh  
Too inebriated now to dance  
Morning as they come down come down  
Their pretty heads are hurting hurting  
They're awfully bad at learning learning  
Make the same mistakes blame circumstance  
I'm in their second hand smoke  
Still just drinking canned coke  
I don't need a xanny to feel better  
On designated drives home  
Only one who's not stoned  
Don't give me a xanny now or ever  
Please don't try to kiss me on the sidewalk  
On your cigarette break  
I can't afford to love someone  
Who isn't dying by mistake in silver lake  
What is it about them  
I must be missing something  
They just keep doin' nothing  
Too intoxicated to be scared  
Hmm hmm  
Hmm mmm mmm mmm mmm  
Come down  
Hurting  
Learning
