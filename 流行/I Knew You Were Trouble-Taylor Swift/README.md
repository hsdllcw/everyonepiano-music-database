### I Knew You Were Trouble歌词：

(Verse 1)  
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago  
I was in your sights, you got me alone  
You found me, you found me  
You found me-e-e-e-e  
I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that  
And when I fell hard, you took a step back  
Without me, without me  
Without me-e-e-e  
(Pre-Chorus)  
And he's long gone  
When he's next to me  
And I realize, the blame is on me  
(Chorus)  
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in  
So shame on me now, flew me to places I'd never been  
Till you put me down  
Oh I knew you were trouble when you walked in  
So shame on me now, flew me to places I'd never been  
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground  
Oh~a, oh~a, oh,trouble, trouble, trouble  
Oh~a, oh~a,oh,trouble, trouble, trouble  
(Verse 2)  
No apologies, he'll never see you cry  
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why  
You're drowning, you're drowning  
You're drowning-ing-ing-ing-ing  
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street  
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be  
And now I see, I now I see  
I now I see-e-e-e-e  
(Pre-Chorus)  
He was long gone  
When he met me  
And I realize the joke is on me  
Hey!  
(Chorus)  
I knew you were trouble when you walked in  
So shame on me now, flew me to places I'd never been  
Till you put me down  
Oh I knew you were trouble when you walked in  
So shame on me now, flew me to places I'd never been  
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground  
Oh~a, oh~a,oh,trouble, trouble, trouble  
Oh~a, oh~a,oh,trouble, trouble, trouble  
(Bridge)  
When the saddest fear  
Comes creeping in  
That you never loved me... or her or anyone or anything  
Yeah!  
(Chorus)  
I knew you were trouble when you walked in  
So shame on me now, flew me to places I'd never been  
Till you put me down  
Oh I knew you were trouble when you walked in  
So shame on me now, flew me to places I'd never been  
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground  
Oh~a, oh~a,oh,trouble, trouble, trouble  
Oh~a, oh~a,oh,trouble, trouble, trouble  
I knew you were trouble when you walked in  
Trouble, trouble, trouble  
I knew you were trouble when you walked in  
Trouble, trouble, trouble!
