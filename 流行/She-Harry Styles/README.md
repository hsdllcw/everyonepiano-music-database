**She双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_She_ 出自英国男歌手Harry Styles的第二张录音室专辑《Fine
Line》。这首歌他改变了一贯的唱腔，复歌部分没有用他的英伦摇滚嗓，腔体偏上，没有那种落地的实感，但这种飘忽的唱法和歌词传递的信息不谋而合。1分25秒开始，有一个法语女生的声音切片，后期混音叠加进去的。和cherry里的卡密的法语声音相呼应，可以说整张专辑每首歌之间都在相互呼应的！

### She歌词：

Nine in the morning a man drops his kids off at school  
And he's thinking of you like all of us do  
Sends his assistant for coffee in the afternoon  
Around 1：32 like he knows what to do  
She she she lives in daydreams with me  
She  
She's the first one that I see and I don't know why  
I don't know who she is  
She she  
He takes a boat out imagines just sailing away  
Away away  
And not telling his mates not telling his mates  
Wouldn't know what to say  
Wouldn't know what to say what to say  
She she she lives in daydreams with me  
She  
She's the first one that I see and I don't know why  
I don't know who she is  
She  
She she she's the first one that I see  
She  
She lives in daydreams with me and I don't know why  
I don't know where she is  
She she  
Here's for the memories a woman who's just in his head  
Just in his head  
And she sleeps in his bed  
His bed  
While he plays pretend  
Pretend  
So pretend  
Pretend  
She she she lives in daydreams with me  
She  
She's the first one that I see and I don't know why  
I don't know who she is  
She she  
She she she's the first one that I see  
She  
She lives in daydreams with me and I don't know why  
I don't know where she is  
She she
