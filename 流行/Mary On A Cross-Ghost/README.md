### Mary On A Cross歌词：

We were speeding together  
Down the dark avenues  
But besides all the stardom  
All we got was blues  
But through all the sorrow  
We've been riding high  
And the truth of the matter is  
I never let you go let you go  
We were scanning the cities  
Rocking to pay their dues  
But besides all the glamor  
All we got was bruised  
But through all the sorrow  
We've been riding high  
And the truth of the matter is  
I never let you go let you go  
You go down just like holy Mary  
Mary on a Mary on a 'cross  
Not just another bloody Mary  
Mary on a Mary on a 'cross  
If you choose to run away with me  
I will tickle you internally  
And I see nothing wrong with that  
We were searching for reasons  
To play by the rules  
But we quickly found out  
It was just for fools  
Now through all the sorrow  
We'll be riding high  
And the truth of the matter is  
I never let you go let you go  
You go down just like holy Mary  
Mary on a Mary on a 'cross  
Not just another bloody Mary  
Mary on a Mary on a  
You go down just like holy Mary  
Mary on a Mary on a 'cross  
Your beauty never ever scared me  
Mary on a Mary on a 'cross  
If you choose to run away with me  
I will tickle you internally  
And I see nothing wrong with that  
Mary on a Mary on a 'cross  
Nothing wrong with that  
Mary on a Mary on a 'cross  
Nothing wrong with that  
Mary on a Mary on a 'cross  
Mary on a Mary on a 'cross
