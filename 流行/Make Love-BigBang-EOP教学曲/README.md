Make Love歌词：

演唱：Big Bang

Forever you my girl Forever be my world

Remember that One day  
I held your hands and I kissed your lips then I told you  
Our love was meant to be and always will forever  
Give me that happiness I get from you just being there

I always see you when I close my eyes, you're on my mind  
So can't you see, I need you right here wit me, close by my side  
This time fo sho, Gonna let you know,  
My love is straight from the heart

Forever you my girl Forever be my world  
You are the only one  
The only one I'll ever need , my life is you & me  
Forever you my girl Forever be my world  
You are the only one  
I'll never break your heart “no”, so baby don't let go

Even through the hard times  
We made it through just fine  
When it hurt we put in da work  
To show that I'm yours  
And that your mine  
That's how we got this far  
Let's never be apart  
Girl, you're my queen  
I'm here for you  
'Cuz you're my everything

You always make me feel like everythings gon' be alright  
Wit the things u do, becuz it's you the real true love of my life  
This time fo sho, Gonna let you know,  
My love is straight from the heart

Forever you my girl Forever be my world  
You are the only one  
The only one I’ll ever need , my life is you & me  
Forever you my girl Forever be my world  
You are the only one  
I'll never break your heart “no”, so baby don't let go

Uh... Baby!  
You know I'd walk them miles  
Climb mountains switch up styles  
All I wanna do, is be with you  
Ain't no matter what, where and how  
Right here and now  
We can both get down  
Straight work it out  
Yeah i like that sound  
Bump'n grindin' perfect timin'  
Lets dine and both be proud

Yeah Yeah  
Gonna take you on a joyride today  
Me and you stay true never hesitate  
To make love -- Sho nuff  
You're the only one I’m ever thinkin' of  
Just to hold you baby i can hardly wait  
As we go through the motions damn it's great  
To make love -- Sho 'nuff  
We're gonna take it to the end and that's what's up

You are the only one I want to grow old with I know  
Anywhere you are baby, that’s where I’ll go  
So just take my hand and say that you will never let it go  
Two hearts always beating as one forever more

Forever you my girl Forever be my world  
You are the only one  
The only one I’ll ever need , my life is you & me  
Forever you my girl Forever be my world  
You are the only one  
I'll never break your heart “no”, so baby don't let go  
I'm nothing without you I'm nothing without you girl  
I'm nothing without you I'm nothing without you girl  
my love
