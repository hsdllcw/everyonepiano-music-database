**I Don't Want to Be** 是美国流行摇滚歌手Gavin DeGraw所演唱的歌曲。Gavin
DeGraw是唱摇滚的，他的声音虽然单薄但由此使得他的声音张力十足，就好像橡皮筋一样。

  
在他的歌曲中，低音下浅的不算太足，但出色的爆发力使他的声音在中高音域绝对刺激了每个人的神经，有力的声音使他的歌曲即使旋律流行听起来也是力量十足，给听者强大的冲击。在《
_I Don't Want To Be_
》中，副歌部分上口的旋律搭配上出色的演唱与和声简直是相得益彰，绝对会令每个人都为之疯狂。而且他在唱法中借鉴了前面两者的优点，即在歌曲中加入free
solo的成分。而在ending部分，他便用骚灵乐free style的演唱方式进行solo，与Maroon
5有异曲同工之处，但声音力量上的不同也使得冲击力更加的强烈，听起来非常的过瘾。

### I Don't Want to Be歌词：

i don't need to be anything other than a prison guard's son  
i don't need to be anything other than a specialist's son  
i don't have to be anyone other than a birth of two souls in one  
part of where i'm going is knowing where i'm coming from  
i don't wanna be anything other than what i've been trying to be lately  
all i have to do is think of me and have peace of my mind  
i 'm tired of looking 'round roms wondering what i gotta do or who i'm
supposed to be  
i don't wanna be anything other than me  
i'm surrounded by liars everywhere i turn  
i'm surrounded by imposters everywhere i turn  
i'm surrounded by a identity crisis evreywhere i turn  
am i the only one to notice?  
i can't be the only one who's learned  
i don't want to be anything other than what i've been trying to be lately  
all i have to do is think of me and have peace of mind  
i'm tired of looking 'round rooms wondering what i gotta do  
i don't want to be anything other than me  
can i have everyone's attention please  
if you're not like this and that  
you're gonna have to leave  
i came from the mountain, the crust of creation  
my whole situation made from clay, dust, stone  
and now i'm telling everybody  
i don't want to be anything other than what i've been trying to be lately  
all i have to do is think of me and have peace of mind  
i'm tired of looking 'round rooms wondering what i gotta to do or who i'm
supposed to be  
i don't want to be anything other than me  
i don't want to be  
i don't want to be  
i don't want to be
