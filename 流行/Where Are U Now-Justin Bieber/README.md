Where Are U Now歌词：

Where are you now  
When I need you the most  
Why don't you take my hand  
I want to be close

Help me when I am down  
Lift me up off the ground  
Teach me right from wrong  
Help me to stay strong

So take my hand and walk with me.  
Show me what to be  
I need you to set me free yeah

Where are you now

[Chorus:]  
Where are you now  
Now that I'm half-grown.  
Why are we far apart?  
I feel so alone

Where are you now,  
When nothing's going right?  
Where are you now?  
I can't see the light.

So take my hand and walk with me.  
Show me what to be.  
I need you to set me free, yeah yeah

I need you  
To need me  
Can't you see me  
How could you leave me  
My heart is half empty  
I'm not whole  
When you're not with me

I want you  
Here with me  
To guide me  
Hold me  
And love me now

Where are you now?  
Ohh  
Where are you now?

So take my hand and walk with me.  
Show me what to be, yeah  
I need you to set me free, yeah.

Where are you now?  
Yeah, yeah, oh-oh.  
Yeah.
