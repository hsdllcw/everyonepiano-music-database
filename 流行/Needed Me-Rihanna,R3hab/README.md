### Needed Me歌词：

[YG:]  
Mustard on the beat ho!

[Rihanna:]  
I was good on my own, that's the way it was, that's the way it was  
You was good on the low for a faded fuck, on some faded love  
Shit, what the fuck you complaining for?  
Feeling jaded, huh?  
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to you  
Had some fun on the run though I give it to you

But, baby, don't get it twisted  
You was just another nigga on the hit list  
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch  
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?  
Fuck your white horse and a carriage  
Bet you never could imagine  
Never told you, you could have it

You needed me  
Ooh, you needed me  
Feel a little more and give a little less  
Know you hate to confess  
But, baby, who, you needed me

You been rollin' around, shit, I'm rolling up  
Light and roll it up  
Break it down like a pound, shit was never us  
Shit was never us  
That's the real on the real. Are you serious?  
How you feel, how you feel?  
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to you  
Had some fun on the run though, I give it to you

But, baby, don't get it twisted (don't get)  
You was just another nigga on the hit list  
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch  
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?  
Fuck your white horse and a carriage  
Bet you never could imagine  
Never told you, you could have it

You needed me  
Ooh, you needed me  
To feel a little more and give a little less  
Know you hate to confess  
But, baby, who, you needed me
