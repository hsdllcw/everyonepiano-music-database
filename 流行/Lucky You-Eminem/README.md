**Lucky You双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Lucky You_ 是Eminem与Joyner
Lucas合作的歌曲，收录在Eminem的专辑Kamikaze中。Eminem的韵脚依然无懈可击，流淌的说唱就像四季的河流一样多变华丽，天赋让他睥睨群雄霸气不减。更重要的是，当其他从贫民窟走出来的说唱明星开始炫耀自己有多少车子、票子、马子，或者拥有多国护照，谁都奈何我不得的时候，中年Eminem却低头审视自己的灵魂，并直面了自己是一个并不怎么崇高的恶棍的现实。心口相连，凤凰涅槃，越颓靡越励志。

### Lucky You歌词：

Joyner Lucas：  
Whoa Joyner Joyner yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah I done did a lot of things in my day I admit it  
I don't take back what I say if I said it then I meant it  
All my life I want a Grammy but I'll prolly never get it  
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherf**kin' ribbon  
F**k the system I'm that n**ga bend the law cut the rules  
I'm about to risk it all I ain't got too much to lose  
Y'all been eatin' long enough it's my turn to cut the food  
Pass the plate  
Where my drink  
This my day lucky you  
F**k you too woo  
Y'all gotta move y'all gotta move y'all gotta move  
Give me some room give me some room give me the juice  
Hop out the coupe hop out the coupe hop out and shoot  
Y'all gotta move y'all gotta move give me the juice  
Back on my bullsh*t my back to the wall  
Turn my back on you all of you finished  
Back to these bullets it's back to the job  
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'  
Back on my hood sh*t it's back to the pushin'  
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'  
Can't f**k with you rappers you practically suckin'  
You mighta went platinum but that don't mean nothin'  
I'm actually buzzin' this time  
Straight out the kitchen I told 'em the oven is mine  
I do not f**k with you guys  
If I don't kill you just know you gon' suffer this time  
I ain't no gangster but I got some bangers  
Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives  
Choppers and jammies a partridge a pear tree  
My twelve days of Christmas was nothin' but lies  
I run at you hard like a sumo sumo  
They say I talk like a chulo chulo  
I live in Mars I'm not Bruno woo  
B**ch I'm a dog call me Cujo rah  
You play your cards I reverse on you all  
And I might just drop 4 like a Uno bup  
Cállate boca mejor maricón little puto and all of you culo  
They've invented a level off in the ghetto to ghetto  
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now  
Sh*t get relevant until the beef die down  
In truth a n**ga just really want me tied down  
I've been alone and I never needed nobody  
Just only me and my shawty I'll tell these n**gas to lie down  
Keep all the money I never wanted the lifestyle  
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now  
I said ain't no love for the other side  
Or anyone who ever want smoke  
Joyner  
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope  
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path  
N**ga wrong way wrong road  
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast  
I just bought a f**kin' lawn mower  
Eminem：  
I done said a lotta things in my day I admit it  
This is payback in a way I regret it that I did it  
I done won a couple Grammys but I sold my soul to get 'em  
Wasn't in it for the trophies just the f**kin' recognition  
F**k's the difference  
I'm that cracker bend the law f**k the rules  
Man I used to risk it all now I got too much to lose  
I been eatin' long enough man my stomach should be full  
I just ate lick the plate my buffet lucky me  
F**k you think  
Woo  
I got a couple of mansions  
Still I don't have any manners  
You got a couple of ghost writers  
But to these kids it don't actually matter  
They're askin' me  
What the f**k happened to hip-hop  
I said I don't have any answers  
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album  
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers  
And actually comin' from humble beginnings  
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning  
I wish I could say  
What a wonderful feeling  
We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling  
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any f**kin' ability  
To even stick to a subject it's killin' me  
The inability to pin humility  
Hatata batata why don't we make a bunch of  
F**kin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em  
F**k it I'm goin' for the jugular  
Sh*t is a circus you clowns that are comin' up  
Don't give an ounce of a motherf**ker  
'Bout the ones that were here before you to make raps  
Let's recap way back MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks  
ADATs where the G Rap's and Kane's at  
We need 3 stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back  
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage  
All the lean rappin' face tats syruped out like tree sap  
I don't hate trap and I don't wanna seem mad  
But in fact where the old me at  
The same cat  
That would take that feed-back and aim back I need that  
But I think it's inevitable  
They know what button to press or what lever to pull  
To get me to snap though lil b**ch  
And if I'm payin' attention I'm probably makin' it bigger  
But you've been takin' ya d**ks in the f**kin' back ho'  
Get it  
On the brink any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'  
Everything wit' acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits  
I'm asleep at the wheel again  
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent  
Of another beat I'ma kill again  
'Cause even if I gotta end up eating a pill again  
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin  
It better be at least 70 to 300 milligram  
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again  
Levels to this sh*t I got an elevator  
You could never say to me I'm not a f**kin' record breaker  
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record  
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made a navigator  
Motherf**ker know I got a right to be this way  
I got spite inside my DNA  
But I wrote 'til the wheels fall off I'm workin' tirelessly ayy  
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for  
Like California wishin' rain would pour in that drought  
Y'all have been prayin' for  
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw  
Still the same Marshall that outlaw  
That they say as a writer might've fell off  
But back on that bull like the cowboys  
Joyner Lucas/Eminem：  
So y'all gotta move yeah  
Y'all gotta move yeah  
Y'all gotta move  
Give me some room give me some room give me the juice  
Hop out the coupe hop out the coupe hop out and shoot  
Y'all gotta move y'all gotta move give me the juice
