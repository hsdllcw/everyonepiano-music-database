### Final Song 歌词：

Please, won't you wait? Won't you stay?  
At least until the sun goes down  
When you're gone, I lose faith  
I lose everything I have found  
Heart strings, violins  
That's what I hear when you're by my side  
Yeah, that's what I hear when you're by my side

But when you're gone the music goes  
I lose my rhythm, lose my soul  
So hear me out before you say the night is over  
I want you to know that we gotta, gotta carry on  
So don't let this be our final song

So don't let this be our final song  
So hear me out before you say the night is over  
I want you to know that we gotta, gotta carry on  
So don't let this be our final song

Baby when we were young  
There was nothing to make believe  
And the songs that we sang  
They were written for you and me  
Melodies on repeat  
That's what I hear when you're by my side  
Yeah, that's what I hear when you're by my side

But when you're gone the music goes  
I lose my rhythm, lose my soul  
So hear me out before you say the night is over  
I want you to know that we gotta, gotta carry on  
So don't let this be our final song

So don't let this be our final song  
So hear me out before you say the night is over  
I want you to know that we gotta, gotta carry on  
So don't let this be our final song

Woo-ooo, take us to a higher ground  
Here and now, whatever you do, just don't look down  
Woo-ooo, underneath the disco light, it's alright  
We could make the perfect sound  
We could make the perfect sound

But when you're gone the music goes  
I lose my rhythm, lose my soul  
So hear me out before you say the night is over  
I want you to know that we gotta, gotta carry on  
So don't let this be our final song

So don't let this be our final song  
So hear me out before you say the night is over  
I want you to know that we gotta, gotta carry on  
So don't let this be our final song

Woo-ooo, take us to a higher ground  
Here and now, whatever you do, just don't look down  
Woo-ooo, underneath the disco light, it's alright  
We could make the perfect sound  
Woo-ooo. take us to a higher ground  
Here and now, whatever you do, just don't look down  
Woo-ooo, underneath the disco light, it's alright  
Don't let this be our final song
