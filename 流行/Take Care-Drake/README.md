### Take Care歌词：

[Rihanna]  
I know you’ve been hurt by someone else  
I can tell by the way you carry yourself  
If you let me, here’s what I’ll do  
I’ll take care of you  
I’ve loved and I’ve lost

[Drake: Verse 1]  
I’ve asked about you and they told me things  
But my mind didn’t change  
And I still feel the same  
What's a life with no fun? please don’t be so ashamed  
I’ve had mine, you’ve had yours we both know  
We know, they don’t get you like I will  
My only wish is I die real  
Cause that truth hurts, and those lies heal  
And you can’t sleep thinking that he lies still  
So you cry still, tears all in the pillow case  
Big girls all get a little taste,ah  
Pushing me away so I give her space,ah  
Dealing with a heart that I didn’t break  
I’ll be there for you, I will care for you  
I keep thinking you just don’t know  
Trying to run from that, say you’re done with that  
On your face girl, it just don’t show  
When you’re ready, just say you’re ready  
When all the baggage just ain’t as heavy  
And the party's over, just don’t forget me  
We’ll change the pace and we'll just go slow  
You won’t ever have to worry,  
You won’t ever have to hide  
You've seen all my mistakes  
So look me in my eyes

[Rihanna]  
Cause if you let me, here’s what I’ll do  
I’ll take care of you  
I’ve loved and I’ve lost

[Drake: Verse 2]  
Yeah  
It’s my birthday, I'll get high if I want to  
Can’t deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to  
Cause you don’t say you love me  
To your friends when they ask you  
Even though we both know that you do (you do)  
One time, been in love one time  
You and all your girls in the club one time  
All so convinced that you’re following your heart  
Cause your mind don’t control what it does sometimes  
We all have our nights though, don’t be so ashamed  
I’ve had mine, you’ve had yours, we both know  
We know, you hate being alone  
You ain’t the only one  
You hate the fact that you bought the dream  
And they sold you one  
You love your friends but somebody shoulda told you somethin’ to save you  
Instead they say,  
Don't tell me, I don't care  
If you hurt, I don't tell you  
You don't care, if you're true

Don't tell me, I don't care  
If you hurt, I don't tell you  
You don't care, if you're true

[Rihanna]  
I know you’ve been hurt by someone else  
I can tell by the way you carry yourself  
If you let me, here’s what I’ll do  
I’ll take care of you  
I’ve loved and I’ve lost
