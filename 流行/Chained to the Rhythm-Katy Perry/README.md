### Chained to the Rhythm歌词：

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]  
Are we crazy?  
Living our lives through a lens  
Trapped in our white-picket fence  
Like ornaments  
So comfortable, we live in a bubble, a bubble  
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, the trouble  
Aren't you lonely  
Up there in utopia  
Where nothing will ever be enough?  
Happily numb  
So comfortable, we live in a bubble, a bubble  
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, the trouble  
[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]  
Aha, look so good  
So put your rose-colored glasses on  
And party on  
[Chorus: Katy Perry]  
Turn it up, it's your favorite song  
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion  
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat  
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie  
Yeah, we think we're free  
Drink, this one is on me  
We're all chained to the rhythm  
To the rhythm  
To the rhythm  
Turn it up, it's your favorite song  
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion  
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat  
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie  
Yeah, we think we're free  
Drink, this one is on me  
We're all chained to the rhythm  
To the rhythm  
To the rhythm  
[Verse 2: Katy Perry]  
Are we tone deaf?  
Keep sweeping it under the mat  
Thought we can do better than that  
I hope we can  
So comfortable, we live in a bubble, a bubble  
So comfortable, we can’t see the trouble, the trouble  
[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]  
Aha, look so good(so good)  
So put your rose-colored glasses on  
And party on  
[Chorus: Katy Perry]  
Turn it up, it's your favorite song  
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion  
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat  
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie  
Yeah, we think we're free  
Drink, this one is on me  
We're all chained to the rhythm  
To the rhythm  
To the rhythm  
Turn it up, it's your favorite song  
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion  
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat  
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie  
Yeah, we think we're free  
Drink, this one is on me  
We're all chained to the rhythm  
To the rhythm  
To the rhythm  
[Bridge: Skip Marley]  
It is my desire  
Break down the walls to connect, inspire  
Ay, up in your high place, liars  
Time is ticking for the empire  
The truth they feed is feeble  
As so many times before  
They greed over the people  
They stumbling and fumbling  
And we're about to riot  
They woke up, they woke up the lions  
(Woo!)  
[Chorus: Katy Perry]  
Turn it up, it's your favorite song  
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion  
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat  
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie  
Yeah, we think we're free  
Drink, this one is on me  
We're all chained to the rhythm  
To the rhythm  
To the rhythm  
[Outro: Katy Perry]  
Turn it up  
Turn it up  
It goes on, and on, and on  
It goes on, and on, and on  
It goes on, and on, and on  
'Cause we're all chained to the rhythm
