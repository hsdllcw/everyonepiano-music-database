### Mary, Did You Know歌词：

Mary, did you know  
That your baby boy will some day walk on water?  
Mary, did you know  
That your baby boy will save our sons and daughters?  
Did you know  
That your baby boy has come to make you new?  
This child that you've delivered  
Will soon deliver you  
Mary, did you know  
That your baby boy will give sight to a blind man?  
Mary, did you know  
That your baby boy will calm a storm with His hand?  
Did you know  
That your baby boy has walked where angels trod?  
And when you kiss your little baby  
You've kissed the face of God  
Mary, did you know?  
Mary, did you know?  
The blind will see  
The deaf will hear  
And the dead will live again  
The lame will leap  
The dumb will speak  
The praises of the Lamb  
Mary, did you know  
That your baby boy is Lord of all creation?  
Mary, did you know  
That your baby boy will one day rule the nations?  
Did you know  
That your baby boy is heaven's perfect Lamb?  
This sleeping child you're holding  
Is the Great I Am
