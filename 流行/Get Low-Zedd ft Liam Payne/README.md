### Get Low歌词：

Chained to a love  
But that don't mean much  
Sensitive tough, you don't get enough  
I've been drowning in your, lost in the rush  
Faded, you stuck? I'll help you up  
I don't care if we get too loud  
Sexy, I want you now  
Bet I could take you there  
Whispering in your ear  
What do you wanna feel?  
Let's just enjoy the thrill  
I'll take over the wheel  
And give you the touch you're missing  
Get low, get low  
Hands on your waist, let's go  
Get low, get low  
Girl, you got the vibe, I'm up for the climb  
Get low, get low  
Hands on your waist, let's go  
Get low, get low  
Girl, you got the vibe, I'm up for the climb  
Beautiful as you are, I wanna light up your dark  
Maybe you don't believe in me  
It's hard to know what you see in me  
Don't be quick to say no  
My chest is your pillow  
Come out of the shadows, I know that you're fragile, yeah  
I don't care if we get too loud  
Sexy, I want you now  
Bet I could take you there  
Whispering in your ear  
What do you wanna feel?  
Let's just enjoy the thrill  
I'll take over the wheel  
And give you the touch you're missing  
Get low, get low  
Hands on your waist, let's go  
Get low, get low  
Girl, you got the vibe, I'm up for the climb  
Get low, get low  
Hands on your waist, let's go  
Get low, get low  
Girl, you got the vibe, I'm up for the climb  
I like the way you take me there  
I like the way you touch yourself  
Don't hold back, I want that  
When the water come down, I'mma get in that  
Get low, get low  
Hands on your waist, let's go  
Get low, get low  
Girl, you got the vibe, I'm up for the climb  
I'm right here, you know, when your waves explode  
Escape the undertow  
Know that you've been broken  
Know that you've been hoping  
Swimming in your ocean  
A new life is floating  
The stars were made to shine  
Reach up and make a wish  
It's a beautiful time, I hope you take a glimpse  
We're the sound of lovers blowing crazy in the wind  
You don't have to pretend  
I don't care where you've been  
Get low, get low  
Hands on your waist, let's go  
Get low, get low  
Girl, you got the vibe, I'm up for the climb  
Get low, get low  
Hands on your waist, let's go  
Get low, get low  
Girl, you got the vibe, I'm up for the climb  
I like the way you take me there  
I like the way you touch yourself  
Don't hold back, I want that  
When the water come down, I'mma get in that  
Get low, get low  
Hands on your waist, let's go  
Get low, get low  
Girl, you got the vibe, I'm up for the climb
