### Gooba歌词：

I tell a n***a don't d**k ride don't blick ride  
Leave it to the double thick thighs twin sisters  
Drop it down and wobble wobble up mami booted up  
She get down and gobble gobble up 'cause my money up  
Slide slide in the Bentley trucker the Wraith trucker  
Your bestie is a d**k sucker I big dub her  
As-salama-lama alaykum you big hater  
You nothin' but a hater hater clout chaser  
Now we catch him at the chicken spot up a couple chops  
Pop that n***a with a hundred shots ra-ta-ta-ta-ta  
DeDe made that n***a Diddy Bop cha-cha-cha-cha-cha  
He thought we was gon' knuckle up b***h I don't box  
And these n***as always talkin' s**t yadda-yadda-ya  
When you see me what you talkin' 'bout f**k you talkin' 'bout  
N***as always wanna chase clout b***h I am clout  
Tell 'em get up out my face now 'fore I grrt  
Are you dumb stupid or dumb huh  
Play me like a dummy like b***h are you dumb  
Are you dumb stupid or dumb huh  
Yeah you got some money but you still f**kin' ugly  
Stupid listen  
When I talk you better listen  
We can make him dance bachata  
Slide over do the cha-cha  
Grrt bah-bah  
Make a n***a go adios  
Dímelo mami  
Fresca you nasty  
Flame up light it  
They see me and get excited  
Two step spin around so fly pilot  
They sick been hot way before Coronavirus  
N***a who did that n***a who did what  
N***a that's my s**t don't bite it  
I tell a n***a don't d**k ride don't blick ride  
Leave it to the double thick thighs twin sisters  
Drop it down and wobble wobble up mami booted up  
She get down and gobble gobble up 'cause my money up  
Slide slide in the Bentley trucker the Wraith trucker  
Your bestie is a d**k sucker I big dub her  
As-salama-lama alaykum you big hater  
You nothin' but a hater hater clout chaser  
You're mad I'm back big mad
