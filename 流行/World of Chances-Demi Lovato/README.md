### World of Chances歌词：

You've got a face for a smile you know  
A shame you waste it when you're breaking me slowly  
But I've got a world of chances for you  
I've got a world of chances for you  
I've got a world of chances  
Chances that you're burning through

I've got a paper and pen  
I go to write you goodbye and that's when I know  
I've got a world of chances for you  
I've got a world of chances for you  
I've got a world of chances  
Chances that you're burning through

Oh, I'm going my own way  
My faith has lost its strength again  
Oh, it's been too hard to say  
We've fallen off the edge again  
We're at an end  
We're at an end

Maybe you'll call me someday  
Hear the operator say the number's no good  
And that she had a world of chances for you  
She had a world of chances for you  
She had a world of chances  
Chances you were burning through  
Chances you were burning through  
Chances you were burning through  
You've got a face for a smile you know
