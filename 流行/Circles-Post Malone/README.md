### Circles歌词：

Oh oh oh-oh  
Oh oh oh-oh  
Oh oh oh-oh  
Oh-oh oh-oh  
Oh oh oh-oh  
Oh oh oh-oh  
Oh oh oh-oh  
Oh-oh oh-oh  
We couldn't turn around  
'Til we were upside down  
I'll be the bad guy now  
But no I ain't too proud  
I couldn't be there  
Even when I try  
You don't believe it  
We do this every time  
Seasons change and our love went cold  
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go  
Run away but we're running in circles  
Run away run away  
I dare you to do something  
I'm waiting on you again  
So I don't take the blame  
Run away but we're running in circles  
Run away run away run away  
Let go  
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go  
I say so  
I knew that this was doomed from the get-go  
You thought that it was special special  
But it was just the sex though the sex though  
And I still hear the echoes  
The echoes  
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go let it go  
Seasons change and our love went cold  
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go  
Run away but we're running in circles  
Run away run away  
I dare you to do something  
I'm waiting on you again  
So I don't take the blame  
Run away but we're running in circles  
Run away run away run away  
Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through  
It's only me what you got to lose  
Make up your mind tell me what are you gonna do  
It's only me let it go  
Seasons change and our love went cold  
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go  
Run away but we're running in circles  
Run away run away  
I dare you to do something  
I'm waiting on you again  
So I don't take the blame  
Run away but we're running in circles  
Run away run away run away
