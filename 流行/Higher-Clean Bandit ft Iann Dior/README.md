### Higher歌词：

I love you  
Under my skin under my skin  
Got me strugglin'  
Don't know where you end and where I begin  
And we feel incredible we feel no pain  
You got me feelin' insane got me strugglin'  
Don't know where you end and where I begin  
Had my head underwater  
Had my mind under covers  
Had my faith in the gutter  
Underwater water water water water oh  
But when you look at me  
I'm higher higher higher  
Eyes on me  
I'm higher higher higher  
Nothing matters at all when I see you with your eyes on me  
I'm higher higher higher  
Higher higher higher  
Higher higher higher  
Huh I love you  
I'ma pop out with her no lie  
I'ma get away oh baby we slay  
Head in the clouds when I look in your eyes  
I don't got a doubt on the back of my mind  
That you got it got it got it all  
Got it got it got it all  
And you know it's you that drives me crazy  
Know it's you that drives me crazy  
Had my head  
Had my head  
Underwater  
Underwater  
Had my mind  
Had my mind  
Under cover  
Under cover  
Had my faith  
My faith  
In the gutter  
In the gutter  
Underwater water water water water oh  
But when you look at me  
I'm higher higher higher  
Eyes on me  
I'm higher higher higher  
Nothing matters at all when I see you with your eyes on me  
I'm higher higher higher  
Higher higher higher  
Higher higher higher  
Had my head underwater  
Had my mind undercover  
Had my faith in the gutter  
Underwater water water water water  
But when you look you look at me at me  
I'm higher higher higher  
Eyes  
Your eyes  
On me  
On me  
I'm higher higher higher  
Nothing matters at all when I see you with your eyes on me  
I'm higher higher higher  
Higher higher higher  
Higher higher higher  
I love you
