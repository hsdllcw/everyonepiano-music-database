### Till Forever Falls Apart歌词：

Ashe：  
Out on our own  
Dreamin' in a world that we both know  
It's out of our control  
But if s**t hits the fan we're not alone  
'Cause you've got me and you know  
That I've got you and I know  
If the tide takes California  
I'm so glad I got to hold ya  
And if the sky falls from Heaven above  
Oh I know I had the best time fallin' into love  
We've been livin' on a fault line  
And for a while you were all mine  
I've spent a lifetime givin' you my heart  
I swear that I'll be yours forever 'til forever falls apart  
'Til forever falls apart  
FINNEAS：  
So this is it that's how it ends  
I guess there's nothing more romantic than dying with your friends  
And I'm not sorry for myself  
I wouldn't want to spend a minute lovin' anybody else  
Ashe/FINNEAS：  
'Cause you've got me and you know  
That I've got you and I know  
If the tide takes California  
I'm so glad I got to hold ya  
And if the sky falls from Heaven above  
Oh I know I had the best time fallin' into love  
We've been livin' on a fault line  
And for a while you were all mine  
I've spent a lifetime givin' you my heart  
I swear that I'll be yours forever 'til forever falls apart  
'Til forever falls apart  
We never had it from the start  
'Til death do us part  
If the tide takes California  
I'm so glad I got to know ya  
And if the sky falls from Heaven above  
Oh I know I had the best time fallin' into love  
We've been livin' on a fault line  
And for a while you were all mine  
I've spent a lifetime givin' you my heart  
I swear that I'll be yours forever 'til forever falls apart
