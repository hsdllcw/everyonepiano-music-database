### Tattoo歌词：

I don't wanna go  
But baby, we both know  
This is not our time  
It's time to say goodbye  
Until we meet again  
'Cause this is not the end  
It will come a day  
When we will find our way  
Violins playing and the angels crying  
When the stars align then I'll be there  
No, I don't care about them all  
'Cause all I want is to be loved  
And all I care about is you  
You're stuck on me like a tattoo  
No, I don't care about the pain  
I'll walk through fire and through rain  
Just to get closer to you  
You're stuck on me like a tattoo  
I'm letting my hair down  
I'm taking it cool  
You got my heart in your hand  
Don't lose it, my friend  
It's all that I got  
Violins playing and the angels crying  
When the stars align then I'll be there  
No, I don't care about them all  
'Cause all I want is to be loved  
And all I care about is you  
You're stuck on me like a tattoo  
No, I don't care about the pain  
I'll walk through fire and through rain  
Just to get closer to you  
You're stuck on me like a tattoo  
No, I don't care about them all  
'Cause all I want is to be loved  
And all I care about is you  
You're stuck on me like a tattoo  
I don't care about the pain  
I'll walk through fire and through rain  
Just to get closer to you  
You're stuck on me like a tattoo  
All I care about is love  
No  
All I care about is love  
You're stuck on me like a tattoo
