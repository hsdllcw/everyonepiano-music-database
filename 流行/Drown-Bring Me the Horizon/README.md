### Drown歌词：

[Verse 1]  
What doesn't kill you  
Makes you wish you were dead  
Got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper  
And I can't take  
One more moment of this silence  
The loneliness is haunting me  
And the weight of the world's getting harder to hold up

[Pre-Chorus]  
It comes in waves  
I close my eyes  
Hold my breath  
And let it bury me  
I'm not okay  
And it's not alright  
Won't you drag the lake  
And bring me home again?  
[Chorus]  
Who will fix me now?  
Dive in when I'm down?  
Save me from myself  
Don't let me drown  
Who will make me fight?  
Drag me out alive?  
Save me from myself  
Don't let me drown

[Verse 2]  
What doesn't destroy you  
Leaves you broken instead  
Got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper  
And I can't take  
One more moment of this silence  
The loneliness is haunting me  
And the weight of the world's getting harder to hold up

[Pre-Chorus]  
It comes in waves  
I close my eyes  
Hold my breath  
And let it bury me  
I'm not okay  
And it's not alright  
Won't you drag the lake  
And bring me home again?

[Chorus]  
Who will fix me now?  
Dive in when I'm down?  
Save me from myself  
Don't let me drown  
Who will make me fight?  
Drag me out alive?  
Save me from myself  
Don't let me drown

[Bridge]  
Cause you know that I can't do this on my own  
Cause you know that I can't do this on my own  
Cause you know that I can't do this on my own  
Cause you know that I can't do this on my own  
Who will fix me now?  
Who will fix me now?

[Outro]  
Who will fix me now?  
Dive in when I'm down?  
Save me from myself  
Don't let me drown
