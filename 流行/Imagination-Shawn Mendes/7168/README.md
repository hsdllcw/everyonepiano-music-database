### Imagination歌词：

Oh, there she goes again  
Every morning it's the same  
You walk on by my house  
I wanna call out your name

I want to tell you how beautiful you are from where I'm standing  
You got me thinking what we could because

I keep craving, craving, you don't know it but it's true  
Can't get my mouth to say the words they want to say to you  
This is typical of love  
Can't wait anymore, I won't wait  
I need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever

In my dreams you're with me  
We'll be everything I want us to be  
And from there, who knows, maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the
first time  
Or is that just me and my imagination

We walk, we laugh, we spend our time walking by the ocean side  
Our hands are gently intertwined  
A feeling I just can't describe  
All this time we spent alone, thinking we could not belong to something so
damn beautiful  
So damn beautiful

I keep craving, craving, you don't know it, but it's true  
Can't get my mouth to say the words they want to say to you  
This is typical of love  
Can't wait anymore, I won't wait  
I need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever

In my dreams, you're with me  
We'll be everything I want us to be  
And from there, who knows, maybe this will be the night  
That we kiss for the first time  
Or is that just me and my imagination

Imagination  
Imagination  
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)

In my dreams, you're with me  
We'll be everything I want us to be  
And from there, who knows, maybe this will be the night  
That we kiss for the first time  
Or is that just me and my imagination

I keep craving, craving, you don't know it, but it's true  
Can't get my mouth to say the words they want to say to you
