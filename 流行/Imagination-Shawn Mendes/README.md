### Imagination歌词：

Oh there she goes again  
Every morning is the same  
You walk on by my house  
I wanna call out your name  
I wanna tell you how beautiful you are from where I'm standing  
You've got me thinking what we could because  
I keep craving craving you don't know it but it's true  
Can't get my mouth to say the words I wanna say to you  
This is typical of love  
Can't wait any more won't wait I need to tell you how I feel when I see us
together forever

In my dreams you're with me  
We'll be everything I want us to be  
And from there who knows  
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time  
Or is that just me and my imagination

We walk, we laugh, we spend our time walking by the ocean side  
Our hands are jelly intertwined  
A feeling I just can't describe  
All this time we spend alone  
Thinking we could not belong to something so damn beautiful so damn beautiful

I keep craving craving you don't know it but it's true  
Can't get my mouth to say the words I wanna say to you  
This is typical of love  
Can't wait any more won't wait I need to tell you how I feel when I see us
together forever

In my dreams you're with me  
We'll be everything I want us to be  
And from there who knows  
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time  
Or is that just me and my imagination  
Imagination  
Imagination

In my dreams you're with me we'll be everything I want us to be  
And from there who knows  
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time  
Or is that just me and my imagination

I keep craving craving you don't know it but its true  
Can't get my mouth to say the words I wanna say to you
