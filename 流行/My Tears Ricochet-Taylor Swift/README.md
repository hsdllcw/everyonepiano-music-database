### My Tears Ricochet歌词：

We gather here  
We line up weeping in a sunlit room  
And if I'm on fire  
You'll be made of ashes too  
Even on my worst day  
Did I deserve babe  
All the hell you gave me  
Cause I loved you  
I swear I loved you  
Til my dying day  
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace  
And you're the hero flying around saving face  
And if I'm dead to you why are you at the wake  
Cursing my name  
Wishing I stayed  
Look at how my tears ricochet  
We gather stones  
Never knowing what they'll mean  
Some to throw  
Some to make a diamond ring  
You know I didn't want to  
Have to haunt you  
But what a ghostly scene  
You wear the same jewels  
That I gave you  
As you bury me  
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace  
Cause when I'd fight you used to tell me I was brave  
And if I'm dead to you why are you at the wake  
Cursing my name  
Wishing I'd stayed  
Look at how my tears ricochet  
And I can go anywhere I want  
Anywhere I want  
Just not home  
And you can aim for my heart go for blood  
But you would still miss me in your bones  
And I still talk to you  
When I'm screaming at the sky  
And when you can't sleep at night you hear my stolen lullabies  
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace  
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves  
You had to kill me but it killed you just the same Cursing my name  
Wishing I stayed  
You turned into your worst fears  
And you're Tossing out blame  
Drunk on this pain  
Crossing out the good years  
And you're cursing my name  
Wishing I stayed  
Look at how my tears ricochet
