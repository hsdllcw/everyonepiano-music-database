### Chicago Freestyle歌词：

Two-thirty baby won't you meet me by The Bean  
Too early maybe later you can show me things  
You know what it is whenever I visit  
Windy city she blowin' me kisses no  
Thirty degrees way too cold so hold me tight  
Will I see you at the show tonight  
Will I see you at the show tonight  
Ayy truck to the plane to the truck  
Truck to the hotel lobby  
Me I go through underground garages  
Presidential suite on deposit  
Elevator up to the room  
Shower up and then we hit the club  
Touchdown gotta see what's up  
Area code in my phone  
What numbers do I still have  
Who do I know from the past  
Hit one she say she got a man  
Hit another one it goes green  
Must've changed phones on the team  
'Member when you let me in between  
That was 2017  
All good Chubbs'll look around  
Find one that seem my type  
That my dawg and he know what I like  
He done found me plenty in my life  
Problem is I meet a girl tonight  
Then I go and treat her too nice  
Galleria credit card swipes  
I don't even know if she a wife  
But I do know one thing though  
Women they come they go  
Saturday through Sunday Monday  
Monday through Sunday yo  
Maybe I'll love you one day  
Maybe we'll someday grow  
'Til then I'll sit my drunk a*s on that runway  
On this one way  
Two-thirty baby won't you meet me by The Bean  
Too early maybe later you can show me things  
You know what it is whenever I visit  
Windy city she blowin' me kisses no  
Thirty degrees way too cold so hold me tight  
Will I see you at the show tonight  
Will I see you at the show tonight  
Jewelry in the safe on arrival  
Pistol on J for survival  
Lot of people gunnin' for the title  
Lot of people tryna take us viral  
I'm just tryna have a nice night though  
Waiter brought the check for the meal  
She said "Babe I think there was a typo"  
Nah girl I got it that's light though  
I could show you bigger things than that  
It's gon' be a minute 'til I'm back  
Let me give you images that last  
AMEX had a limit in the past  
I had plenty women in the past  
I done plenty sinnin' in the past  
You don't need to know but you can ask  
Stickin' on your backstage pass  
All access 'cause you bad  
You could go wherever with that a*s  
Show to the shower to the truck  
Truck to the club for the party  
You go in first with your girls  
'Cause I don't know who's out there watchin'  
But I do know one thing though  
Women they come they go  
Saturday through Sunday Monday  
Monday Sunday yo  
Maybe I'll love you one day  
Maybe we'll someday grow  
Till then I'll sit my drunk a*s on that runway  
On this one way  
Two-thirty baby won't you meet me by The Bean  
Too early maybe later you can show me things  
You know what it is whenever I visit  
Windy city she blowin' me kisses no  
Thirty degrees way too cold so hold me tight  
Will I see you at the show tonight  
Will I see you at the show tonight
