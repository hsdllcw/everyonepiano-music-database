### Kill Bill歌词：

I'm still a fan even though I was salty  
Hate to see you with some other broad know you happy  
Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one drivin'  
I'm so mature  
I'm so mature  
I'm so mature  
Got me a therapist to tell me there's other men I don't want none  
I just want you  
If I can't have you no one should  
I might I might kill my ex not the best idea  
His new girlfriend's next how'd I get here  
I might kill my ex I still love him though  
Rather be in jail than alone  
I get the sense that it's a lost cause  
I get the sense that you might really love her  
The text gon' be evidence  
This text is evidence  
I try to ration with you no murders no crimes of passion but d**n  
You was out of reach  
You was at the farmers market with your perfect peach  
Now I'm in amazement playin' on my patience  
Now you laying face down got me sayin' over a beat  
I'm so mature  
I'm so mature  
I'm so mature  
Got me a therapist to tell me there's other men I don't want none  
I just want you  
If I can't have you no one will  
I might kill my ex not the best idea  
His new girlfriend's next how'd I get here  
I might kill my ex I still love him though  
Rather be in jail than alone  
I did it all for love  
Love  
I did it all on no d**gs  
D**gs  
I did it all of this sober  
I did it all for us oh  
I did it all for love  
Love  
I did it all of this on no d**gs  
D**gs  
I did it all of this sober  
Don't you know I did it all for us  
Oh I just killed my ex not the best idea  
Killed his girlfriend next how'd I get here  
I just killed my ex I still love him though  
I do  
Rather be in hell than alone
