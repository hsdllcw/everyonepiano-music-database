**Higher双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Higher_ 出自加拿大创作歌手Shawn
Mendes推出的第四张录音室专辑《奇想》（英语：Wonder）。此曲节奏感超强又不觉凌乱无序，正如歌名，特别适合发呆的时候沉浸在自己的世界里。专辑由Mendes、弗兰克•杜克斯、托马斯•赫尔
、约翰•莱恩、里基•里德及内特•梅尔切罗制作，与Mendes以往发行的流行专辑不同，《奇想》是一张以舞台摇滚、强力流行、摇滚及谣曲为主的专辑。

### Higher歌词：

I can't get much higher  
New York in the summertime  
Get close with a bottle of wine  
Last year was a broken heart  
Last year was a broken heart  
Last year was a broken heart  
D**n flip it around what a beautiful start  
You and me on the top of the roof  
Slow dance in the light of the moon yeah  
Never thought it would get this far  
Never thought it would get this far no  
Never thought it would get this far  
Wow flip it around what a beautiful start  
The drinks they gettin' better the view is lookin' nice  
As long as we're together no I can't get much higher high high  
No I can't get much higher  
Let's stay like this forever  
I'll kiss you every night  
As long as we're together  
No I can't get much higher high high  
No I can't get much higher  
All eyes are lookin' at us  
But I can't stop fallin' in love  
Always been the one that I want yeah  
Always been the one that I want yeah  
Always been the one that I want  
Wow look at us now d**n what have we done  
I almost can't believe it  
So please don't wake me if I'm dreamin'  
Whenever I'm with you  
The drinks they gettin' better the view is lookin' nice  
As long as we're together no I can't get much higher high high  
No I can't get much higher  
Let's stay like this forever  
I'll kiss you every night  
As long as we're together  
No I can't get much higher high high  
No I can't get much higher  
Say say you won't let go  
All I know oh-oh oh  
Is I can't get much higher  
I can't get much higher  
The drinks they gettin' better Better the view is lookin' nice Na na  
As long as we're together no I can't get much higher  
Can't get much higher high high  
No I can't get much higher  
Let's stay like this forever  
I'll kiss you every night  
As long as we're together  
No I can't get much higher high high  
No I can't get much higher
