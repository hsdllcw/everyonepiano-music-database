**Dorothea** 出自美国创作歌手Taylor Swift的第九张录音室专辑Evermore（恒久传说）。

Evermore由联众唱片于2020年12月11日发行，距离第八张录音室专辑《Folklore》仅仅不到五个月而已。《Evermore》是上张专辑的姊妹专辑，都是在发行前几个小时就在社交媒体上发布的惊喜专辑。这张专辑主要是独立摇滚和室内摇滚专辑，它以《Folklore》的独立风格为基础进行扩展，并围绕其之前未曾谈论过的一组新颖的叙事故事。

### Dorothea歌词：

Hey Dorothea do you ever stop and think about me  
When we were younger down in the park  
Honey making a lark of the misery  
You got shiny friends since you left town  
A tiny screen's the only place I see you now  
And I got nothing but well wishes for ya  
Oooh this place is the same as it ever was  
Oooh but you won't like it that way  
It's never too late to come back to my side  
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo  
And if you're ever tired of being known for who you know  
You know that you'll always know me Dorothea  
Uh-uh  
Dorothea  
Ah-ah  
Ooh you're a queen sellin' dreams sellin' makeup in magazines  
Ooh from you I'd buy anything  
Hey Dorothea do you ever stop and think about me  
When it was calmer skipping the prom  
Just to piss off your mom and her pageant schemes  
And d**n Dorothea they all wanna be ya  
But are you still the same soul  
I met under the bleachers well  
Ooh I guess I'll never know  
Ooh and you'll go on with the show  
But it's never too late to come back to my side  
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo  
And if you're ever tired of being known for who you know  
You know that you'll always know me Dorothea  
Uh-uh  
Dorothea  
Ah-ah  
Ooh ooh  
Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  
Ooh ooh  
Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh  
Dorothea  
Ah-ah-ah  
Ah-ah  
Ooh
