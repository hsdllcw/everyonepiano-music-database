### Grand Piano歌词：

Am I just a fool?  
Blind and stupid for loving you  
Am I just a silly girl?  
So young and naive to think you were  
The one who came to take claim of this heart  
Cold-hearted,  
shame you'll remain just afraid in the dark  
(And now the people)  
The people are talking, the people are saying  
That you have been playing my heart like a grand piano  
The people are talking, the people are saying  
That you have been playing my heart like a grand piano  
So play on, play on, play on  
Play on, play on, play on  
Play on, play on, play on  
Play on, play on  
Am I being a fool?  
Wrapped up in lies and foolish truths  
What do I see in you?  
Maybe I'm addicted to all the things you do  
Cause I keep thinking you were  
The one who came to take claim of this heart  
Cold-hearted,  
shame you'll remain just afraid in the dark  
The people are talking, the people are saying  
That you have been playing my heart like a grand piano  
The people are talking, the people are saying  
That you have been playing my heart like a grand piano  
So play on, play on, play on  
Play on, play on, play on  
Play on, play on, play on  
Play on, play on
