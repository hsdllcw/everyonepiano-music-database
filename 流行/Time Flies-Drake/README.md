### Time Flies歌词：

Yeah I'm outside in an AMG  
Right outside TT  
Too turnt baby girl you know me  
Still with the dogs that I grew besides  
All the n***as 'round me ride or they die  
Gotta watch the time 'cause it's flyin' right by  
I'm outside in an AMG  
Right outside TT  
Too turnt baby girl you know me  
Who am I  
All the n***as 'round me ride or they die  
Gotta watch the time 'cause it's flyin' right by  
Too turnt baby girl you know me  
I just called shorty on the face dawg  
Just threw on a hoodie it's a Crenshaw  
Way that I been livin' unconventional  
I'm just tryna make it to the engine though  
Certain things just started getting tense dawg  
Think we need to have us an intervention  
I can be your man but may be down the road  
Right now I would rather see my heart turn to chrome  
Rather see my heart turn crystal  
I can't even front like I don't miss ya  
Right now I'm just stuck inside the crib on my own  
Soon as I free up I'm boutta pop up on your phone  
Like I'm outside in an AMG  
Right outside TT  
Too turnt baby girl you know me  
Who am I  
All the n***as 'round me ride or they die  
Gotta watch the time 'cause it's flyin' right by  
Too turnt baby girl you know me  
Heart still on javelin baby  
Too turnt baby girl you know me  
I was pullin' off when they knew me  
Sometimes I wish there was two of me or three of me  
When it was you and me  
I felt like I loved you too much to change you  
You believe in angles more than angels  
Feel like I've been going through too much I explain to you  
But I'm still the same way I was when I came to you  
Everything I have what I had to exchange for you  
Everything I've been through I can't even complain to you  
Wish it stay the same for you sorry  
I'm sorry  
A-a-a-a  
I'm outside in an  
I'm I'm I'm I'm  
I'm outside in an  
I'm I'm I'm I'm  
I'm outside in an  
A-a-a-a I'm outside in an  
I'm I'm I'm I'm
