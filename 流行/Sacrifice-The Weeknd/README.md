The Weeknd，加拿大创作型歌手。他的音乐作品大多节奏舒缓，却又是激情暗涌的，能紧紧抓住听众的心。他通过运用沉闷的低音和大量的Lo-

### Sacrifice歌词：

I was born in a city  
Where the winter nights don't ever sleep  
So this life's always with me  
The ice inside my veins will never bleed  
Every time you try to fix me  
I know you'll never find that missing piece  
When you cry and say you miss me  
I lie and tell you that I'll never leave  
But I sacrifice  
Your love for more of the night  
I try to put up a fight  
Can't tie me down  
I don't want to sacrifice  
For your love  
I try  
I don't want to sacrifice  
But I love my time  
I hold you through the toughest parts when you feel like it's the end  
'Cause life is still worth living  
'Cause life is still worth living  
I can break you down and pick you up  
And fuck like we are friends  
But don't be catching feelings  
Don't be out here catching feelings  
'Cause I sacrifice  
Your love for more of the night  
I try to put up a fight  
Can't tie me down  
I don't want to sacrifice  
For your love  
I try  
I don't want to sacrifice  
But I love my time  
I don't want to sacrifice  
For your love  
I try  
I don't want to sacrifice  
But I love my time  
Oh, baby  
I hope you know that I, I tried  
Oh, baby  
I hope you know I love my time  
I don't want to sacrifice  
I don't want to  
I try  
I don't want to sacrifice  
But I love my time
