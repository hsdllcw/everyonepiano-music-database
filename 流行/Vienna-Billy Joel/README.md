Vienna歌词：

  

Slow down you crazy child  
You're so ambitious for a juvenile  
But then if you're so smart tell me,  
Why are you still so afraid? (mmmmm)

Where's the fire, what's the hurry about?  
You better cool it off before you burn it out  
You got so much to do and only  
So many hours in a day (Ay)

But you know that when the truth is told  
That you can get what you want  
Or you can just get old  
You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through (Oooh)  
When will you realize... Vienna waits for you?

Slow down you're doing fine  
You can't be everything you want to be before your time  
Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight (tonight)

Too bad, but it's the life you lead  
You're so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need  
Though you can see when you're wrong  
You know you can't always see when you're right (you're right)

You got your passion, you got your pride  
But don't you know that only fools are satisfied?  
Dream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true (Oooh)  
When will you realize... Vienna waits for you?

Slow down you crazy child  
Take the phone off the hook and disappear for a while  
It's alright, you can afford to lose a day or two (oooh)  
When will you realize... Vienna waits for you?

And you know that when the truth is told  
That you can get what you want or you can just get old  
You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through (oooh)  
Why don't you realize... Vienna waits for you?

When will you realize... Vienna waits for you?
