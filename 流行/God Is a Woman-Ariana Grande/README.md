近期，作为实力派美国超人气女星Ariana Grande的第四张专辑Sweetener 的第二首主打曲 **God Is a Woman**
也就是“上帝是个女人”已经发布。此曲非常好听，小编觉得这首歌曲具有很大的寓意。所以小编制作了 _God Is a Woman简谱_
以及五线谱，感兴趣的朋友可以免费下载。

其实，歌曲MV真正的意思是 Ariana
Grande并不是想把上帝贴上性别的标签，相反她想表达的是女人也可以做得到更多，上帝应该是虚无无性别化，不该像历史上总是以男性象征出现，男上帝能做的女上帝也一样能做。

歌词下方是 _God Is a Woman钢琴谱_ ，大家可以免费下载学习。

### God Is a Woman歌词：

You you love it how I move you  
You love it how I touch you my one  
When all is said and done  
You'll believe God is a woman  
And I I feel it after midnight  
A feelin' that you can't fight my one  
It lingers when we're done  
You'll believe God is a woman  
I don't wanna waste no time yeah  
You ain't got a one-track-mind yeah  
Have it any way you like yeah  
And I can tell that you know I know how I want it  
Ain't nobody else can relate  
Boy I like that you ain't afraid  
Baby lay me down and let's pray  
I'm tellin' you the way I like it how I want it  
Yeah  
And I can be all the things you told me not to be  
Yeah  
When you try to come for me I keep on flourishing  
Yeah  
And he see the universe when I'm in company  
It's all in me  
You you love it how I move you  
You love it how I touch you my one  
When all is said and done  
You'll believe God is a woman  
And I I feel it after midnight  
A feelin' that you can't fight my one  
It lingers when we're done  
You'll believe God is a woman  
I tell you all the things you should know  
So baby take my hand save your soul  
We can make it last take it slow  
And I can tell that you know how I know how I want it yeah  
But you different from the rest  
And boy if you confess you might get blessed  
See if you deserve what comes next  
I'm tellin' you the way I like it how I want it  
Yeah  
And I can be all the things you told me not to be  
Yeah  
When you try to come for me I keep on flourishing  
Yeah  
And he see the universe when I'm in company  
It's all in me  
You you love it how I move you  
You love it how I touch you my one  
When all is said and done  
You'll believe God is a woman  
And I I feel it after midnight  
A feelin' that you can't fight my one  
It lingers when we're done  
You'll believe God is a woman yeah yeah
