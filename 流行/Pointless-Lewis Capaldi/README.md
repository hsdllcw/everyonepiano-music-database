### Pointless歌词：

I bring her coffee in the morning  
She brings me inner peace  
I take her out to fancy restaurants  
She takes the sadness out of me  
I make her cards on her birthday  
She makes me a better man  
I take her water when she's thirsty  
She takes me as I am  
I love it when her mind wanders  
And she loves it when I stay at home  
I know what she's lost  
And she knows when I feel alone  
From all my airs and graces  
To the little things I do  
Everything is pointless without you  
Of all the dreams I'm chasing  
There's only one I choose  
Everything is pointless without you  
I light the fire when it's cold out  
And she lights up the room  
I hope that she'll love me forever  
She hopes I'll be back soon  
I take her out to the movies  
She takes away my pain  
She is the start of everything  
And I'll be there 'til the end  
I love when she laughs for no reason  
And her love's the reason I'm here  
She knows when I'm hurt  
And I know when she's feeling scared mm  
From all my airs and graces  
To the little things I do  
Everything is pointless without you  
Of all the dreams I'm chasing  
There's only one I choose  
Everything is pointless without you  
I'll wait for you  
I'll wait for you  
You'll wait for me too  
I'll wait for you  
I'll wait for you  
You'll wait for me too  
From all my airs and graces  
To the little things I do  
Everything is pointless without you  
Of all the dreams I'm chasing  
There's only one I choose  
Everything is pointless without you  
Everything is pointless without you
