### Saturnz Barz歌词：

[Intro: Popcaan]  
(Haha)  
(Patois Slang)  
[Chorus: Popcaan]  
(All my life)  
Me hafi live off me [?] so me hafi move sharp on me knife  
(All my life)  
Me president won't me get well tiaman on me wife  
(All my life)  
This system told me I should be a killer just like Rodney Brice  
(All my life)  
No, all my life  
[Verse 1: Popcaan]  
One kill Kobe  
Some boy don't know me  
Throw em off [?] my grandma join me  
"Not a ting, Popcaan" stand up  
I feel I know me  
Four man meals throw out of a school  
A no man story (hah)  
No me get a part to a story  
The world is mine, the world I am  
Me takin' slowly  
Up in this me Cali no more [bonside?] story  
And me work, wake up, and then me work  
For my dogs that know me  
Me laugh and collect those to a [fit?]  
They call me deserter  
Return what music gave me  
Oh I, I'll move in the light like Frisbee  
The dream? Found that and leave that with me  
(Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh)  
[Break: Popcaan]  
All my life  
My dream for who one knows  
Lon, cars and bikes  
[Chorus: Popcaan and Damon Albarn]  
(All my life)  
I'm just sitting by the pearl gates  
I'm at the base of it  
(All my life)  
Saturn's about to make love  
But it's just a heart breakup  
(All my life)  
And it's taken and it's gone  
When you're taking all my rings  
I'm breaking the making  
It's a personal day  
[Break: Damon Albarn]  
With a hologram beside me  
I'll dance alone tonight  
In a different world with you beside me  
All my life  
[Chorus: Popcaan & Damon Albarn]  
(All my life)  
(All my life)  
Saturn's about to make love  
But it's just a heart breakup  
(All my life)  
And it's taken it back  
When you're taking all my rings  
I'm breaking the making  
It's a personal day
