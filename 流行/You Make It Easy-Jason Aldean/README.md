### You Make It Easy歌词：

Like a rainy Sunday morning makes me want to stay in bed  
Twisted up all day long  
You're my inspiration girl  
You take me places put the words right into these songs  
Stealing kisses under cover babe  
See forever when I see your face  
And I swear God made you for me  
You make it easy loving up on you  
Make it easy with every little thing you do  
You're my sunshine in the darkest days  
My better half my saving grace  
You make me who I wanna be  
You make it easy  
You took all my rough around the edges  
Never let it ruffle up your feathers angel  
Yeah I'm down for life you got me wrapped around your finger  
And I like it just in case you can't tell  
You make it easy loving up on you  
Make it easy with every little thing you do  
You're my sunshine in the darkest days  
My better half my saving grace  
You make me who I wanna be  
You make it easy  
Stealing kisses under cover babe  
See forever when I see your face  
And I swear God made you for me  
You make it easy loving up on you  
Make it easy with every little thing you do  
You're my sunshine in the darkest days  
My better half my saving grace  
You make me who I wanna be  
You make it easy  
You make it easy
