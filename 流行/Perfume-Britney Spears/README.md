### Perfume歌词：

Do I imagine it, or do I see your stare?  
Is there still longing there?  
Oh I hate myself, and I feel crazy  
Such a classic tale  
Current girlfriend, ex-girlfriend, I’m trying to be cool  
Am I being paranoid? Am I seeing things? Am I just insecure?  
I want to believe  
It’s just you and me  
Sometimes it feels like there’s three of us in here, baby  
So I wait for you to call  
And I try to act natural  
Have you been thinking ’bout her or about me?  
And while I wait I put on my perfume,  
Yeah, I want it all over you  
I'm gonna mark my territory  
I’ll never tell, tell on myself but I hope she smells my perfume  
I’ll never tell, tell on myself but I hope she smells my perfume  
I hide it well, hope you can’t tell but I hope she smells my perfume  
I hide it well, hope you can’t tell but I hope she smells my perfume  
I wanna fill the room when she’s in it with you  
Please don’t forget me  
Do I imagine it, or catch these moments?  
I know you got history  
But I’m your girlfriend, now I’m your girlfriend trying to be cool  
I hope I’m paranoid, that I’m just seeing things, that I’m just insecure  
I want to believe  
It’s just you and me  
Sometimes it feels like there’s three of us in here, baby  
So I, wait for you to call  
And I try to act natural  
Have you been thinking ’bout her or about me?  
And while I wait I put on my perfume,  
Yeah, I want it all over you  
I'm gonna mark my territory  
So I, wait for you to call  
And I try to act natural  
Have you been thinking ’bout her or about me?  
And while I wait I put on my perfume,  
Yeah, I want it all over you  
I'm gonna mark my territory  
I’ll never tell, tell on myself but I hope she smells my perfume  
I’ll never tell, tell on myself but I hope she smells my perfume  
I hide it well, hope you can’t tell but I hope she smells my perfume  
I hide it well, hope you can’t tell but I hope she smells my perfume
