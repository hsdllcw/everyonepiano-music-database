Seeya歌词：

  
Don't wake me up, I'm winning wars inside my head  
And maybe I'm weak but not beneath the covers of this bed  
Asleep, I'm undefeated in this world of mine  
So let me stay inside this dream and keep me from the light

I've built this place behind my eyes you'll never see  
And you can move my body but please keep my mind asleep  
Beyond the galaxies where there's no space or time  
I will transform, I am reborn to rule over the skies

I, I feel it in my bones  
Escape, the world I know  
It's all in my control  
I, I just wanna stay this way  
Blood pumping in my veins  
I feel it, I feel it

Behind the darkness there's a sea of neon light  
And maybe you think I'm sinking, but you just can't get inside  
Don't try to save me when my mind is finally free  
Cause I'd rather run my own world than face your reality

It's not enough for me to paint with black and white  
Inside my head there are shades of red unknown to waking life  
You think you've traveled far? You've never seen the stars  
Cause the only the way is if I say you can follow me that far

I, I feel it in my bones  
Escape, the world I know  
It's all in my control  
I, I just wanna stay this way  
Blood pumping in my veins  
I feel it, I feel it
