### Invisible歌词：

Avoiding this disaster  
Seemed impossible  
My heart is beating faster  
Fast as it can go  
'Cause I'm overthinking every word  
That was never said or heard  
Happy ever after  
I don't think so  
I'm in love with someone  
Who doesn't know I exist exist  
I stare from afar in my hand-broken heart while I play pretend  
I'm in love with someone  
Who doesn't know I exist wheres the  
And it's you yes it's true  
You don't even know it I can't ever win  
Am I invisible  
Should I let it go  
Would you ever know  
Am I just another crazy laying on the low  
Low low low low  
Am I invisible  
Will you ever see what you do to me  
Breaking hearts in the dark so easily  
Low  
Am I invisible  
Tangled up and tongue-tied  
What have I become  
Always got you on my mind  
Got me feeling dumb  
And I'm tripping over my own feet  
And I'm mad you got the best of me  
Falling for you slowly  
From a distance  
I'm in love with someone  
Who doesn't know I exist exist  
I stare from afar in my hand-broken heart while  
I play pretend  
I'm in love with someone  
Who doesn't know I exist wheres the  
And it's you yes it's true  
You don't even know it I can't ever win  
Am I invisible  
Should I let it go  
Would you ever know  
Am I just another crazy laying on the low low low low low  
Am I invisible  
Will you ever see what you do to me  
Breaking hearts in the dark so easily  
Am I invisible  
Am I invisible  
Am I invisible  
I'm in love with someone who doesn't know  
I exist  
And it's you yes it's true you don't even know  
It I can't ever win  
Am I invisible  
Should I let it go would you ever know  
Am I just another crazy laying on the low low low  
Am I invisible invisible invisible  
Hey yeah  
Will you ever see what you do to me  
Breaking hearts in the dark so easily  
Am I invisible
