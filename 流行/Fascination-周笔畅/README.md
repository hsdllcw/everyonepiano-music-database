**Fascination双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Fascination_ 是周笔畅2017年专辑《Not Typical》七月主打英文单曲，由Daniel Klein、Charli Taft谱曲及作词。

此曲所呈现的音乐风格在80年代欧洲迪斯科舞池文化入侵流行音乐时曾大鸣大放，但这首歌曲并不是复刻那个年代，而是更着重新浪潮(New
Wave)加上合成器流行(Synth
Pop)风格的融合，打造出非典型的流行电音新变奏。笔笔用时髦的唱法，配上入脑的合成器弹奏节拍分明旋律，营造出一种复古时髦的双层感受。

Fascination译作“吸引力”，单曲封面是浩瀚宇宙中的一颗颗粒子，在吸引力的作用下汇聚成了一颗耀眼的星球。笔笔选择在生日当天发行这首歌，不但是送给自己的礼物，更是送给歌迷的礼物。歌迷在音乐的吸引力作用下，也可以汇聚成一股巨大的力量，催促着自己进步。

### Fascination歌词：

I got my sights on you  
Checking you out from my point of view  
Just to be crystal clear to let you know  
I play to win  
Don't wanna wait let's jump right in  
It would be like finding a snowflake in June  
For me to find someone cooler than you  
Since we're in the right place the right time  
Why pretend you don't  
Want me like I want you  
Call it right  
Call it wrong  
Call me when you want  
Baby you're the one  
You're my fascination  
Touch me there  
If you dare  
Hit me with your charm  
Baby you're the one  
You're my fascination  
Whoa I wanna give you all my love  
Whoa I wanna give you all my love  
Whoa I wanna give you all my love  
Baby you're the one  
You're my fascination  
I'm all systems go  
You're overriding me with your control  
It's such a mystery how you take me there  
You shut it down  
Sending me right up in the air  
It would be like finding a snowflake in June  
For me to find someone cooler than you  
You take my breath away  
I don't know what to say  
Don't you want me like I want you  
Call it right  
Call it wrong  
Call me when you want  
Baby you're the one  
You're my fascination  
Touch me there  
If you dare  
Hit me with your charm  
Baby you're the one  
You're my fascination  
Whoa I wanna give you all my love  
Whoa I wanna give you all my love  
Whoa I wanna give you all my love  
Baby you're the one  
You're my fascination  
If you wanna take it to the next level  
Baby say the word and I'll be your girl  
Tell me are you gonna catch me if I fall  
Call it right  
Call it wrong  
Call me when you want  
Baby you're the one  
You're my fascination  
Touch me there  
If you dare  
Hit me with your charm  
Baby you're the one  
You're my fascination  
Whoa I wanna give you all my love  
Whoa I wanna give you all my love  
Whoa I wanna give you all my love  
Baby you're the one  
You're my fascination
