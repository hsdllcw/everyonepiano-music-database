### Classic歌词：

Hey! Where's the drums?  
Oh whoa-oh-oh-oh  
Let's go!  
Ooh girl you’re shining  
Like a 5th avenue diamond  
And they don’t make you like they used to  
You’re never going out of style  
Ooh pretty baby  
This world might've gone crazy  
The way you save me  
Who can blame me  
When I just wanna make you smile?  
I wanna thrill you like Michael  
I wanna kiss you like Prince  
Let’s get it on like Marvin Gaye  
Like Hathaway  
Write a song for you like this  
You’re over my head  
I’m out of my mind  
Thinking I was born in the wrong time  
One of a kind, living in a world gone plastic  
Baby you’re so classic  
Baby you’re so classic  
Baby you,  
Baby you’re so classic  
Four dozen of roses  
Anything for you to notice  
All the way to serenade you  
Doing it Sinatra style  
Ima pick you up in a Cadillac  
Like a gentleman bringin' glamour back  
Keep it reel to reel in the way I feel  
I could walk you down the aisle  
I wanna thrill you like Michael  
I wanna kiss you like Prince  
Let’s get it on like Marvin Gaye  
Like Hathaway  
Write a song for you like this  
You're over my head  
I'm out of my mind  
Thinking I was born in the wrong time  
It's love on rewind,  
Everything is so throwback-ish （I kinda like it, like it）  
Out of my league  
Old school chic  
Like a movie star  
From the silver screen  
You're one of a kind living in a world gone plastic  
Baby you’re so classic  
Baby you’re so classic  
Baby you’re so classic  
Baby you’re class and baby you're sick  
I never met a girl like you ever til we met  
A star in the 40s, centrefold in the 50s  
Got me tripping out like the sixties  
Hippies Queen of the discotheque  
A 70s dream and an 80s best  
Hepburn, Beyoncé, Marilyn, Massive  
Girl you’re timeless, just so classic  
You're over my head I’m out of my mind  
Thinking I was born in the wrong time  
It's love on rewind,  
Everything is so throwback-ish （I kinda like it, like it）  
Out of my league  
Old school chic  
Like a movie star  
From the silver screen  
You’re one of a kind living in a world gone plastic  
Baby you’re so classic  
Baby you’re so classic  
Baby you’re so classic
