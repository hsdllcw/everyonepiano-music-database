### Control歌词：

Early in the morning I still get a little bit nervous  
Fighting my anxiety constantly I try to control it  
Even when I know it's been forever  
I can still feel the spin  
Hurts when I remember and  
I never wanna feel it again  
Don't know if you get it 'cause  
I can't express how thankful I am  
That you were always with me when  
It hurts I know that you understand  
I don't wanna lose control  
Nothing I can do anymore  
Trying every day when I hold my breath  
Spinning out in space pressing on my chest  
I don't wanna lose control  
Sometimes I still think it's coming but I know it's not  
Trying to breathe in and then out but the air gets caught  
'Cause even though I'm older now and  
I know how to shake off the past  
I wouldn't have made it if  
I didn't have you holding my hand  
I don't wanna lose control  
Nothing I can do anymore  
Trying every day when I hold my breath  
Spinning out in space pressing on my chest  
I don't wanna lose control  
I need you to know I would  
Never be this strong without you  
You've seen how I've grown you took all my doubt  
'Cause you were home  
I don't wanna lose control  
There's nothing I can do anymore  
I don't wanna lose control  
Nothing I can do anymore anymore anymore  
Trying every day when I hold my breath  
Spinning out in space pressing on my chest  
I don't wanna lose control
