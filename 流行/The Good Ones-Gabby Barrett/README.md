### The Good Ones歌词：

He's a phone call to his parents  
He's a bible by the bed  
He's the t-shirt that I'm wearing  
He's the song stuck in my head  
He's solid and he's steady  
Like the Allegheny runs  
He knows just where he's going  
And he's proud of where he's from  
One of the good ones  
He's one of the good ones  
A love me like he should one  
Like he wrote the book one  
The kind you find when you don't even look one  
Anybody can be good once  
But he's good all the time  
He's one of the good ones  
And he's all mine  
He's one of the good ones  
You'll know him when you see him  
By the way he looks at me  
You'd say he hung the moon  
I'd say he hung the galaxy  
Nobody does it better  
Oh the way he pulls me in  
I've known a couple bad ones  
But they all led me to him  
He's one of the good ones  
A love me like he should one  
Like he wrote the book one  
The kind you find when you don't even look one  
Anybody can be good once  
But he's good all the time  
He's one of the good ones  
And he's all mine  
He's one of the good ones  
We should all find us one  
They're out there, minus one  
Some of the good ones  
Yeah I got a good one  
A love me like he should one  
Like he wrote the book one  
The kind you find when you don't even look  
Anybody can be good once  
But he's good all the time  
He's one of the good ones  
And he's all mine  
He's one of the good ones  
And he's all mine
