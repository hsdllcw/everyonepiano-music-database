### Hands Of Love歌词：

When the white flag sails, covered in streaks of blood  
There'll be an endless sea, of us rising up  
And the preacher man, and the preacher's son  
Will stand arm in arm, just like everyone

Me longing to be free, I won't let you fade away  
We shed so many dreams, I'll let them fade away

In the hands of love, we carry on  
Stronger than we started  
Be ashamed of the trail behind us  
Wicked is the blinded  
Who we are comes to life, yeah  
Who we are comes to life

When the water spills, the glass will break  
It drips like tears, running up your face  
And the hounds will cry, for the dance of war  
But the sons of joy, their victory will soar

Me longing to be free, I won't let you fade away  
We shed so many dreams, I'll let them fade away

In the hands of love, we carry on  
Stronger than we started  
Be ashamed of the trail behind us  
Wicked is the blinded  
Who we are comes to life, yeah  
Who we are comes to life

Me longing to be free, I won't let you fade away

In the hands of love, we carry on  
Stronger that we started  
Be ashamed of the trail behind us  
Wicked is the blinded  
Who we are comes to life, yeah  
Who we are comes to life

We come alive  
We come alive  
We come alive  
We come alive  
We come to life
