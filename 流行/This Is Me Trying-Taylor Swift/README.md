### This Is Me Trying歌词：

I've been having a hard time adjusting  
I had the shiniest wheels  
Now they're rusting  
I didn't know if you'd care if I came back  
I have a lot of regrets about that  
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout  
Could've followed my fears all the way down  
And maybe I don't quite know what to say  
But I'm here in your doorway  
I just wanted you to know  
That this is me trying  
I just wanted you to know  
That this is me trying  
They told me all of my cages were mental  
So I got wasted like all my potential  
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad  
I have a lot of regrets about that  
I was so ahead of the curve  
The curve became a sphere  
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here  
Pouring out my heart to a stranger  
But I didn't pour the whiskey  
I just wanted you to  
Know that this is me  
Trying  
I just wanted you to  
Know that this is me  
Trying  
At least I'm trying  
And it's hard to be at a party  
When I feel like an open wound  
It's hard to be anywhere these days  
When all I want is you  
You're a flashback in a film reel  
On the one screen in my town  
And I just wanted you to know  
That this is me trying  
I just wanted you to  
Know that this is me  
Trying  
At least I'm trying
