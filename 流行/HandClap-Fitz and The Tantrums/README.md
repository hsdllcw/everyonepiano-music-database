### Heavy Dirty Soul歌词：

Somebody save your soul cause you've been sinning in this city I know  
Too many troubles, all these lovers got you losing control  
You're like a drug to me, a luxury, my sugar and gold  
I want the good life, every good night you're a hard one to hold

Cause you don't even know  
I can make your hands clap  
Said I can make your hands clap

Somebody save your soul cause you've been sinning in this city I know  
Too many troubles, all these lovers got you losing control  
You're like a drug to me, a luxury, my sugar and gold  
I want your sex and your affection when they're holdin' you close

Cause you don't even know  
I can make your hands clap  
Said I can make your hands clap

Every night when the stars come out  
Am I the only living soul around?  
Need to believe you could hold me down  
Cause I'm in need of somethin' good right now  
We could be screamin' till the sun comes out  
And when we wake we'd be the only sound  
Get on my knees and say a prayer: James Brown  
(That I can make your hands clap)

That I can make your hands clap  
(Turn it up)  
That I can make your hands clap

My flesh is searchin' for your worst and best, don't ever deny  
I'm like a stranger, gimme me danger, all your wrongs and your rights  
Secrets on Broadway to the freeway, you're a keeper of crimes  
Fear no conviction, grapes of wrath can only sweeten your wine

But you don't even know  
I can make your hands clap  
Said I can make your hands clap

Every night when the stars come out  
Am I the only living soul around?  
Need to believe you could hold me down  
Cause I'm in need of somethin' good right now  
We could be screamin' till the sun comes out  
And when we wake we'd be the only sound  
Get on my knees and say a prayer: James Brown  
(That I can make your hands clap)

That I can make your hands clap  
That I can make your hands clap  
That I can make your hands clap  
So can I get a handclap?
