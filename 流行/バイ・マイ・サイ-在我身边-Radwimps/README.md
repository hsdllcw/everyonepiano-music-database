### バイ・マイ・サイ歌词：

Now just now I know that I'm happy  
Because you're here with me  
You just you is what I really need  
And all the other thought means nothing to me  
Love is the word I really need  
Because all the other word means nothing to me  
Love is the word I really need  
Because all the other words just make me tell lies  
By my side by my side by my side  
Stay by my side by my side  
Stay by my side by my side by my side  
Stay by my side by my side  
Now just now I know that I'm lonely  
Because you're away from me  
You about you about me is about you and I'll repeat the same  
Verses over and over and over again until you're back to me  
Love is the word I really need  
So all of these affections need a place where to go  
Love is the word I really need  
So please will you come back and kiss on my cheek  
By my side by my side by my side  
Stay by my side by my side  
Stay by my side by my side by my side  
Stay by my side by my side  
流るる意志を以て  
動かぬ意味を越え  
僕には二つ心臓がある  
君を思うと動き出すのが  
By my side by my side by my side  
Stay by my side by my side  
By my side by my side by my side  
Stay by my side by my side  
Stay by my side by my side by my side  
Stay by my side by my side  
By my side by my side by my side  
By my side by my side by my side  
By my side by my side by my side  
You told me that you're mine and you always kissed me instead of hi  
But this doesn't mean that I'm head over toes in with you whatever  
You used to beg me hug and you used to play me tricks  
And all those hugs and tricks we shared is now  
What we call a broken dreams  
I hate myself when my brain tells me  
That I'm lying that everything we went through was just a waste of a time  
So I'm writing this for you and  
I'm writing this for me within full of thanks  
And tears and a pair of ring full of I love you  
This song will almost end but that doesn't mean us too  
Well just in case someday you come to me and says hi
