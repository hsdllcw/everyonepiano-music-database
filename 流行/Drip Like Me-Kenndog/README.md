### Drip Like Me歌词：

I'm sorry for drippin'  
But drip is what I do splish splash  
And one of these days I'm gon' get dressed  
And drip all over you ay ay  
I'm that fly young n***a  
Lil' baby can't you see ay  
Your style is old my fashion cold  
Tell me who drip like me uh  
Lil' baby I don't chase  
I erase and replace  
Man that b***h ain't loyal  
'Cause I just dripped on her face  
Shopping at the finish line  
But you still in last place  
I'm a star and I fly  
B***h I need my space ah  
Kenn with two n's  
'Cause I'm twice as nice twice  
Oh you didn't see the fit  
Then I'm wearing it twice  
And when the Summer hit my fizz  
Gon' be cold as ice hah  
Off-whites so nice but it ain't yo' price  
I'ma hot n***a in the coldest fit  
When you see me walkin' in you gon' notice it  
How you n***as hating on me but you steal my drip  
And steal my pics  
I'm tryna tell these n***as they ain't f**king with me  
I'm sorry for drippin'  
But drip is what I do splish splash  
And one of these days I'm gon' get dressed  
And drip all over you huh  
I'm that fly young n***a  
Lil' baby can't you see  
Your style is old my fashion cold  
Tell me who drip like me uh  
I'm the flyest in the room but you already knew that  
You lying with the fake-a*s clones  
So where the truth at  
You say you big drip with the fit  
But it don't match  
I kill 'em with the drip  
Finish him Mortal Kombat  
Big ol' sauce I be drippin' when I'm dressing  
You trying with them weak-a*s fits  
You need a lesson okay  
I got too much sauce  
N***as thinkin' that I be cheffin'  
But I study dripology n***a class is in session  
Don't slip when I drip in high fashion  
I dripped on the scene but I spill by the gallon  
They tellin' me I'm fly  
So I think that I'm blastin' off  
In a space ship through the stratosphere  
I'm sorry for drippin'  
But drip is what I do lil' n***a  
And one of these days I'm gon' get dressed  
And drip all over you  
I'm that fly young n***a  
Lil' baby can't you see can't you see  
Your style is old my fashion cold  
Tell me who drip like me uh  
True religion fits  
Puma kicks  
Bro you outta here
