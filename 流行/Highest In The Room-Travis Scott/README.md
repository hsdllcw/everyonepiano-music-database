### Highest In The Room歌词：

I got room  
In my fumes  
Yeah  
She fill my mind up with ideas  
I'm the highest in the room  
It's lit  
Hope I make it outta here  
Let's go  
She saw my eyes she know I'm gone  
Ah  
I see some things that you might fear  
I'm doing a show I'll be back soon  
Soon  
That ain't what she wanna hear  
Nah  
Now I got her in my room  
Ah  
Legs wrapped around my beard  
Got the fastest car it zoom  
Skrrt  
Hope we make it outta here  
Ah  
When I'm with you I feel alive  
You say you love me don't you lie  
Yeah  
Won't cross my heart don't wanna die  
Keep the pistol on my side  
Yeah  
Case it's fumes  
Smoke  
She fill my mind up with ideas  
Straight up  
I'm the highest in the room  
It's lit  
Hope I make it outta here  
Let's go yeah  
We ain't stressin' 'bout the loot  
Yeah  
My block made of quesoria  
This not the molly this the boot  
Ain't no comin' back from here  
Live the life of La Familia  
It's so much gang that I can't see ya  
Yeah  
Turn it up 'til they can't hear  
We can't  
Runnin' runnin' 'round for the thrill

Gang  
Raw raw I been pourin' to the real  
Drank

Ah this my life I did not choose  
Uh been on this since we was kids  
We gon' stay on top and break the rules  
Uh I fill my mind up with ideas  
Case it's fumes  
She fill my mind up with ideas  
Straight up
