_Future Nostalgia_ 是阿尔巴尼亚裔英国歌手Dua Lipa的歌曲。这首歌比之前更加具有实验性，带有早期
Madonna俱乐部舞曲色彩的实验舞曲，动感十足。

此曲收录在其即将于2020发行的同名第二张录音室专辑Future
Nostalgia中。专辑概念与风格十分明确：上世纪下旬年代disco电子舞曲，非常适合电影的派对与舞动片段，近来大半欧美圈情迷复古。

### Future Nostalgia歌词：

You want a timeless song  
I wanna change the game  
Like modern architecture  
John Lautner coming your way  
I know you like this beat  
'Cause Jeff been doing the d**n thing  
You wanna turn it up loud  
Future nostalgia is the name  
I know you're dying trying to figure me out  
My name's on the tip of your tongue keep running your mouth  
You want the recipe but can't handle my sound  
My sound my sound  
No matter what you do I'm gonna get it without ya  
I know you ain't used to a female Alpha  
No matter what you do I'm gonna get it without ya  
I know you ain't used to a female Alpha  
Can't beat a Rolling Stone if you live in a glass house  
You keep on talking that talk one day you're gonna blast out  
You can't be bitter if I'm out here showing my face  
You want what now looks like  
Let me give you a taste  
I know you're dying trying to figure me out  
My name's on the tip of your tongue keep running your mouth  
You want the recipe but can't handle my sound  
My sound my sound  
No matter what you do I'm gonna get it without ya  
I know you ain't used to a female Alpha  
No matter what you do I'm gonna get it without ya  
I know you ain't used to a female Alpha  
You can't get with this if you ain't built for this  
You can't get with this if you ain't built for this  
I can't build you up if you ain't tough enough  
I can't teach a man how to wear his pants haha  
I know you're dying trying to figure me out  
My name's on the tip of your tongue keep running your mouth  
You want the recipe but can't handle my sound  
My sound my sound  
I know you're dying trying to figure me out  
My name's on the tip of your tongue  
Keep running your mouth  
You want the recipe but can't handle my sound  
My sound my sound  
My sound my sound my sound
