### Sofia歌词：

I think we could do it if we tried  
If only to say you're mine  
Sofia know that you and I  
Shouldn't feel like a crime  
I think we could do it if we tried  
If only to say you're mine  
Sofia know that you and I  
Shouldn't feel like a crime  
You know  
I'll do anything you ask me to  
But oh my god  
I think I'm in love with you  
Standing here alone now  
Think that we can drive around  
I just want to say  
How I love you with your hair down  
Baby you don't got to fight  
I'll be here till the end of time  
Wishing that you were mine  
Pull you in it's alright  
I think we could do it if we tried  
If only to say you're mine  
Sofia know that you and I  
Shouldn't feel like a crime  
Honey I don't want it to fade  
There's things that I know could get in the way  
I don't want to say goodbye  
I think that we could do it if we tried  
I think we could do it if we tried  
If only to say you're mine  
Sofia know that you and I  
Shouldn't feel like a crime  
I think we could do it if we tried  
I think we could do it if we tried  
Sofia know that you and I  
Shouldn't feel like a crime  
Sofia know that you and I  
Shouldn't feel like a crime
