### Buzzcut Season歌词：

I remember when your head caught flame  
It kissed your scalp and caressed your brain  
(I remember when your head caught flame)  
Well, you laughed, baby it's okay  
It's buzzcut season anyway  
(Well, you laughed, baby it's okay)  
Explosions on TV  
And all the girls with  
Heads inside a dream  
So now we'll  
Live beside the pool  
Where everything is good

We ride the bus with our knees pulled in  
People should see how we're living  
(We ride the bus with our knees pulled in)  
Shut my eyes to the song that plays  
Sometimes this has a hard, sweet taste  
(Shut my eyes to the song that plays)  
The men upon the news  
They try to tell us all  
That we will lose  
But it's so  
Easy in this blue  
Where everything is good

and I'll never go home again  
(Place the call, feel it start)  
Favorite friend  
And nothings wrong but nothings true  
I'll live in a hologram with you  
Where all the things that we do for fun  
(And I'll breathe, let it go)  
Play along  
And make believe it's never real

I'll live in a hologram with you  
Cold with a burnt out taste  
I'm the one you tell your fears to  
And that will never be enough for us  
Explosions on TV  
And all the girls with  
Heads inside a dream  
So now we'll  
Live beside the pool  
Where everything is good

and I'll never go home again  
(Place the call, feel it start)  
Favorite friend  
And nothings wrong but nothings true  
I'll live in a hologram with you  
Where all the things that we do for fun  
(And I'll breathe, let it go)  
Play along  
And make believe it's never real  
I'll live in a hologram with you
