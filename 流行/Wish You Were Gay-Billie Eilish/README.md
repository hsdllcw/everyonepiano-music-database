**Wish You Were Gay双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Wish You Were Gay_ 是美国年轻唱作歌手Billie Eilish的歌曲。凭着一副厌世模样，加上怪异的风格，深受大家的爱戴。

而单曲《Wish You Were
Gay》，也说中了不少的女生心声。这首歌依字面解释，你会以为是Billie要出柜了，结果却不然！相反，这是一首另类情歌。歌中的意境大致讲述Billie向心仪的男生表白后，他对他不瞅不睬。于是女生心裡觉得，这个男生喜欢的应该是同性吧。

### Wish You Were Gay歌词：

Baby I don't feel so good  
Six words you never understood  
I'll never let you go  
Five words you never say  
Aww  
I laugh alone like nothing's wrong  
Four days has never felt so long  
If three's a crowd and two was us  
One slipped away  
Hahahahahahahaha  
I just wanna make you feel okay  
But all you do is look the other way  
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay  
I just kinda wish you were gay  
Is there a reason we're not through  
Is there a 12 step just for you  
Our conversation's all in blue  
11 "heys"  
Hey hey hey hey  
Ten fingers tearing out my hair  
Nine times you never made it there  
I ate alone at 7 you were six minutes away  
Yay  
How am I supposed to make you feel okay  
When all you do is walk the other way  
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay  
I just kinda wish you were gay  
To spare my pride  
To give your lack of interest an explanation  
Don't say I'm not your type  
Just say that I'm not your preferred sexual orientation  
I'm so selfish  
But you make me feel helpless yeah  
And I can't stand another day  
Stand another day  
I just wanna make you feel okay  
But all you do is look the other way  
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay  
I just kinda wish you were gay  
I just kinda wish you were gay  
I just kinda wish you were gay
