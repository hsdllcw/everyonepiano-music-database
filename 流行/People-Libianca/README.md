### People歌词：

Uhhh mmm mmm  
From Bamenda it's  
Libianca  
Ohhh  
I've been drinking more alcohol for the past five days  
Did you check on me  
Now did you look for me  
I walked in the room eyes are red  
And I don't smoke banga  
Did you check on me  
Now did you notice me  
Nobody will know the paranoia oh  
'Cause I put a smile on my face  
A facade you can never face  
And if you don't know me well well oh  
You won't see how buried I am inside my grave  
Inside my grave  
'Cause you see people  
People  
People  
People don't really know you  
They don't really know you  
'Cause you see people  
People  
People  
They don't really know you  
They don't really know  
I've been drinking more alcohol for the past five days  
Did you check on me  
Now did you look for me  
I walked in the room  
Eyes are red  
And I don't smoke banga  
Did you check on me  
Did you check on me  
Now did you notice me  
Oh holy father  
Oh holy father I did try fo hold my head

I've been drinking more alcohol for the past five days  
Did you check on me  
Now did you look for me

Eyes are red  
And I don't smoke banga  
Did you check on me

Now did you notice me  
I've been drinking more alcohol for the past five days  
Did you check on me

I walked in the room  
Eyes are red  
And I don't smoke banga  
Did you check on me  
Did you check on me  
Now did you notice me  
I've been drinking more alcohol for the past five days  
Did you check on me
