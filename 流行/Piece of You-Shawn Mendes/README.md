### Piece of You歌词：

Yeah, it makes me wanna cry  
Don't know what to do  
It's so hard, but it's true  
Everybody wants a piece  
I get reckless, I'm obsessive  
I'm pathetic and possessive  
You're so sure it makes me insecure  
You're majestic, mesmerizing  
Light the room up without tryin'  
Baby, I'm so into you, it hurts  
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, it just isn't fair  
What you put in the air  
I don't wanna share  
Everybody wants a piece of you  
I get jealous, but who wouldn't when you look like you do  
From the second you walk in the room  
My night is ruined  
Everybody wants a piece  
One, two, three  
So do I, maybe I'm selfish  
Just one touch is so electric  
Every little thing you do feels right, yeah  
I'm sorry if I get protective  
Need these boys to get the message  
You know I'm yours, I know you're mine  
Everybody wants a piece of you  
I get jealous, but who wouldn't when you look like you do  
From the second you walk in the room  
My night is ruined  
Everybody wants a piece  
It's so hard, but it's true  
It's so hard, but it's true  
Everybody wants a piece  
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, it just isn't fair  
What you put in the air  
I don't wanna share  
Everybody wants a piece of you, they all want a piece  
I get jealous, but who wouldn't when you look like you do  
From the second you walk in the room  
My night is ruined  
Everybody wants a piece
