### Boyfriend歌词：

I've been looking for somebody  
Tryna kick it with somebody  
I need a rude boy to tell me something sweet  
Same time got his hands up on my body  
I wanna get high when he take it low low  
Make me feel strong when I'm taking control  
I've been looking for my shawty  
So come and get it if you got it  
All my girls round the world I know you know what I mean  
I get little sexy when I'm lonely  
One thing on my mind I know what I need  
All my girls round the world hands up and sing it with me  
Coz everything I got you know it's all me  
Even though a man ain't something I need  
I wanna boyfriend so put it on me  
I'm looking for a man who can take that heat  
Wanna boyfriend but not too sweet  
My baby gotta be tough while he running that street  
Is he ride or die  
I've been looking so long for a guy to turn me on  
I want a boyfriend yeh yeh  
I want a boyfriend yeh  
I be looking like  
Where you at where you at  
Where you at where you at  
Where you at where you at  
Where you at where you at  
I need you and me together  
I ain't looking for forever  
I had so much stress from my ex to the next  
Want you better love me better  
I need a bad boy that don't bring me drama  
He ain't tryna roll when he get the nah nah  
Boy you ready for the pleasure  
And don't you know its now or never  
All my girls round the world I know you know what I mean  
I get little sexy when I'm lonely  
One thing on my mind I know what I need  
All my girls round the world  
Hands up and sing it with me  
Coz everything I got you know it's all me  
Even though a man ain't something I need  
I wanna boyfriend so put it on me  
I'm looking for a man who can take that heat  
Wanna boyfriend but not too sweet  
My baby gotta be tough while he running that street  
Is he ride or die  
I've been looking so long for a guy to turn me on  
I want a boyfriend yeh yeh  
I want a boyfriend yeh  
I be looking like  
Where you at where you at  
Where you at where you at  
Where you at where you at  
Where you at where you at  
All my girls round the world I know you know what I mean  
I get little sexy when I'm lonely  
One thing on my mind I know what I need  
All my girls round the world  
Hands up and sing it with me  
Coz everything I got you know it's all me  
Even though a man ain't something I need  
I wanna boyfriend so put it on me  
I'm looking for a man who can take that heat  
Wanna boyfriend but not too sweet  
My baby gotta be tough while he running that street  
Is he ride or die  
I've been looking so long for a guy to turn me on
