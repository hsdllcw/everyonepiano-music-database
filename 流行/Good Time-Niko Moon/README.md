### Good Time歌词：

We just tryna catch a good time  
Even if it takes all night  
Pass that bottle 'round the campfire  
Sippin' apple pie moonshine  
Yeah we pickin' on them guitars just right  
Everybody singin' Dixieland Delight  
Like a bobber on a wet line  
We just tryna catch a good time  
Eighty degrees and the sun ain't even out  
We got a spot a couple miles outta town  
When that moon comes up you know what's goin' down  
We got them foldin' chairs leanin way back  
No other plans other than relax  
We ain't worried 'bout tomorrow from where we at  
We just tryna catch a good time  
Even if it takes all night  
Pass that bottle 'round the campfire  
Sippin' apple pie moonshine  
Yeah we pickin' on them guitars just right  
Everybody singing Dixieland Delight  
Like a bobber on a wet line  
We just tryna catch a good time  
Way down here we all got that Southern drawl  
Take our time when we talkin' hey Y'all  
Yeah it don't take much for us to have it all  
That's right  
Something 'bout a night this clear  
Makes your problems disappear  
We just gonna stay right here and let the world go by  
We just tryna catch a good time  
Even if it takes all night  
Pass that bottle 'round the campfire  
Sippin' apple pie moonshine  
Yeah we pickin' on them guitars just right  
Everybody singing Dixieland Delight  
Like a bobber on a wet line  
We just tryna catch a good time  
Something 'bout a night this clear  
Makes your problems disappear  
So we just gonna stay right here and let the world go by  
We just tryna catch a good time  
Even if it takes all night all night  
Pass that bottle 'round the campfire  
Sippin' apple pie moonshine sippin' apple pie moonshine  
Yeah we pickin' on them guitars just right  
Everybody singing Dixieland Delight  
Like a bobber on a wet line  
We just tryna catch a good time  
Good time  
Tryna catch a good time  
Good time  
Good time  
Tryna catch a good time  
Good time  
Yeah we try to catch a good time  
Good time  
Good time  
Good time  
Tryna catch a good time  
Good time baby  
Good time  
Aw I think I got a bite
