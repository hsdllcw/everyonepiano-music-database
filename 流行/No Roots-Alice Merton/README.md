### No Roots歌词：

I like digging holes and hiding things inside them  
When I grow all the hope I won't forgot to find them  
Cause I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night  
I build a home and wait for someone to tear it down  
Then pack it up in boxes head for the next time around  
Cause I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night  
And a thousand times I've seen this road  
A thousand times  
I've got no roots  
But my home was never on the ground  
I've got no roots  
But my home was never on the ground  
I've got no roots  
I've got no roots  
I've got no roots  
But my home was never on the ground  
I've got no roots  
But my home was never on the ground  
I've got no roots  
I've got no roots  
I like standing still but that's just a wishful plan  
Ask me where I come from I'll say a different land  
But I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night  
I count gates and numbers then play the guessing game  
It's just the place that changes the rest is still the same  
But I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night  
And a thousand times I've seen this road  
A thousand times  
I've got no roots  
But my home was never on the ground  
I've got no roots  
But my home was never on the ground  
I've got no roots  
I've got no roots  
I've got no roots  
But my home was never on the ground  
I've got no roots  
But my home was never on the ground  
I've got no roots  
I've got no roots  
I like digging holes hiding things inside them  
When I grow old I won't forget to find them  
I like digging holes hiding things inside them  
When I grow old I won't forget to find them  
I've got no roots  
No roots  
I've got no roots  
But my home was never on the ground  
I've got no roots  
But my home was never on the ground  
I've got no roots  
I've got no roots  
I've got no roots  
But my home was never on the ground  
I've got no roots  
But my home was never on the ground  
I've got no roots  
I've got no roots  
No
