### Good Girls歌词：

Do do do d-do do do do do do

She's a good girl  
She's Daddy's favorite  
He's saved for Harvard  
He know she'll make it  
She's good at school  
She's never truant  
She can speak French  
(I think she's fluent)

'Cause every night she studies hard in her room  
At least that's what her parents assume  
But she sneaks out the window to meet with her boyfriend  
Here's what she told me the time that I caught her

She said to me,  
"Forget what you thought  
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught.  
So just turn around and forget what you saw  
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught."

Whoa oh oh oh- oh whoa oh  
Good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught  
Whoa oh oh oh- oh whoa oh  
Good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught

She's a good girl  
A straight A student  
She's really into  
All that self-improvement  
I swear she lives in that library  
But if you ask her she'll say,  
"That's where you'll find me!"

But if you look then you won't find her there  
She may be clever but she just acts too square  
'Cause in the back of the room where nobody looks  
She'll be with her boyfriend  
She's not reading books!

She said to me,  
"Forget what you thought  
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught.  
So just turn around and forget what you saw  
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught."

Do do do d-do do do do do do  
Good girls are bad girls and good girls are bad girls  
Do do do d-do do do do do do  
Good girls are bad girls and good girls are bad girls

She's a good girl  
(She's a good girl)  
Hasn't been caught  
(She's a good girl)  
She's a good girl  
(She's a good girl)  
Hasn't been caught... caught... caught... caught... caught... caught...
caught... caught...

She said to me,  
"Forget what you thought  
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught.  
So just turn around and forget what you saw  
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught."

She said to me,  
(She said to me)  
"Forget what you thought  
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught.  
So just turn around  
(Just turn around)  
And forget what you saw  
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught."

Whoa oh oh oh-oh whoa oh  
Good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught  
Whoa oh oh oh-oh whoa oh  
Good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught  
Whoa oh oh oh- oh whoa oh  
Whoa oh oh- oh oh whoa oh  
Good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught
