### Heartless歌词：

Heartless  
So heartless  
Say you goin' out late  
I count down till you call me  
It's just one of those things  
That you do when you're lonely  
And you're all about the chase  
But you won't ever let me catch you  
And I wish I was the same  
But I know I'm gonna let you  
Win again and when I do  
It's gonna hurt like hell  
And you don't mean to  
That's what I tell myself  
But why you gotta be so heartless  
I know you think it's harmless  
You're tearing me apart and  
Girl the hardest part is  
You're so high on attention  
You're taking miles for inches  
Leave me in the darkness  
Never finish what we started  
Girl why you gotta be so heartless  
Why you gotta be so heartless  
Monday night was definitely not our night  
Tuesday night was just another fight  
Wednesday I thought everything would change  
Thursday came and it was still the same  
Friday night we went out on the town  
Saturday we should have burned it down  
Sunday morning came and now you're gone  
I should prolly know this s**t by now  
Ah oh  
I should prolly know this s**t by now  
But no no  
Why you gotta be so heartless  
I know you think it's harmless  
You're tearing me apart and  
Girl the hardest part is  
You're so high on attention  
You're taking miles for inches  
Leave me in the darkness  
Never finish what we started  
Girl why you gotta be so heartless  
Why you gotta be so heartless  
Girl why you gotta be so in between  
Loving me and leaving leaving  
Ah oh  
I should prolly know this s**t by now  
But no no  
Why you gotta be so heartless  
I know you think it's harmless  
You're tearing me apart and  
Girl the hardest part is  
You're so high on attention  
You're taking miles for inches  
Leave me in the darkness  
Never finish what we started  
Girl why you gotta be so heartless  
Why you gotta be so heartless  
Why you gotta be so heartless  
Girl why you gotta be so heartless
