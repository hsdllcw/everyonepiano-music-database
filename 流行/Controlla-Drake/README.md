### Dark Necessities歌词：

[Verse 1: Drake]  
Right, my yiy just changed  
You just buzzed the front gate  
I thank God you came  
How many more days could I wait?  
I made plans with you  
And I won't let em fall through  
I, I, I, I, I

[Hook: Drake]  
I think I'd lie for you  
I think I'd die for you  
Jodeci "Cry For You"  
Do things when you want me to  
Like controlla, controlla  
Yeah, like controlla, controlla  
[Verse 2: Drake]  
Yeah, okay, you like it  
When I get, aggressive, tell you to  
Go slower, go faster  
Like controlla, controlla  
Yeah, like controlla, controlla

[Bridge: Drake]  
And I’m never on a waste ting shorty  
I do it how you say you want it  
Them girls, they just wanna take my money  
They don't want me to give you nothing  
They don't want you to have nothing  
They don't wanna see me find your lovin'  
They don't wanna see me  
Smiling back when they pree

[Hook: Drake]  
Knowing I'd lie for you  
Thinking I'd die for you  
Jodeci "Cry For You"  
Do things when you want me to  
Like controlla, controlla  
Yeah, like controlla, controlla

[Verse 3: Beenie Man]  
Gyal a tear off mi garments  
And a bawl fi come inna mi apartment (Woi!)  
Di gyal dem want di length and strength  
Action speak louder than argument well

[Verse 4: Drake]  
But you can't just diss and come tell man sorry  
You can't listen to me talk and go tell my story  
Nah, it don't work like that when you love somebody  
My old flex is my new flex now and we're workin' on it  
And that's why I need all the energy that you bring to me  
My last girl would tear me apart, but she'd never wanna split a ting with me  
But when it comes to you, you

[Hook: Drake]  
I think I'd lie for you  
I think I'd die for you  
Do things when you want me too  
Like controlla, controlla  
Yeah, like controlla, controlla

[Bridge: Drake]  
And I’m never on a waste ting shorty  
I do it how you say you want it  
Them girls, they just wanna take my money  
They don't want me to give you nothing  
They don't want you to have nothing  
They don't wanna see me find your lovin'  
They don't wanna see me  
Smiling back when they pree  
Jheeze!

[Outro: Beenie Man]  
Music a drop  
Gyal a whine up dem bumpa  
Dis is di summa summa controlla  
Drake from Canada, Beenie Man from Jamaica  
Dah one yah a murda!  
Zagga
