### Going Bad歌词：

Drake/Future：  
Yeah  
Wheezy outta here  
Jeez jeez  
Drake：  
Back home smokin' legal  
Legal  
I got more slaps than The Beatles  
Beatles  
Foreign s**t runnin' on diesel dawg  
Playin' with my name that s**t is lethal dawg  
Who you say you was  
Don Corleone  
Trust me at the top it isn't lonely  
Strapped  
Everybody actin' like they know me dawg  
Don't just say you're down you gotta show me  
What you gotta do  
Bring the clip back empty  
It's empty  
You asked to see the boss so they sent me dawg  
Sent me dawg  
I just broke her off with a 10-piece dawg  
10-piece dawg  
That ain't nothin' I'm just bein' friendly dawg  
Drake：  
It's just a lil' 10-piece for her  
Just to blow it in the mall doesn't mean that we're involved  
I just what I just uh put a Richard on the card  
I ain't grow up playin' ball but  
I'll show you how the f**k you gotta do it  
If you really wanna ball 'til you fall  
When your back against the wall  
And a bunch of n***as need you to go away  
Still goin' bad on 'em anyway  
Saw you last night but did it broad day  
Drake：  
Yeah lot of Murakami in the hallway  
What  
Got a sticky and I keep it at my dawg's place  
Girl I left your love at Magic now it's all shade  
Still goin' bad on you anyway  
Meek Mill：  
Woah woah ooh woah  
Woah woah ah  
I could fit like 80 racks in my Amiris  
80 racks  
Me and Drizzy back-to-back it's gettin' scary  
Back-to-back  
If you f**kin' with my opps just don't come near me  
Get outta my way  
Put some bands all on your head like Jason Terry  
Brrt brrt ooh  
Richard Mille cost a Lambo  
That's a Lambo  
Known to keep the baddest B*****s on commando  
Salute  
Every time I'm in my trap I move like Rambo  
Extended  
Ain't a neighborhood in Philly that I can't go  
That's a Fendi  
For real  
She said Oh you rich rich  
You rich rich  
B***h I graduated call me  
Big Fish  
Marlin  
I got Lori Harvey on my wish list  
That's Lori  
That's the only thing I want for Christmas  
True story uh  
I've been had my way out here yeah know that's facts  
Facts  
You ain't livin' that s**t you say yeah we know that's cap  
That's cap  
You ain't got to ask me when you see me know I'm strapped  
Brrt  
DC OVO we back again we goin' plat'  
Ooh ooh  
Drake：  
It's just a lil' 10-piece for her  
Just to blow it in the mall doesn't mean that we're involved  
I just what I just uh put a Richard on the card  
I ain't grow up playin' ball but  
I'll show you how the f**k you gotta do it  
If you really wanna ball 'til you fall  
When your back against the wall  
And a bunch of n***as need you to go away  
Still goin' bad on 'em anyway  
Saw you last night but did it broad day  
Future：  
Wheezy outta here
