### Victorious歌词：

Tonight we are victorious  
Champagne pouring over us  
All my friends were glorious  
Tonight we are victorious

Oh-oh-oh,  
Victorious  
Oh-oh-oh

Double bubble disco queen headed to the guillotine  
Skin as cool as Steve McQueen, let me be your killer king  
It hurts until it stops, we will love until it’s not  
I’m a killing spree in white, eyes like broken Christmas lights

My touch is black and poisonous  
And nothing like my punch-drunk kiss  
I know you need it, do you feel it  
Drink the water, drink the wine

Oh we gotta turn up the crazy  
Livin’ like a washed-up celebrity  
Shooting fireworks like it’s the Fourth of July  
Until we feel alright  
Until we feel alright

I’m like a scarf trick, it’s all up the sleeve  
I taste like magic, waves that swallow quick and deep  
Throw the bait, catch the shark, bleed the water red  
Fifty words for murder and I’m every one of them

My touch is black and poisonous  
And nothing like my punch-drunk kiss  
I know you need it, do you feel it  
Drink the water, drink the wine

Oh we gotta turn up the crazy  
Livin’ like a washed-up celebrity  
Shooting fireworks like it’s the Fourth of July

Tonight we are victorious  
Champagne pouring over us  
All my friends were glorious  
Tonight we are victorious

Tonight we are victorious  
Champagne pouring over us  
All my friends were glorious  
Tonight we are victorious

Oh we gotta turn up the crazy  
Livin’ like a washed-up celebrity  
Shooting fireworks like it’s the Fourth of July  
Until we feel alright  
Until we feel alright

Tonight we are victorious  
Champagne pouring over us  
All my friends were glorious  
Tonight we are victorious
