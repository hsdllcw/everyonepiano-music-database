### The Life歌词：

Yeah yeah  
Ever since I was young I'm tryna get it right  
Every year I'm working towards the gold  
Don't sleep 'til we see the daylight  
Living big going up on the rope  
I like seeing all the bright lights  
Keep it up pour it up for the night  
Two times I'mma get it two times  
Double up run it back on my mind  
This is the life life life  
This is the life life life  
This is the life life life  
This is the life  
This is the life  
This is the life life life  
This is the life  
This is the life  
This is the life life life  
This is the life  
This is the life  
Give it up for the kids  
Eating good getting lit  
Living life feeling rich  
Oh I Oh I this is the life  
We the best in the biz  
Breaking up ain't a chance  
Living life feeling rich  
Oh I Oh I yeah  
Level up meet me court side  
Tricking out whipping hard in the coupe  
I'mma go gotta board flight  
Of the term there's a show I gotta do  
No stress baby you can find us  
Getting down on a beach in Dubai  
Pool side sipping on a Mai Tai  
Double up run it back on my mind  
This is the life life life  
This is the life life life  
This is the life life life  
This is the life  
This is the life  
This is the life life life  
This is the life  
This is the life  
This is the life life life  
This is the life  
This is the life  
Give it up for the kids  
Eating good getting lit  
Living life feeling rich  
Oh I Oh I this is the life  
We the best in the biz  
Breaking up ain't a chance  
Living life feeling rich  
Oh I Oh I yeah  
No stress baby you can find us  
Getting down on a beach in Dubai  
Pool side sipping on a Mai Tai  
Double up up up up  
This is the life  
This is the life life life  
This is the life life life  
This is the life  
This is the life life life  
This is the life  
This is the life life life  
This is the life  
This is the life life life  
This is the life  
This is the life  
Give it up for the kids  
Eating good getting lit  
Living life feeling rich  
Oh I Oh I this is the life  
We the best in the biz  
Breaking up ain't a chance  
Living life feeling rich  
Oh I Oh I yeah  
This is the life
