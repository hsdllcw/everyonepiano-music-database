### Lemon歌词：

The truth will set you free  
But first it'll piss you off  
Hate bad b**ches wanna be my bae  
Hate hunt me down like the C.I.A  
Hate side of my car tryna see my face  
Hate want me to beat it like the T.I. case  
Oh hate and if it's heated I'ma feed my face  
Hate and best believe it's gon' be outrageous  
Hate hatin' niggas can't believe my race  
Hate niggas hit you with the eli face oh  
Bouncin' around bouncin' around bouncin'  
Bouncin' around bouncin' around bouncin'  
Scrunchin' their eyes with your name in their mouth and  
Bouncin' around bouncin' around bouncin'  
Hate you keep askin' me where I'm from  
Hate about the borders and did I run  
Hate keep askin' how I feel 'bout guns  
Hate there's a light and dark army which side you choose oh  
Hate if not now then when  
Hate and if not me then who  
Hate don't drink the Kool Aid my friends  
Hate I tried to tell y'all about this dude  
Bouncin' around bouncin' around bouncin'  
Bouncin' around bouncin' around bouncin'  
Hate supplements are found right in their couches  
Bouncin' around bouncin' around bouncin'  
Wait wait a minute  
Shout out to them people people  
People people people  
Wait wait a minute  
Mad ethnic right now  
I get it how I live it  
I live it how I get  
Count the mothaf**kin' digits  
I pull up with a lemon  
Not 'cause she ain't livin'  
It's just your eyes get acidic  
And this here ain't a scrimmage  
Mothaf**ka we ain't finished  
I told you we won't stop  
A ni**a 'bouta business  
Like yours but you rent it  
Wave hello to the top  
Ni**a the Veyron glide  
Tell the paparazzi get the lens right  
Got the window down top blowin' la  
Got the hazards on only doin' five  
You can catch me Rih in the new La Ferrar'  
And the truck behind me got arms  
Yeah longer than LeBron  
Just waitin' for my thumb like the fonz  
Woo this beat tastes like lunch  
But it's runnin' from veneers and it's runnin' from the fronts  
But everyday hey wasn't lemonade  
I was afraid once a ni**a graduate  
Would I be okay  
So I prayed and I played  
It's Rihanna ni**a  
My constellation in space  
Warp speed Doctor Spock couldn't chase ni**a  
Ni**a bath salt bitin' speakers in the face  
Bath salt bitin' speakers in the face  
Bath bath salt bitin' speakers in the face  
Bath bath salt bitin' speakers in the face  
Bath bath salt bitin' speakers in the face  
Bath bath salt bitin' speakers in the face  
Bath bath salt bitin' speakers in the face  
Bath bath salt bitin' speakers in the face  
Bath bath salt bitin' speakers in the face  
I get it how I live it  
I live it how I get  
Count the mothaf**kin' digits  
I pull up with a lemon  
Not 'cause she ain't livin'  
It's just your eyes get acidic  
And this here ain't a scrimmage  
Mothaf**ka we ain't finished  
I told you we won't stop  
A ni**a 'bouta business  
Like yours but you rent it  
Wave hello to the top  
Ni**a the Veyron glide  
Tell the paparazzi get the lens right  
Got the window down top blowin' la  
Got the hazards on only doin' five  
You can catch me  
Bouncin' around bouncin' around bouncin'  
You can catch me  
Wait wait a minute  
Wait wait a minute  
Wait wait a minute  
Wait wait a minute  
Wait wait a minute  
Wait wait a minute  
Wait wait a minute  
Wait wait a minute
