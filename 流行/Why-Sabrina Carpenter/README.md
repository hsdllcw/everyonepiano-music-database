### Why歌词：

You like New York city in the daytime  
I like New York city in the nighttime  
You say you like sleeping with the air off  
I don't  
I need it on  
You like the light coming through the windows  
I sleep late so I just keep em all closed  
You ignore the music on the radio  
I don't  
I sing-a-long  
I don't ask for you to change baby no no no  
And you don't ask for me to change  
Tell me how we're not alike  
But we work so well  
And we don't even know why  
Funny how the stars crossed right  
Cause we work so well  
And we don't even know why  
You can call it fire and ice  
But we work so well  
And we don't even know why  
We don't even know why no no  
We don't even know why no no no  
No no no no  
No no no no  
Cold outside and you're just in a T-shirt  
I have cold blood even in a sweater  
You start your night sippin' by the kilo  
I don't  
I know you know  
I don't ask for you to change baby no no no  
And you don't ask for me to change  
Tell me how we're not alike  
But we work so well  
And we don't even know why  
Funny how the stars crossed right  
Cause we work so well  
And we don't even know why  
You can call it fire and ice  
But we work so well  
And we don't even know why  
We don't even know why no no  
We don't even know why no no no  
No no no no  
We don't even know  
We don't even know  
We don't even know know know know know know know know know know  
Somehow we end up on the same side  
And you wouldn't think that we'd be alright  
Even our eyes are different colours  
But we see fine  
Somehow we end up on the same side  
And you wouldn't think that we'd be alright  
Even our eyes are different colours  
But we see fine  
Tell me how we're not alike  
But we work so well  
And we don't even know why  
Funny how the stars crossed right  
Cause we work so well  
But we don't even know why  
You can call it fire and ice  
Cause we work so well  
And we don't even know why  
We don't even know why no no  
We don't even know why no no no  
No no no no  
No no no no
