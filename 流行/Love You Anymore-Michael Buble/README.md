### Love You Anymore歌词：

Just because I wander 'round the places we would go  
Hoping that I'd run into you one last time  
Just because I never took your picture off my phone  
Doesn't mean that you're still on my mind  
Just because I accidentally slipped and said your name  
Well I heard your song it makes me insecure  
Just because I know I'll never ever feel the same  
Doesn't mean I love you anymore  
Am I lying to myself again  
When I say you're not the best I've ever had  
Am I lying to myself again  
When I say that I'm not missing you so bad  
Just because I'm on my knees and swearing I would change  
And I'd do anything to hear you say "I'm yours"  
Just because I know I'll never ever feel the same  
Doesn't mean I love you anymore  
Am I lying to myself again  
When I say you're not the best I've ever had  
Am I lying to myself again  
When I say that I'm not missing you so bad  
Just because I'm on my knees and swearing I would change  
And do anything to hear you say "I'm yours"  
Just because I know I'll never ever feel the same  
Doesn't mean I love you anymore more  
Doesn't mean I love you anymore anymore anymore  
Doesn't mean I love you anymore
