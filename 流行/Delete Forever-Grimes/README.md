**Delete Forever双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Delete Forever_ 是加拿大另类电子女声Grimes的新单。发行于2020年2月12日。且此曲收录在其第五张录音室专辑Miss
Anthropocene中。Grimes用一种精神错乱式的风格来创作，她说自己是乐团，不是个人，听完她的首张个人专辑，你不免陷入深思，这种“人机合体”的嗓音，与冷冽神经质的诠释，的确深具某种难以言喻的华丽艺术魅力，从她脑中转换出来的音符与节奏，繁琐且堆迭的合成电子编曲，像是一股脑的破碎与焦虑，凄美得让人不舍。

### Delete Forever歌词：

Lying so awake things I can't escape  
Lately I just turn 'em into demons  
Flew into the sun f**king heroin  
Lately I just turn 'em into reasons  
But it refuses  
Always down I'm not up  
Guess it's just my rotten luck  
To fill my time with permanent blue  
But I can't see above it guess I f**king love it  
But oh I didn't mean too  
I see everything I see everything  
Don't you tell me now that I don't want it  
But I did everything I did everything  
More lines on the mirror than a sonnet  
Woo  
Funny how they think us naive when we're on the brink  
Innocence was fleeting like a season  
Cannot comprehend lost so many men  
Lately all their ghosts turn into reasons and excuses  
Always down I'm not up  
Guess it's just my rotten luck  
To fill my time with permanent blue  
But I can't see above it  
Guess I f**king love it  
But oh I didn't mean too  
I see everything I see everything  
Don't you tell me now that I don't want it  
But I did everything I did everything  
More lines on the mirror than a sonnet  
Woo  
I see everything I see everything  
Don't you tell me now that I don't want it  
But I did everything I did everything  
More lines on the mirror than a sonnet
