### Formidable歌词：

You are formidable to me  
'Cause you seem to know it where you wanna go  
Yeah yeah yeah I'll follow you  
But you should know I might be cynical towards you  
But I just can't believe that I'm for you  
Yeah yeah yeah I can die with you  
Just let me know  
And I know that we just met  
But could you take me everywhere you've ever been  
I wanna see it all no surprises  
Yeah  
You are formidable to me  
'Cause you seem to know it where you wanna go  
Yeah yeah yeah I'll follow you  
But you should know I might be clinical don't you tell  
I won't break your heart if you can break my spell  
Yeah yeah yeah I can die with you  
Just let me know  
Fast-forward thirteen years now  
Don't know what it was but somehow we played it out in reverse  
I'm afraid of you now more than I was at first  
And I know you just left  
But can I take you everywhere we've ever been  
I wanna see it all no surprises  
Yeah  
You are formidable to me  
'Cause you seem to know it where you wanna go  
Yeah yeah yeah I'll follow you  
But you should know  
I might be cynical towards you  
I'm just worried my loyalty will bore you  
Yeah yeah yeah  
I can die with you  
Just let me know  
Yeah yeah yeah  
I can die with you  
Just let me know
