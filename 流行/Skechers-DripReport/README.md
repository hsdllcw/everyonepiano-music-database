### Skechers歌词：

I tried to stop, but I can't stop  
I just can't stop thinking about her  
I don't know, all I remember was she wear the Skechers  
The light-up ones  
Shawty bad with the Skechers on  
Wanna hold your hand, make you my girl  
Light-up, light-up Skechers  
Light up, light up my world  
Shawty bad with the Skechers on  
Wanna hold your hand, make you my girl  
Light-up, light-up Skechers  
Light up, light up my world  
I like your Skechers, you like me, my Gucci shoes  
I'll buy you the purse, only if you show me your boobs  
I like your Skecher, you like me too  
Bring your friends, all of us in the pool  
Bad lil' b!tch, all my drip make her drool  
Brand new whip, come and sit in the coupe (Hm)  
I just wanna make you mine, hop inside the ride  
Nina by my side, promise you it all be fine  
I-I just wanna make you mine, hop inside the ride  
Nina by my side, promise it's gon' be alright  
Shawty bad with the Skechers on  
Wanna hold your hand, make you my girl  
Light-up, light-up Skechers  
Light up, light up my world  
Shawty bad with the Skechers on  
Wanna hold your hand, make you my girl  
Light-up, light-up Skechers  
Light up, light up my world
