**I Can't Make You Love Me** 是美国独立民谣歌手/作曲家Justin
Vernon最近所创立的团名以及他到目前为止最受人注目的计划之一Bon Iver的一首翻唱歌曲。有许多人会以为Bon Iver就是Justin
Vernon的艺名，其实不然，这是一个团名。而Bon Iver现在也包含了Mike Noyce和Sean Carey两名团员。

  
Bon Iver这名字是取自于法文bon hiver的谐音，意思是美好的冬天，而团名也揭露出了该团音乐的性质，静谧寒冷又哀伤。首脑Justin
Vernon在2008年独立发行了Bon Iver乐团首张专辑，For Emma, Forever Ago，大部分的歌都是在Justin
Vernon居住在威斯康辛州的深山独自居住三个月时所录下来的。

### I Can't Make You Love Me歌词：

Turn down the lights,  
turn down the bed,  
turn down these voices,  
inside my head

Lay down with me,  
tell me no lies,  
just hold me close,  
don't patronize me [2x]

Cause I can't make you love me  
if you don't,  
you can't make your heart feel  
something it wont,  
here in the dark,  
these final words  
I will lay down my heart  
and I feel the power  
but you don't,  
no you don't

Cause I can't make you love me,  
if you don't [2x]

I'll close my eyes,  
Then I wont see  
The love you don't feel,  
when you're holding me  
Morning will come,  
and I'll do what's right  
Just give me till then  
To give up this fight  
And I will give up this fight...

Cause I can't make you love me if you don't  
I can't make your heart feel,  
something it wont,  
Here in the dark  
These final words  
I will lay down my heart  
And I feel the power  
but you don't,  
no you don't

I can't make you love me if you don't  
If you don't,  
no you, no you wont

I found love darlin' [5x]  
Love in the nick of time  
I found love darlin' yeah,  
Love in the nick of time
