**To Be Young双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_To Be Young_ 是Anne-Marie安姐惊艳联手流媒Doja
cat豆荚猫合作的全新单曲。用音乐吟唱年轻宣言，安姐一改往日清甜活泼的唱法，选择了空灵悠远的曲调。豆荚猫doja的曲段也是非常自由，不受节奏束缚的说唱。总之，俩人没有延续一如既往的唱法，而是选择去尝试新的voice。副歌部分，如同一层一层的楼梯，每升一次曲调都像迎来新的惊喜。

### To Be Young歌词：

They tell me I should make a plan for life  
All I'm thinking bout is what to do tonight  
Hundred miles an hour no headlights  
On an open road oh  
We do what we can to dull the pain  
Pinky promise things will stay the same  
Even when I'm old I'll know your name  
Anywhere we go oh  
Dye my hair a million colours  
Dream I'll make a billion dollars  
I swear that day can't come soon enough  
In the meantime we just  
Fall in love broken heart  
Break the rules drink too much  
We're all a mess but I guess  
This is what it feels like to be young  
Take a punch get back up  
Act a fool give a f**k  
We're are all a mess but I guess  
This is what it feels like to be young  
Small town and we're drinking all the liquor  
Every night trying to feel something bigger  
Hotboxing the car in the winter  
We don't wanna go home  
And I'll dye my hair a million colours  
Dream I'll make a billion dollars  
I swear that day can't come soon enough  
In the meantime we just  
Fall in love broken heart  
Break the rules drink too much  
We're all a mess but I guess  
This is what it feels like to be young  
Take a punch get back up  
Act a fool give a f**k  
We're all a mess but I guess  
This is what it feels like to be young  
This can't be real life don't even feel high  
Maybe if you'll take one with me then it'll feel right  
Don't want to know what standing still would even feel like  
Wanted to fit in when I didn't now I know  
And I just want freedom can't be lonely  
Heartless hopeful stupid phoney  
Say they love me but won't show me  
Guess this is how it feels like to be young  
Fall in love Broken heart  
Break the rules drink too much  
We're all a mess but I guess  
This is what it feels like to be young  
Take a punch get back up  
Act a fool give a f**k  
We're all a mess but I guess  
This is what it feels like to be young  
Ya oh oh ho ya oh oh ho  
This is what it feels like to be young be young  
This is what it feels like to be young
