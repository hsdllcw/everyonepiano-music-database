### Feel Good歌词：

Yeah, I doubt, I doubt myself  
我时常会怀疑我自己  
And I'm too proud to ask for help  
我心高气傲不愿向你求援  
When you see me beside myself  
当你看到我情绪失控  
I don't have to explain it, baby  
我没必要跟你解释 亲爱的  
Yeah, I'm over picking fights  
我曾犹豫过要不要挑起无谓的争执  
And trying to mend it with the high  
曾试图花高价修补我们脆弱的情感  
Don't wanna know that I'm not right  
不愿相信这样做不对  
I know that I've been lately, lately  
我知道一切为时过晚  
Yeah, sometimes I need someone to pick me up  
有时我需要能带我离开这里的人  
Overdose my mind with the things I love  
我总在所爱的事上花费过多心思  
You can take me there, when my heart beats  
你可以带我去往让我心悸的地方  
When my heart beats free  
心自由跳动的地方  
Take my hand in the middle of a crisis

Pull me close, show me, baby, where the light is  
轻拥我入怀告诉我曙光在哪  
I was scared of a heart I couldn't silence

But you make me, you make me feel good, I like it

Take my hand in the middle of a crisis

When all these problems burn like hell  
我已被压得不堪重负  
Maybe I just need a friend  
也许我只是需要一个朋友  
Who never calls me crazy, crazy  
阻止我变的更加疯狂 疯狂  
You pull me off the front line before I run

Keep me cool, but not get overdone

It's only moments and I'm in heaven
