### Who's in Your Head歌词：

You moved like magic you moved like time  
You had your heart disguised  
When you cry diamonds yeah they shine  
But they blind my eyes and now  
I hear the whispers every night  
Even when I'm dreamin'  
Now tell me baby would you ever mind  
I wanna know who's in your head  
Stealin' your heart while I'm still bleedin'  
Who's in your bed  
Wrapped in your arms while I ain't sleepin'  
Got lost in your halo  
Halo  
I just wanna know  
Know who's in your head in your head  
I wanna know who's in your head in your head  
You moved like danger but I don't mind  
The way you talking' with your eyes  
Your eyes  
You leave me broken and I can't lie  
It gets me every time and now  
I hear the whispers every night  
Even when I'm dreamin'  
Now tell me baby would you ever mind  
I wanna know who's in your head  
Stealin' your heart while I'm still bleedin'  
Who's in your bed  
Wrapped in your arms while I ain't sleepin'  
Got lost in your halo  
Halo  
I just wanna know  
Know who's in your head in your head  
I wanna know who's in your head in your head  
You get me down  
On my knees  
On my knees yeah  
You drive me wild  
When you want  
When you want it  
Oh you get me down  
On my knees  
On my knees yeah  
'Cause every time I look into your eyes  
Look into your eyes  
I wanna know who's in your head  
Stealin' your heart while I'm still bleedin'  
Who's in your bed  
Wrapped in your arms while I ain't sleepin'  
Got lost in your halo  
Halo  
I just wanna know  
Know who's in your head in your head  
I wanna know who's in your head in your head  
In your head still baby  
In your head while you're sleepin'  
In your head still baby  
In your head while you're sleepin'
