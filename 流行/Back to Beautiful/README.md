### Back to Beautiful歌词：

They say  
You're not good enough you're not brave enough  
You should cover up your body  
Tell me watch my weight  
Gotta paint my face  
Or else no one's gonna want me  
Why do we say this to ourselves  
And even worse to each other  
Why do we say this to ourselves ooh  
We gotta get back to beautiful  
Gotta get back to beautiful  
All these wars starting wars  
Over who can hurt who more  
Gotta get back to beautiful  
Get back beautiful  
Get back beautiful  
Get back beautiful  
Get back beautiful  
Judging who we love judging where we're from  
Where we're from  
When did this become so normal  
Celebrating hate is now a commonplace  
Commonplace  
When did this become so normal  
Why do we say this to ourselves  
And even worse to each other  
Why do we say this to ourselves ooh  
Why do we say this to ourselves why  
And even worse to each other ooh  
Why do we say this to ourselves ooh  
We gotta get back to beautiful  
Gotta get back to beautiful come back oh  
All these wars starting wars  
Over who can hurt who more  
Gotta get back to beautiful  
Get back beautiful  
Get back beautiful  
Get back beautiful  
Get back beautiful  
We gotta get back to beautiful  
Gotta get back to beautiful  
All these wars starting wars  
Over who can hurt who more  
Gotta get back to beautiful  
Get back beautiful  
Get back beautiful  
Get back beautiful  
Get back beautiful
