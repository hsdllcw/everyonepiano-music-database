### This Girl歌词：

Money rains from the sky above  
墨绿美钞纷纷扬扬  
But keep the change cuz I've got enough  
小钱留着吧，老娘有的是钱  
A little time and some tenderness  
就算我宽宏大量，再给你点时间  
You'll never buy my love !!  
你也买不到我的爱  
No other thing that's as precious to  
万金难求，不可衡量  
No other ! There's no other !  
想都别想！门都没有！  
And a heart that's real and a heart that's true  
一片赤诚，一片真心  
Somethin' that you've got to love this girl  
这才是你爱女孩的正确方式  
They'll by them...  
他们要么混乱  
Or them over  
要么完蛋  
They'll by them you...  
他们要么混乱  
O-or them over  
要么完蛋  
They'll by them you  
他们要么混乱  
Or them over  
要么完蛋  
They'll by them you  
他们要么混乱  
Or them over  
要么完蛋  
These treasures don't really come for free  
这些奢华宝贝肯定不是白来的  
Your paychecks don't mean that much to me  
你那点工资也好意思在我面前跳  
Just take my hand and hold me tight  
就让你碰碰老娘的玉手，要抓稳了  
You'll never buy my love !  
你可买不到我的爱  
You buy me this and you buy me that  
献殷勤你真是好手  
To win over ! Win me over !  
就为了得到我！得到我！  
You got me wrong and thats a fact  
可你看错我了，大错特错  
Somethin' that you've got to love this...  
是什么让你深深爱着这个女孩，不肯放弃  
Will you realize when I'm gone  
你总会意识到我早已远在天边  
That I dance to a different song  
因为我和着完全不同的曲子跳舞  
Will you realize when I'm gone  
你何时才明白我早就甩掉你了  
That I dance to a different song  
我可从来没跟你同步过  
It's a shame but I've got to go  
虽然有些羞愧，但我还是毅然决然地大步离开  
Woh !  
喔！  
They'll by them...  
他们要么混乱  
Or them over  
要么完蛋  
They'll by them you...  
他们要么混乱  
O-or them over  
要么完蛋  
They'll by them you  
他们要么混乱  
Or them over  
要么完蛋  
They'll by them you  
他们要么混乱  
Or them over  
要么完蛋
