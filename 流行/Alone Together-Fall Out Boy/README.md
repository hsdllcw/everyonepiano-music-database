Alone Together_ 是美国一支流行庞克、另类摇滚曲风的乐团Fall Out Boy的歌曲。Fall Out
Boy组建于2001年，曾获格莱美提名。充满年轻活力朝气，畅快将庞克的不羁气焰完全释放，些许EMO风格夹带流畅声线， Fall Out
Boy虽然和时下偶像团体般，在团名中加入个"Boy"字眼，但是，他们可完全不按牌理出牌，踢爆时下做作男孩偶像团体的面具，给你最热血的新世代之音！

### Alone Together歌词：

I don't know where you're going  
But do you got room for one more troubled soul?  
I don't know where I'm going but I don't think  
I'm coming home  
And I said I'll check in  
Tomorrow if I don't wake up dead  
This is the road to ruin  
And we're starting at the end  
Say yeah (yeah!)  
Let's be alone together (yeah!)  
We could stay young forever (yeah!)  
Scream it from the top of your lungs  
Say yeah (yeah!)  
Let's be alone together (yeah!)  
We could stay young forever (yeah!)  
We'll stay young, young, young, young, young.  
You cut me off, I lost my track  
It's not my fault, I'm a maniac  
It's not funny anymore, no it's not  
My heart is like a stallion  
They love it more when it's broken  
Do you wanna feel beautiful?  
Do you wanna?  
(Yeahh yeh)  
I'm outside the door, invite me in  
So we can go back and play pretend  
I'm on deck, yeah, I'm up next  
Tonight I'm high as a private jet  
'Cause I don't know where you're going  
But do you got room for one more troubled soul  
I don't know where I'm going but I don't think  
I'm coming home  
And I said I'll check in  
Tomorrow if I don't wake up dead  
This is the road to ruin  
And we're starting at the end  
Say yeah (yeah!)  
Let's be alone together (yeah!)  
We could stay young forever (yeah!)  
Scream it from the top of your lungs  
Say yeah (yeah!)  
Let's be alone together (yeah!)  
We could stay young forever (yeah!)  
We'll stay young, young, young, young, young.  
My heart is like a stallion,  
They love it more when it's broken  
Do you wanna feel beautiful?  
Do you wanna?  
(Yeahh yeh)  
I'm outside the door, invite me in  
So we can go back and play pretend  
I'm on deck, yeah, I'm up next  
Tonight I'm high as a private jet, yeah  
(Yeah) let's be alone together (yeah!)  
We could stay young forever (yeah!)  
Scream it from the top of your lungs  
Say yeah (yeah!)  
Let's be alone together (yeah!)  
We could stay young forever (yeah!)  
We'll stay young, young, young, young, young.  
I don't know where you're going  
But do you got room for one more troubled soul  
I don't know where I'm going but I don't think  
I'm coming home  
And I said I'll check in  
Tomorrow if I don't wake up dead  
This is the road to ruin  
We're starting at the end
