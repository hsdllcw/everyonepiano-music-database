### Religion歌词：

Everything is fine now  
Let sleeping dogs lay  
All our minds made up now  
All our beds are made  
No one's out of time, no  
Chips fall wherever they may  
Leave it all behind, let the ocean wash it away

It never was about the money or the drugs  
For you, there's only love  
For you, there's only love  
It never was about the party or the clubs  
For you, there's only love

Cause you're my religion  
You're how I'm living  
When all my friends say I should take some space  
Well I can't envision, that for a minute  
When I'm down on my knees, you're how I pray  
Hallelujah, I need your love  
Hallelujah, I need your love

Everything is bright now  
No more cloudy days, even when  
The storms come, in the eye we'll stay  
No need to survive now  
All we do is play, all I hear is  
Music like Lay Lady Lay

It never was about the money or the drugs  
With you, there's only love  
With you, there's only love  
It never was about the party or the clubs  
For you, there's only love

Cause you're my religion  
You're how I'm living  
When all my friends say I should take some space  
Well I can't envision, that for a minute  
When I'm down on my knees, you're how I pray  
Hallelujah, I need your love  
Hallelujah, I need your love

You're my religion  
You're how I'm living  
When all my friends say I should take some space  
Well I can't envision, that for a minute  
When I'm down on my knees, you're how I pray  
Hallelujah, I need your love  
Hallelujah, I need your love
