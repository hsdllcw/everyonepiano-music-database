### Ludens歌词：

Some resist the future some refuse the past  
Either way it's messed up if we can't unplug the fact  
That a world covered in cables was never wired to last  
So don't act so surprised when the program starts to crash  
How do I  
Form a connection when we can't even shake hands  
You're like the phantom greeting me  
We plot in the shadows hang out in the gallows  
Stuck in a loop for eternity  
Do you know why the flowers never bloom  
Will you retry or let the pain resume  
I need a new leader we need a new Luden  
A new Luden new Luden yeah  
So come outside it's time to see the tide  
It's out of sight but never out of mind  
I need a new leader we need a new Luden  
Sticks and stones may break my bones but soon the sting will pass  
But names can dig so many graves you won't know where to stand  
And I don't feel secure no more unless I'm being followed  
And the only way to hide myself  
Is to give 'em one hell of a show  
How do I  
Form a connection when we can't even shake hands  
You're like the phantom greeting me  
We plot in the shadows hang out in the gallows  
Stuck in a loop for eternity  
Do you know why the flowers never bloom  
Will you retry or let the pain resume  
I need a new leader we need a new Luden  
A new Luden new Luden yeah  
So come outside it's time to see the tide  
It's out of sight but never out of mind  
I need a new leader we need a new Luden  
A new Luden new Luden yeah  
A new Luden new Luden yeah  
A new Luden new Luden yeah  
A new Luden new Luden yeah  
Yeah  
Alright you call this a connection  
You call this a connection  
You call this a connection  
Okay  
You call this a connection  
Oh give me a break  
Oh give me a break  
Oh give me a break  
Okay  
Ugh oh  
Do you know why the flowers never bloom  
Will you retry or let the pain resume  
I need a new leader we need a new Luden  
A new Luden new Luden yeah  
So come outside it's time to see the tide  
It's out of sight but never out of mind  
I need a new leader we need a new Luden  
A new Luden new Luden yeah  
A new Luden new Luden yeah  
A new Luden new Luden yeah  
A new Luden new Luden yeah  
Do you know why the flowers never bloom  
Will you retry or let the pain resume  
I need a new leader we need a new Luden
