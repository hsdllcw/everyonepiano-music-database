### Positions歌词：

Heaven sent you to me  
I'm just hopin' I don't repeat history  
Boy I'm tryna meet your mama on a Sunday  
And make a lotta love on a Monday  
Ah ah  
Never need no  
No  
No one else babe  
'Cause I'll be  
Switchin' the positions for you  
Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom  
I'm in the Olympics way I'm jumping through hoops  
Know my love infinite nothing I wouldn't do  
That I won't do switchin' for you  
Perfect perfect  
You're too good to be true  
You're too good to be true  
But I get tired of runnin' f**k it  
Now I'm runnin' with you  
With you  
Said boy I'm tryna meet your mama on a Sunday  
And make a lotta love on a Monday  
Ah ah  
Never need no  
No  
No one elsе babe  
'Cause I'll be  
Switchin' thе positions for you  
Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom  
I'm in the Olympics way I'm jumping through hoops  
Know my love infinite nothing I wouldn't do  
That I won't do switchin' for you  
Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom  
I'm in the Olympics way I'm jumping through hoops  
Know my love infinite nothing I wouldn't do  
Nothin'  
That I won't do switchin' for you  
This some s**t that I usually don't do  
Yeah  
But for you I kinda kinda want to  
Mmm  
'Cause you're down for me and I'm down too  
And I'm down too  
Yeah I'm down too  
Switchin' the positions for you  
This some s**t that I  
Yeah  
Usually don't do  
Don't do  
But for you I kinda kinda want to  
Mmm  
'Cause you're down for me and I'm down too  
Switchin' the positions for you  
Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom  
I'm in the Olympics way I'm jumping through hoops  
Know my love infinite nothing I wouldn't do  
That I won't do switchin' for you  
Ooh woah  
Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom  
I'm in the Olympics way I'm jumping through hoops  
Know my love infinite nothing I wouldn't do  
I wouldn't do  
That I won't do switchin' for you  
Yeah  
Ah yeah  
Ah  
Ah  
Yeah
