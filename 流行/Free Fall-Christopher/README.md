### Free Fall歌词：

If you know, I know  
Standing on the edge of mystery  
If you jump, I jump  
That's the only way to set us free fall  
Jumping until we free fall

Baby, this is where  
Baby, this is where you run away  
Baby, this is where you wanna be  
Baby, this is where you run away, run away

How can two people  
Fall in love at the same time  
Acting like it's not possible  
We're both in denial  
When you see the leaves falling  
Baby know that you can lean on me  
I can't promise anything  
You just gotta trust me, baby

If you know, I know  
Standing on the edge of mystery  
If you jump, I jump  
That's the only way to set us free fall  
Jumping until we free fall

Baby, this is where  
Baby, this is where you run away  
Baby, this is where you wanna be  
Baby, this is where you run away, run away

You're almost out there, out there  
But we gotta go  
You don't have to be scared, be scared  
To be on your own  
When you see the leaves falling  
Baby know that you can lean on me  
I can't promise anything  
You just gotta trust me, baby

If you know, I know  
Standing on the edge of mystery  
If you jump, I jump  
That's the only way to set us free fall  
Jumping until we free fall

Baby, this is where  
Baby, this is where you run away  
Baby, this is where you wanna be  
Baby, this is where you run away, run away
