You Are The Sunshine Of My Life  
你如阳光让我焕发生机  
That's Why I'll Always Stay Around  
为此我将对你不离不弃  
You Are The Apple Of My Eye  
你是我眼里最美丽的风景  
Forever You'll Stay In My Heart

I Feel Like This Is The Beginning  
我想我们将开启一段爱旅  
Though I've Loved You For A Million Years

And If I Thought Our Love Was Ending  
如果有天我发现爱到尽头  
I'd Find Myself Drowning In My Own Tears

You Must Have Known That I Was Lonely  
你定是知道了我寂寞许久  
Because You Came To My Rescue  
所以才与我邂逅把我拯救  
And I Know That This Must Be Heaven  
我想这就是天堂了  
How Could So Much Love Be Inside Of You
