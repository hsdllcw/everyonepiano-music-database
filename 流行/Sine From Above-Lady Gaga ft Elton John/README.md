### Sine From Above歌词：

When I was young  
I prayed for lightning  
My mother said it would come and find me  
I found myself without a prayer  
I lost my love and no one cared  
When I was young  
I prayed for lightning  
Yeah I looked  
With my face up to the sky but I saw nothing there  
No no nothing there  
Yeah I stared  
While my eyes filled up with tears but there was nothing there  
No no nothing  
I heard one sine from above  
I heard one sine from above  
Then the signal split in two  
The sound created stars like me and you  
Before there was us there was silence  
I heard one sine  
And it healed my heart  
Heard a sine  
Healed my heart  
Heard a sine  
Healed my heart  
Heard a sine  
When I was young  
I felt immortal  
And not a day went by without a struggle  
I lived my days just for the nights  
I lost myself under the lights  
When I was young  
I felt immortal  
Yeah I looked  
With my face up to the sky but I saw nothing there  
No no nothing there  
Yeah I stared  
While my eyes filled up with tears but there was nothing there  
No no nothing  
I heard one sine from above  
I heard one sine from above  
Then the signal split in two  
The sound created stars like me and you  
Before there was us there was silence  
I heard one sine  
And it healed my heart  
Heard a sine  
Healed my heart  
Heard a sine  
Healed my heart  
Heard a sine  
Then the signal split in two  
The sound created stars like me and you  
Before there was us there was silence  
I heard one sine  
And it healed my heart  
Heard a sine  
Healed my heart  
Healed my heart  
Healed my heart
