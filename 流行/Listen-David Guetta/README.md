### Listen歌词：

Let's hit the road and the way to go  
Take a new direction to a different coast  
Maybe we should try and put it on the line  
You gotta trust me now, turn up the radio  
To know the worlds and roll with the melody  
Baby, listen close and open up your mind

Imagine it, anywhere  
More than miles, I'll take you there  
Knew one day, from the start  
We'll be as one, now here we are

All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen

Listen, all we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen

Sounds are like in the wind  
Like puzzling violins  
I can be your rhythm in the silence  
Every time we sing, it echoes in the sky  
Let me close your eyes, help you fantasize  
Make a kiss our playlist in entire night  
Listen to the words as I let them fly

Imagine it, anywhere  
More than miles, I'll take you there  
Knew one day, from the start  
We'll be as one, now here we are

All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen

Listen, all we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen

Listen, all we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen
