### Kids Again歌词：

Can't believe I still avoid the East Side  
Even though I know that you don't live there now  
Lately you're the only thing on my mind  
And I can't stop myself from driving by your house  
Ooh every time I hear our song it kind of hurts me still  
And ooh even after all this time I kind of miss you still  
I'm wondering  
Do you even think about it  
The way that we changed the world and don't it make you sad  
That we'll never be kids again  
No we'll never be kids again  
Tell me how you live without it  
Did somebody change your world and now you don't look back  
Cos we'll never be kids again  
No we'll never be kids again  
No we'll never never ever ever ever ever  
Living out of suitcases in hotels  
Drinking way too much and talking through the night  
Really wish I didn't know you so well  
Wouldn't be so hard to leave the past behind  
Ooh every time I hear our song it kind of hurts me still  
And ooh even after all this time I kind of miss you still  
I'm wondering  
Do you even think about it  
The way that we changed the world and don't it make you sad  
That we'll never be kids again  
No we'll never be kids again  
Tell me how you live without it  
Did somebody change your world and now you don't look back  
'Cos we'll never be kids again  
No we'll never be kids again  
No we'll never never ever ever ever ever  
Do you even think about it  
The way that we changed the world and don't it make you sad  
That we'll never be kids again  
No we'll never be kids again  
Tell me how you live without it  
Did somebody change your world and now you don't look back  
'Cos we'll never be kids again  
No we'll never be kids again  
No we'll never never ever ever ever ever
