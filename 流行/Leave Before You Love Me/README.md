### Leave Before You Love Me歌词：

I see you calling  
I didn't wanna leave you like that  
It's five in the morning, yeah, yeah  
A hundred on the dash  
'Cause my wheels are rolling  
Ain't taking my foot off the gas  
And it only took the one night  
To see the end of the line  
Staring deep in your eyes, eyes  
Dancing on the edge, 'bout to take it too far  
It's messing with my head, how I mess with your heart  
If you wake up in your bed, alone in the dark  
I'm sorry, gotta leave before you love me  
Ay, ay, leave before you love me  
Ay, ay, leave before you love me  
Ay, ay, leave before you love me  
Ay, ay, leave before you love me  
I'm so good at knowing  
Of when to leave the party behind  
Don't care if they notice, yeah, yeah, no  
I'll just catch a ride  
I'd rather be lonely, yeah  
Than wrapped around your body too tight  
Yeah, I'm the type to get naked  
Won't give my heart up for breaking  
'Cause I'm too gone to be staying, staying  
(Dancing on) Dancing on the edge, 'bout to take it too far  
It's messing with my head, how I mess with your heart  
If you wake up in your bed, alone in the dark  
I'm sorry, gotta leave before you love me  
Ay, ay, leave before you love me  
Ay, ay, leave before you love me  
Ay, ay, leave before you love me  
Ay, ay, leave before you love me  
Dancing on the edge, take it too far  
Messing with my head, how I mess with your heart  
I'm sorry, alone in the dark  
I'm sorry, ay, ay, leave before you love me
