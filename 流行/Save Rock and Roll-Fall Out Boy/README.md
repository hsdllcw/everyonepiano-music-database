**Save Rock and Roll** 是芝加哥摇滚乐队Fall Out Boy专辑《Save Rock And
Roll》同名歌曲。乐队组建于2001年，曾获格莱美提名。充满年轻活力朝气，畅快将庞克的不羁气焰完全释放，些许EMO风格夹带流畅声线， Fall Out
Boy虽然和时下偶像团体般，在团名中加入个"Boy"字眼，但是，他们可完全不按牌理出牌，踢爆时下做作男孩偶像团体的面具，给你最热血的新世代之音。

_Save Rock And Roll_ 专辑由参与过Taylor Swift专辑「Red」、Avril Lavigne专辑「Goodbye
Lullaby」的制作人Butch
Walker担纲制作，专辑体现乐团擅长鼓动乐迷跟唱气氛的副歌段落，流露戏谑神采的双关语歌词，满载着情感的吉他摇滚，营造动人歌曲气势的唱作功力。

### Save Rock and Roll歌词：

I need more dreams  
And less life  
And I need that dark  
In a little more light  
I cried tears you'll never see  
So fuck you, you can go cry me an ocean  
And leave me be

You are what you love  
Not who loves you  
In a world full of the word yes  
I'm here to scream

No, no  
Wherever I go, go  
Trouble seems to follow  
Only plugged in to save rock and roll  
Rock and roll, no  
Wherever I go, go  
Trouble seems to follow  
Only plugged in to save rock and roll

Blood brothers in desperation  
An oath of silence  
For the voice of our generation  
Woah! how'd it get to be only me?  
Like I'm the last damn kid still kicking  
That still believes

I will defend the faith  
Going down swinging  
I will save the songs  
That we can't stop singing

No, no  
Wherever I go, go  
Trouble seems to follow  
Only plugged in to save rock and roll  
Rock and roll, no  
Wherever I go, go  
Trouble seems to follow  
Only plugged in to save rock and roll  
Oh no, we won't go  
Cause we don't know when to quit oh oh  
Oh no, we won't go  
Cause we don't know when to quit no no  
Oh no, we won't go  
Cause we don't know when to quit oh oh  
Oh no, we won't go  
Cause we don't know when to quit no no

You are what you love  
Not who loves you  
In a world full of the word 'yes'  
I'm here to scream

No, no  
Wherever I go, go  
Trouble seems to follow  
Only plugged in to save rock and roll  
Rock and roll, no  
Wherever I go, go  
Trouble seems to follow  
Only plugged in to save rock and roll  
Oh no, we won't go  
Cause we don't know when to quit oh oh  
Oh no, we won't go  
Cause we don't know when to quit oh oh  
Oh no, we won't go  
Cause we don't know when to quit oh oh  
Oh no, we won't go  
Cause we don't know when to quit oh oh  
Oh no, we won't go  
Cause we don't know when to quit oh oh  
Oh no, we won't go  
Cause we don't know when to quit oh oh
