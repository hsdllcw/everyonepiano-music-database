### Legends歌词：

I usually don't speak on sh*t like this but  
Ain't nobody else saying sh*t  
Daytrip took it to ten  
I usually have an answer to the question  
But this time I'm gon' be quiet  
Be quite this time this time  
Ain't nothing like the feeling of uncertainty  
The eeriness of silence  
This time it was so unexpected  
Last time it was the drugs he was lacing  
All legends fall in the making  
Sorry truth  
Dying young demon youth  
What's the 27 cluuuub  
We ain't making it past 21  
I been going through paranoia  
So I always gotta keep a gun  
D**n that's the world we live in now  
Yeah hold on just hear me out  
They tell me I'ma be a legend  
I don't want that title now  
'Cause all the legends seem to die out  
What the f**k is this 'bout  
I'm tryna make it out  
I'm tryna change the world  
I'm tryna take her out  
I'm tryna take the girl  
More importantly I'm tryna change the world  
Maybe flex with some diamonds and pearls yeah  
I usually have an answer to the question  
But this time I'm gon' be quiet be quiet this time  
This time  
Ain't nothing like the feeling of uncertainty  
The eeriness of silence  
This time it was so unexpected  
Last time it was the drugs he was lacing  
All legends fall in the making  
Sorry truth dying young  
Demon youth  
Demon youth  
Demon youth  
My mind is foggy I'm so confused  
We keep on losing our legends to  
The cruel cold world what is it coming to  
The end of the world is it coming soon  
Yeah ooh ooh oh  
That hit's for you  
I usually have an answer to the question  
But this time I'm gon' be quiet be quiet this time  
This time  
Ain't nothing like the feeling of uncertainty  
The eeriness of silence  
This time it was so unexpected  
Last time it was the drugs he was lacing  
All legends fall in the making  
Sorry truth dying young demon youth  
Demon youth  
Demon youth  
Demon youth  
Demon youth  
Demon youth  
Demon youth  
Demon youth  
Demon youth  
Demon youth  
Demon youth
