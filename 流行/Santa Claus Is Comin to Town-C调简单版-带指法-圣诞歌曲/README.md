### Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town歌词：

You better watch out you better not cry  
You better not pout I'm tellin' you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
He's makin' a list and checkin' it twice  
Gonna find out who's naughty an' nice  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
He sees you when you're sleepin'  
He knows when you're awake  
He knows if you've been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake  
You better watch out you better not cry  
You better not pout I'm tellin' you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
Say better watch out you better not cry  
Better not pout I'm tellin' you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
He's makin' a list an' checkin' it twice  
Gonna find out who's naughty an' nice  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
He sees you when you're sleepin'  
He knows when you're awake  
He knows if you've been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake  
Oh you better watch out you better not cry  
You better not pout I'm tellin' you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town
