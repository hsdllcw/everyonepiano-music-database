**Dark Side** 是Kelly
Clarkson所演唱的歌曲，收录自专辑《Stronger》中。它在2012年4月19日作为专辑第三支单曲发行。凯莉•克莱森（Kelly
Clarkson），1982年4月24日在德克萨斯州沃思堡市出生，美国女歌手、演员。虽然歌声风格多变，充满灵性，打动了亿万电视观众的心，但多少掩盖了一个事实：在唱功背后，她还是天赋甚好的原创音乐人。

_Dark Side_ 此曲延续了上支单曲"Stronger (What Doesn't Kill
You)"的励志主题，每个人都会有“阴暗面”，但请不要放弃与逃避。Kelly那高亢的嗓音，给予人继续坚持的信心与勇气。

### Dark Side歌词：

Oh oh oh, there's a place that I know  
It's not pretty there and few have ever gone  
If I show it to you now  
Will it make you run away?  
Or will you stay  
Even if it hurts  
Even if I try to push you out  
Will you return?  
And remind me who I really am  
Please remind me who I really am  
Everybody's got a dark side  
Do you love me?  
Can you love mine?  
Nobody's a picture perfect  
But we're worth it  
You know that we're worth it  
Will you love me?  
Even with my dark side?  
Like a diamond  
From black dust  
It's hard to know  
What can become  
If you give up  
So don't give up on me  
Please remind me who I really am  
Everybody's got a dark side  
Do you love me?  
Can you love mine?  
Nobody's a picture perfect  
But we're worth it  
You know that we're worth it  
Will you love me?  
Even with my dark side?  
Don't run away  
Don't run away  
Just tell me that you will stay  
Promise me you will stay  
Don't run away  
Don't run away  
Just promise me you will stay  
Promise me you will stay  
Will you love me? ohh  
Everybody's got a dark side  
Do you love me?  
Can you love mine?  
Nobody's a picture perfect  
But we're worth it  
You know that we're worth it  
Will you love me?  
Even with my dark side?  
Don't run away  
Don't run away  
Don't run away  
Promise you'll stay
