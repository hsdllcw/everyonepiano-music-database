### Starving歌词：

You know just what to say  
你知道跟谁该说些什么  
Shit that scares me  
糟糕这让我感到有点害怕  
I should just walk away  
我应该干脆点走开的  
But I can't move my feet  
但我挪不动脚步  
The more that I know you  
我了解你的越多  
The more I want to  
就越想接近你得到你  
Something inside me has changed  
内心的想法开始动摇  
I was so much younger yesterday  
昨天的我还太年轻  
I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you  
直到品尝到你之前我都没察觉自己已饥肠辘辘  
Don't need no butterflies when you give me the whole damn zoo  
我再也不需要追捕蝴蝶，当你给了我整个动物园  
By the way, By the way, you do things to my body  
顺便，顺便，你对我的身体做了些什么  
And I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you  
直到品尝到你之前我都没察觉自己已饥肠辘辘  
By the way, by the way, you do things to my body

You know just how to make

My heart beat faster  
我的心跳加快  
Emotional Earthquake  
心神不定  
Bring on disaster  
心乱如麻  
You hit me head on  
你迎面痛击我  
Got me weak in my knees  
让我的膝盖变得软弱无力
