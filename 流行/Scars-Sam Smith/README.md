### Scars歌词：

This is for my mother from the older brother of your children made of three  
Now you found your lover  
'Cause it wasn't our father who made you laugh and happy  
It's been a long five years  
I've cried a thousand tears and here we are after the war  
But we're so much better now the skies are clearer  
Now there's no more slamming doors  
Now I say  
Dear mother how you've come so far  
Your love has fixed all of our broken hearts  
I hope you're proud mother of what you've done  
It's a lifelong lesson and I'm not pretending when I say  
You cleared up my scars  
You cleared up my scars  
This is for my father from the older brother of your children made of three  
Yeah you've been so good to us and showed us how to live  
And taught us to be free  
But when mother told you  
That she didn't love you all these bridges hit the sea  
So you built another one and helped us cross it  
Even though you were in need  
Now I say  
Dear father how you've come so far  
Your love has fixed all of our broken hearts  
I hope you're proud father of what you've done  
It's a lifelong lesson and I'm not pretending when I say  
You cleared up my scars  
You cleared up my scars  
You cleared up my scars  
You cleared up my scars  
Dear mother how you've come so far  
Your love has fixed all of our broken hearts  
I hope you're proud mother of what you've done  
It's a lifelong lesson and I'm not pretending when I say  
You cleared up my scars
