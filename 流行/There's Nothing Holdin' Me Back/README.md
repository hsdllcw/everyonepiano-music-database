### There's Nothing Holdin' Me Back歌词：

I wanna follow where she goes  
I think about her and she knows it  
I wanna let her take control  
'Cause every time that she gets close, yeah  
She pulls me in enough to keep me guessing, mmm  
And maybe I should stop and start confessing  
Confessing, yeah  
Oh, I've been shaking  
I love it when you go crazy  
You take all my inhibitions  
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back  
You take me places that tear up my reputation  
Manipulate my decisions  
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back  
There's nothing holdin' me back  
There's nothing holdin' me back  
She says that she's never afraid  
Just picture everybody naked  
She really doesn't like to wait  
Not really into hesitations  
Pulls me in enough to keep me guessing, whoa  
And maybe I should stop and start confessing  
Confessing, yeah  
Oh, I've been shaking  
I love it when you go crazy  
You take all my inhibitions  
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back  
You take me places that tear up my reputation  
Manipulate my decisions  
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back  
There's nothing holdin' me back  
'Cause if we lost our minds  
And we took it way too far  
I know we'd be alright,  
Know we would be alright  
If you were by my side  
And we stumbled in the dark  
I know we'd be alright,  
Oh no we would be alright  
'Cause if we lost our minds  
And we took it way too far  
I know we'd be alright,  
I know we would be alright  
If you were by my side  
And we stumbled in the dark  
I know we'd be alright,  
We would be alright  
Oh, I've been shaking  
I love it when you go crazy  
You take all my inhibitions  
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back  
You take me places that tear up my reputation  
Manipulate my decisions  
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back  
There's nothing holdin' me back  
I feel so free  
When you're with me,  
Baby  
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
