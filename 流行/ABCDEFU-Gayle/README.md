### ABCDEFU歌词：

F**k you and your mom and your sister and your job  
And your broke a*s car and that s**t you call art  
F**k you and your friends that I'll never see again  
Everybody but your dog you can all f**k off  
I swear I meant to mean the best when it ended  
Even tried to bite my tongue when you start s**t  
Now you're textin' all my friends asking questions  
They never even liked you in the first place  
Dated a girl that I hate for the attention  
She only made it two days what a connection  
It's like you'd do anything for my affection  
You're goin' all about it in the worst ways  
I was into you but I'm over it now  
And I was tryin' to be nice  
But nothing's getting through so let me spell it out  
A B C D E F U  
And your mom and your sister and your job  
And your broke a*s car and that s**t you call art  
F**k you and your friends that I'll never see again  
Everybody but your dog you can all f**k off  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah  
A B C D E F U  
You said you just needed space and so I gave it  
When I had nothin' to say you couldn't take it  
Told everyone I'm a b***h so I became it  
Always had to put yourself above me  
I was into you but I'm over it now  
And I was tryin' to be nice  
But nothing's getting through so let me spell it out  
A B C D E F U  
And your mom and your sister and your job  
And your craigslist couch and the way your voice sounds  
F**k you and your friends that I'll never see again  
Everybody but your dog you can all f**k off  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah  
A B C D E F U  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah  
A B C D E F U  
And your mom and your sister and your job  
And your broke a*s car and that s**t you call art  
F**k you and your friends that I'll never see again  
Everybody but your dog you can all f**k off
