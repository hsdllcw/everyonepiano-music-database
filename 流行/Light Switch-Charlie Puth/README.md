### Light Switch歌词：

Yeah  
Why you callin' at 11:30  
When you only wanna do me dirty?  
But I hit right back  
'Cause you got that-that, yeah  
Why you always wanna act like lovers?  
But you never wanna be each others'  
I say, "Don't look back"  
But I go right back and  
All a sudden, I'm hypnotized  
You're the one that I can't deny  
Every time that I say I'm gonna walk away  
You turn me on like a light switch  
When you're movin' your body around and around  
Now, I don't wanna fight this (No)  
You know how to just make me want  
You turn me on like a light switch  
When you're movin' your body around and around  
You got me in a tight grip (Yeah)  
You know how to just make me want you, baby  
Do you love it when you keep me guessin' (Me guessin')  
When you're leaving then you leave me stressin'? (Me stressin')  
But I can't stay mad when you walk like that, no  
Why you always wanna act like lovers?  
But you never wanna be each others'  
I say, "Don't look back"  
But I go right back and  
All a sudden, I'm hypnotized (Hypnotized)  
You're the one that I can't deny (Can't deny)  
Every time that I say I'm gonna walk away (Yeah)  
You turn me on like a light switch  
When you're movin' your body around and around  
Now, I don't wanna fight this (No)  
You know how to just make me want  
You turn me on like a light switch (Switch)  
When you're movin' your body around and around  
You got me in a tight grip (Grip)  
You know how to just make me want you, baby  
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on and show me how you do (You do)  
You want, you want, you want, you want, you wanna keep me wantin' you (Me
wantin' you, girl)  
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on and (Hey), show me how you do (How
you do)  
You want, you want, you want, you want, you wanna keep me wantin' you  
You turn me on like a light switch  
When you're movin' your body around and around  
Now, I don't wanna fight this  
You know how to just make me want to  
You turn me on like a light switch  
When you're movin' your body around and around  
You got me in a tight grip  
You know how to just make me want you, baby  
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on and show me how you do (How you
do)  
You want, you want, you want, you want, you wanna keep me wantin' you (Wanna
keep me wantin' you, baby)  
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on and show me how you do (You do)  
You want, you want, you want, you want, you wanna keep me wantin' you
