### How To Love歌词：

One two three  
I've been running from the pain  
Trying not to feel the same  
But it's a shame that we're sinking  
See my confidence is shaking  
And my heart is feeling vacant  
So you try to fill it in  
You say I could fix the broken in your heart  
You're worth saving darling  
But I don't know why you're shooting in the dark  
I got faith in nothing  
But love pray for me  
I never had somebody  
So I don't know how to love  
Pray for me  
I know I need somebody  
So I can learn how to love  
I know it's been a while  
Cause my memory's on trial  
For the way I used to be  
My head is running miles  
Round in circles and I try  
To find the little light in me  
You say I could fix the broken in your heart  
You're worth saving darling  
But I don't know why you're shooting in the dark  
I got faith in nothing  
But love pray for me  
I never had somebody  
So I don't know how to love  
Pray for me  
I know I need somebody  
So I can learn how to love  
I know I need somebody  
I know I need somebody  
I know I need somebody  
So I can learn how to love  
How to love  
How to love  
So I can learn how to love  
How to love  
How to love  
I know I need somebody  
I know I need somebody  
I know I need somebody  
So I can learn how to love
