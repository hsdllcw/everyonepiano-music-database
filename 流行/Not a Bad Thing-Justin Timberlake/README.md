### Not a Bad Thing歌词：

[Verse 1]  
Said all I want from you is to see you tomorrow  
不用怀疑无论晨昏定省我只想见到你  
And every tomorrow, maybe you’ll let me borrow your heart  
幻想着某一天也许我能住进你的心里  
And is it too much to ask for every Sunday  
迫切期盼每个闲暇我们都能待在一起  
If I were radical and every other day to start  
贪心如我希望这日子永远也不要停息  
I know people make promises all the time  
我知道人们总是喜欢对爱情许下誓言  
Then they turn right around and break them  
而后却在转念之间环顾左右彷徨食言  
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife, while you beating  
你真心付出的时候他却在你的伤口撒盐  
But I could be that guy to heal it over time  
但创痕会随时间而痊愈因为有我的出现  
And I won’t stop until you believe it  
我不会停止爱你在你相信这是永远之前  
Cause baby you’re worth it  
因为你的名字早就已经烙印进我的心间  
[Chorus]  
So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me  
所以别假装怀疑我的真心让自己以为爱上我不是件好事情  
Cause you might look around and find your dreams come true, with me  
你可以试着四处搜寻你会发现和我一起你就能与梦想靠近  
Spend all your time and money just find out my love was free  
挥霍了所有的金钱和光阴才了解我的爱只为你而取之不尽  
So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me, me  
那么请不要假装怀疑来和我一起享受恋爱这件美妙的事情  
It’s not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me  
放心跳入我的甜蜜陷阱一起感受恋爱这看似坏坏的小事情  
[Verse 2]  
Now how about I’d be the last voice you hear at night?  
每个夜阑都在我的晚安声中入眠可好  
And every other night for the rest of the nights that there are  
今后所有日暮月移我都在你身边祝祷  
Every morning I just wanna see you staring back at me  
每个晨曦我都希望你的双眸对我闪耀  
'Cause I know that’s a good place to start  
因为这美妙的开始预示着好运的来到  
I know people make promises all the time  
我知道人们总是喜欢对爱情许下誓言  
Then they turn right around and break them  
而后却在转念之间环顾左右彷徨食言  
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife, while you beating  
你真心付出的时候他却在你的伤口撒盐  
But I could be that guy to heal it over time  
但创痕会随时间而痊愈因为有我的出现  
And I won’t stop until you believe it  
我不会停止爱你在你相信这是永远之前  
Cause baby you’re worth it  
因为你的名字早就已经烙印进我的心间  
[Chorus]

No I won’t feel your mind, broken promises, and waste of time  
不去理会那信任或背叛的世情  
And if you fall, you’ll always land right in these arms  
我必会接住你失足坠落的身影  
These arms of mine  
在我的怀抱里你不会迷失自己

[Hook]  
If I had a pair of wings  
I’d pick you and fly you far away from here  
And you’d put your worries upon my shoulders, my dear  
Now I know I can’t save you  
From the troubles of the world  
And this sounds like such a silly thing  
But if I could I'd fly you away  
On a big old pair of wings  
And if I had a pair of wings  
I’d pick you and fly you far away from here  
And we’d fly so high up in the sky  
Where the stars are so clear  
And then I could save you  
From the troubles of the world  
And all you’d have to pack is your heart to bring  
And there we are, you and me  
Flying on a big ol’ pair of wings, mmm  
[Verse]  
We keep getting older, the world keeps getting colder  
Tell me when did we lose our way?  
It’s so hard not to lose your mind in such crazy days  
But if I had one wish, I know what I’d wish for  
There’s only one thing that will do  
I’d fly away on this pair of wings with you  
[Hook]  
If I had a pair of wings  
I’d scoop you up we’d fly away and disappear  
And you could put your worries upon my shoulders, my dear  
Now I know I can’t save you  
From the troubles of the world  
I know this sounds like such a silly thing  
But if I could, I'd fly you away  
On a big old pair of wings  
And if I had a pair of wings  
I’d pick you and fly you far away from here  
And I could stay right by your side and keep you so near  
And then I could save you form the troubles of the world  
And all you’d have to pack is your heart to bring  
And there we are, you and me  
Flying on a big ol’ pair of wings  
[Verse]  
We keep getting older, the world keeps getting colder  
Tell me when did we lose our way?  
It’s so hard not to lose your mind in such crazy days  
And if I had one wish I know what I’d wish for  
There’s only one thing that’ll do  
I’ll fly away on this pair of wings with you  
If I had one wish I know what I’d wish for  
There’s only one thing that’ll do  
I’d fly away on this pair of wings with you  
I said if I had one wish I know what I’d wish for  
There’s only one thing that’ll do  
I’d fly away on this pair of wings with you oh yeaah.
