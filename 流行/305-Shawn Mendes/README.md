**305** 是加拿大创作歌手Shawn Mendes演唱的歌曲，收录在其第四张录音室专辑Wonder中。

《诗经•关雎》有曰“窈窕淑女，君子好逑。求之不得，寤寐思服。悠哉悠哉，辗转反侧。”而《 _305_
》这首歌曲的歌词恰恰就是描述了这样一个状态：一个男生喜欢上了一个女生，而迟迟得不到女生的肯定，失眠导致了恐惧，极度恐惧导致了愤怒，最后他着急了。而也有人说此曲是Mendes唱给Camila
Cabello，来纪念两个人在Miami生活的大半年时光的。

### 305歌词：

It's 3:05  
I'm on a rollercoaster ride  
Hoping you don't change your mind  
I don't wanna let go never been so sure in my life  
You're my sunlight on a rainy day  
Would take my heart with you if you walked away  
I'm a mess right now I'm a wreck right now  
I'm waiting for the moment that you let me down  
If you cut the cord I don't know what I'd do  
Don't wanna skydive without my parachute  
I'm a mess right now baby help me out  
I'm scared I'm gonna wake up and you'll let me down  
This feeling doesn't fade no matter how hard that I try  
I always think about it at the same time every night  
It's 3:05  
I'm on a rollercoaster ride  
Hoping you don't change your mind  
I don't wanna let go never been so sure in my life  
I'm terrified  
You'll turn around and say goodbye  
Hoping you don't change your mind  
I don't wanna let go I've never been so sure in my life  
If there's a door to heaven baby you're the key  
And if I had to beg I'd be on my knees  
Oh please don't say anything has changed  
You're the one I wanna wake up next to every day  
This feeling doesn't fade no matter how hard that I try  
I always think about it at the same time every night  
It's 3:05  
I'm on a rollercoaster ride  
Hoping you don't change your mind  
I don't wanna let go never been so sure in my life  
I'm terrified  
You'll turn around and say goodbye  
Hoping you don't change your mind  
I don't wanna let go I've never been so sure in my life  
I want to be with you  
I want to fly with you  
I want to be with you  
It's 3:05  
I'm on a rollercoaster ride  
Hoping you don't change your mind  
I don't wanna let go never been so sure  
Baby I'm terrified  
You'll turn around and say goodbye  
Hoping you don't change your mind  
Please don't change your mind  
I don't wanna let go  
I've never been so sure in my life
