### Havana歌词：

[Camila Cabello:]  
Havana, ooh na-na (ay)  
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ay, ay)  
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na  
All of my heart is in Havana (ay)  
There's somethin' 'bout his manners (uh huh)  
Havana, ooh na-na  
He didn't walk up with that "how you doin'?"  
(When he came in the room)  
He said there's a lot of girls I can do with  
(But I can't without you)  
I'm doin' forever in a minute  
(That summer night in June)  
And papa says he got malo in him  
He got me feelin' like  
Ooh... I knew it when I met him  
I loved him when I left him  
Got me feelin' like  
Ooh... and then I had to tell him  
I had to go, oh na-na-na-na-na  
Havana, ooh na-na (ay)  
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ay, ay)  
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na (uh huh)  
All of my heart is in Havana (ay)  
My heart is in Havana  
Havana, ooh na-na  
[Young Thug:]  
Jeffery  
Just graduated, fresh on campus, mmm  
Fresh out East Atlanta with no manners, damn  
Fresh out East Atlanta  
Bump on her bumper like a traffic jam (jam)  
Hey, I was quick to pay that girl like Uncle Sam (here you go, ay)  
Back it on me, shawty cravin' on me  
Get to diggin' on me (on me)  
She waited on me (then what?)  
Shawty cakin' on me, got the bacon on me (wait up)  
This is history in the makin' on me (on me)  
Point blank, close range, that be  
If it cost a million, that's me (that's me)  
I was gettin' mula, man they feel me
