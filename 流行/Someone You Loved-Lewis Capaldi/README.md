### Someone You Loved歌词：

I'm going under and this time  
I fear there's no one to save me  
This all or nothing really got  
A way of driving me crazy  
I need somebody to heal  
Somebody to know  
Somebody to have  
Somebody to hold  
It's easy to say  
But it's never the same  
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed  
All the pain  
Now the day bleeds  
Into nightfall  
And you're not here  
To get me through it all  
I let my guard down  
And then you pulled the rug  
I was getting kinda used to being someone  
You loved  
I'm going under and this time  
I fear there's no one to turn to  
This all or nothing way of loving got me  
Sleeping without you  
Now I need somebody to know  
Somebody to heal  
Somebody to have  
Just to know how it feels  
It's easy to say but it's never the same  
I guess I kinda liked the way  
You helped me escape  
Now the day bleeds  
Into nightfall  
And you're not here  
To get me through it all  
I let my guard down  
And then you pulled the rug  
I was getting kinda used to being  
Someone you loved  
And I tend to close my eyes  
When it hurts sometimes  
I fall into your arms  
I'll be safe in your sound  
'Til I come back around  
For now the day bleeds  
Into nightfall  
And you're not here  
To get me through it all  
I let my guard down  
And then you pulled the rug  
I was getting kinda used to being someone  
You loved  
But now the day bleeds  
Into nightfall  
And you're not here  
To get me through it all  
I let my guard down  
And then you pulled the rug  
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved  
I let my guard down  
And then you pulled the rug  
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
