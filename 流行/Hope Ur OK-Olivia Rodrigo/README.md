### Hope Ur OK歌词：

I knew a boy once when I was small  
A towhead blond with eyes of salt  
He played the drum in the marching band  
His parents cared more about the Bible  
Than being good to their own child  
He wore long sleeves 'cause of his dad  
And somehow we fell out of touch  
Hope he took his bad deal and made a royal flush  
Don't know if I'll see you again someday  
But if you're out there I hope that you're okay  
My middle school friend grew up alone  
She raised her brothers on her own  
Her parents hated who she loved  
She couldn't wait to go to college  
She was tired 'cause she was brought into a world  
Where family was merely blood  
Does she know how proud I am she was created  
With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred  
We don't talk much but I just gotta say  
I miss you and I hope that you're okay  
Address the letters to the holes in my butterfly wings  
Nothing's forever nothing's as good as it seems  
And when the clouds won't iron out  
And the monsters creep into your house  
Every door is hard to close  
Well I hope you know how proud I am you were created  
With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred  
But God I hope that you're happier today  
'Cause I love you  
And I hope that you're okay
