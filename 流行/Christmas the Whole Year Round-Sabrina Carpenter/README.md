### Christmas the Whole Year Round歌词：

One two one two three  
Let's make the whole year christmas  
No reason to forget this  
Feeling we're feeling now  
We gotta keep it going all year round  
Let's keep the sleigh bells ringing  
We'll keep the whole world singing  
Feels so good what's done now  
Let's make christmas the whole year round  
Da da da da da da da da  
Da da da da da da da da  
I don't care when snow stops falling down  
Santa's come and gone yeah he's left town  
I don't need a christmas tree  
Mistletoe or red and green  
All I need is you next to me  
To make every night christmas eve  
Let's make the whole year christmas  
No reason to forget this  
Feeling we're feeling now  
We gotta keep it going all year round  
Let's keep the sleigh bells ringing  
We'll keep the whole world singing  
Feels so good what's done now  
Let's make christmas the whole year round  
Da da da da da da da da  
Da da da da da da da da  
When all those pretty lights have been put away  
And old rudolph is gone on holiday  
Oh we'll keep that fire burning  
Though the calendar is turning  
Watch everyone pay you full  
When we can have 364 more  
Let's make the whole year christmas  
No reason to forget this  
Feeling we're feeling now  
We gotta keep it going all year round  
Let's keep the sleigh bells ringing  
We'll keep the whole world singing  
Feels so good what's done now  
Let's make christmas the whole year round  
I don't need a christmas tree  
Mistletoe or red and green  
All I need is you next to me  
To make every night christmas eve  
Let's make the whole year christmas  
No reason to forget this  
Feeling we're feeling now  
We gotta keep it going all year round  
Let's keep the sleigh bells ringing  
We'll keep the whole world singing  
Feels so good what's done now  
Let's make christmas the whole year  
Make christmas the whole year  
Let's make christmas the whole year round  
Da da da da da da da da  
Da da da da da da da da  
Da da da da da da da da  
Let's make christmas the whole year
