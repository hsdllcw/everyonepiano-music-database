### Heartbreak Anniversary歌词：

Ooh  
Balloons are deflated  
Guess they look lifeless like me  
We miss you on your side of the bed mmm  
Still got your things here  
They stay with me like souvenirs  
Don't wanna let you out my head  
Just like the day that I met you  
The day I thought forever  
Say that you love me but that'll last for never  
It's cold outside like when you walked out my life  
Why you walked out my life  
I get like this every time  
On these days that feel like you and me  
Heartbreak anniversary  
'Cause I remember every time  
On these days that feel like you and me  
Heartbreak anniversary  
Do you ever think of me  
No  
No-no no-no  
Ooh-ooh  
Nah  
I'm buildin' my hopes up  
Like presents unopened to this day  
I still see the messages you read hmm  
I'm foolishly patient  
Foolishly patient  
Can't get past the taste of your lips  
Taste of your lips  
Don't wanna let you out my head  
Just like the day that I met you  
The day I thought forever  
Say that you love me but that'll last for never  
It's cold outside like when you walked out my life  
Why you walked out my life  
I get like this every time  
On these days that feel like you and me  
Heartbreak anniversary  
'Cause I remember every time  
On these days that feel like you and me  
Heartbreak anniversary  
Do you ever think of me  
Of me  
'Cause I think of you think of you
