聆听Beegie
Adair的歌曲，仿佛在遍及着过分修饰与缺乏天赋的肤浅粗陋表演且干燥贫瘠的音乐景象中找到了一片凉爽的绿洲。爵士乐的新老乐迷们一律都为她着重精巧技术的词风和曲风所倾倒。

### Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow歌词：

Oh, the weather outside is frightful  
But the fire is so delightful  
And since we've no place to go  
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow,  
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow,  
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow  
It doesn't show signs of stopping  
And I've bought some corn for popping  
The lights are turned away down low  
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow,  
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow,  
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow  
When we finally kiss goodnight  
How I'll hate going out in the storm  
But if you'll really hold me tight  
All the way home  
I'll be warm  
The fire is slowly dying  
And, my dear, we're still good-bying  
But as long as you love me so  
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow,  
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow,  
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow  
When we finally kiss goodnight  
How I'll hate going out in the storm  
But if you'll really hold me tight  
All the way home  
I'll be warm  
The fire is slowly dying  
And my dear, we're still good-bying  
But as long as you love me so  
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow,  
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow,  
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow  
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow,  
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow,  
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow  
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow,  
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow,  
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow
