### Love Wins歌词：

A stray bullet and a momma cries  
Her baby won't be coming home tonight  
Sirens screaming down the avenue  
Just another story on the evening news oh whoa  
Politics and prejudice  
How the hell it'd ever come to this  
When everybody's gotta pick a side  
It don't matter if you're wrong or right no  
And so it goes but I hold onto hope and I won't let go 'cause  
I I believe you and me are sisters and brothers  
And I I believe we're made to be here for each other  
And we'll never fall if we walk hand in hand  
Put a world that seems broken together again  
Yeah I I believe in the end love wins  
Sometimes it takes a lot of faith  
To keep believing there will come a day  
When the tears and the sadness the pain and the hate  
The struggle this madness will all fade away yeah  
I I believe you and me are sisters and brothers  
And I I believe we're made to be here for each other  
And we'll never fall if we walk hand in hand  
Put a world that seems broken together again  
Yeah I I believe in the end love wins  
Love is power love is a smile  
Love reaches out love is the remedy  
Love is the answer love's an open door  
Love is the only thing worth fighting for yeah  
I I believe you and me are sisters and brothers  
And I I believe we're made to be here for each other  
And we'll never fall if we walk hand in hand  
Put a world that seems broken together again  
Yeah I I believe in the end love wins  
Oh yeah love wins  
Love will love can love still love wins  
Love will love can love still love wins
