### Stop This Flame歌词：

My heart goes up my heart goes down  
We fall in love and we fall back out  
I'll give you anything you want anything you want  
Anything anything just don't tell me no  
You stop it still then you make it rush  
You're like a pill that I just can't touch  
You tell me to stop but I keep on going  
Tell me to stop but I keep on going  
Tell me to stop but I keep on going  
Keep on keep on keep on  
You'll never stop this flame I will never let you go  
Well who am I to say  
Maybe by now you should know  
You got your somebody calling  
You think you're somebody don't you  
I think you're scared of keeping somebody close  
You'll never stop this flame I will never let you go  
Wasn't it enough or did I move too far  
Is it all too much  
I think I must be mad to give you everything I had everything I had  
Everything everything but I still went bad  
Tell me to stop but I keep on going  
Tell me to stop but I keep on going  
Tell me to stop but I keep on going  
Keep on keep on keep on  
You'll never stop this flame I will never let you go  
Well who am I to say  
Maybe by now you should know  
You got your somebody calling  
You think you're somebody don't you  
I think you're scared of keeping somebody close  
You'll never stop this flame I will never let you go  
Keep away from me if you can't withstand my love  
Keep away from me away from me if you think you must  
Keep away from me if you can't withstand my love  
Keep away from me away from me if you think you must  
You'll never stop this flame I will never let you go  
Well who am I to say  
Maybe by now you should know  
You got your somebody calling  
You think you're somebody don't you  
I think you're scared of keeping somebody close  
You'll never stop this flame I will never let you go
