**Prayer in C** 是法国另类、流行、民谣二人组Lilly Wood and the Prick发行的歌曲。乐队由Nili
Hadida和Benjamin Cotto组成。2006年，两人相识于巴黎的一家咖啡馆，旋即决定共同创作并组成乐队。

乐队首张工作室专辑《Invincible Friends》于2010年5月31日发行。而 _Prayer in C_
这支单曲即出自这张专辑中。原本是一首很普通和典型的独立音乐调的歌，并没有引起很大注意，但是2014年一位来自德国的新人DJ Robin
Schulz重新制作了这首歌，从而引起轰动。新推出的版本出人意料的大受欢迎，很快席卷整个欧洲，登上奥地利、比利时、法国、德国、匈牙利、意大利、卢森堡、荷兰、瑞士等国的音乐排行榜。

### Prayer in C歌词：

Yah, you never said a word  
You didn't send me no letter  
Don't think I could forgive you

See our world is slowly dying  
I'm not wasting no more time  
Don't think I could believe you

Yah, you never said a word  
You didn't send me no letter  
Don't think I could forgive you

See our world is slowly dying  
I'm not wasting no more time  
Don't think I could believe you

Yah, our hands will get more wrinkled  
And our hair will be grey  
Don't think I could forgive you

And see the children are starving  
And their houses were destroyed  
Don't think they could forgive you

Hey, when seas will cover lands  
And when men will be no more  
Don't think you can forgive you

Yah when there'll just be silence  
And when life will be over  
Don't think you will forgive you

Yah, you never said a word  
You didn't send me no letter  
Don't think I could forgive you

See our world is slowly dying  
I'm not wasting no more time  
Don't think I could believe you

Yah, you never said a word  
You didn't send me no letter  
Don't think I could forgive you

See our world is slowly dying  
I'm not wasting no more time  
Don't think I could believe you

Yah, our hands will get more wrinkled  
And our hair will be grey  
Don't think I could forgive you

And see the children are starving  
And their houses were destroyed  
Don't think they could forgive you

Hey, when seas will cover lands  
And when men will be no more  
Don't think you can forgive you

Yah when there'll just be silence  
And when life will be over  
Don't think you will forgive you
