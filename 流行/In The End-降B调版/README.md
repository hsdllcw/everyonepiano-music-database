林肯公园(Linkin Park)乐队在全球影响力最大的一首歌，不提前奏的悲凉，不提高潮的震撼，单是歌词，在末尾的那一句:"In the end,it
doesn't even matter！"就足以让人瞬间产生发自内心的感慨。特别值得一提的是，这首歌的爵士鼓谱子是一个极其好的练习曲。

### In the end英文歌词：

It starts with one thing

I don't know why

It doesn't even matter

How hard you try

Keep that in mind

I designed this rhyme

To explain in due time

All I know

Time is a valuable thing

Watch it fly by

As the pendulum swings

Watch it count down

To the end of the day

The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal

Didn't look out below

Watch the time go

Right out the window

Trying to hold on,

But didn't even know

Wasted it all just

To watch you go

I kept everything inside and

Even though I tried,

It all fell apart

What it meant to me will

Eventually be a

Memory of a time when

I tried so hard

And got so far

But in the end

It doesn't even matter

I had to fall

To lose it all

But in the end

It doesn't even matter

One thing,

I don't know why

It doesn’t even matter

How hard you try,

Keep that in mind

I designed this rhyme,

To remind myself how

I tried so hard

In spite of the way

You were mocking me

Acting like I was

Part of your property

Remembering all the

Times you fought with me

I'm surprised it got so (far)

Things aren't the way

They were before

You wouldn't even

Recognise me anymore

Not that you

Knew me back then

But it all comes

Back to me (in the end)

You kept everything inside

And even though I tried,

It all fell apart

What it meant to me will

Eventually be a

Memory of a time when I

I tried so hard

And got so far

But in the end

It doesn't even matter

I had to fall

To lose it all

But in the end

It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you

Pushed as far as I can go

For all this

There's only one thing you should know

I've put my trust in you

Pushed as far as I can go

For all this

There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard

And got so far

But in the end

It doesn't even matter

I had to fall

To lose it all

But in the end

It doesn't even matter

### In the end 中文歌词：

现在 有件事 我不明白 为什么

不管你怎样努力都无济于事

我把它保存在记忆里

写下这首歌曲 在适当的时间 作一下解释

我所知道的是

时间是宝贵的 看着它随着钟摆飞逝

看着一天天慢慢结束

生命在钟表的滴答声中流逝

如此的不真实 我没有料到以下的事

看着时光从窗外流过

我努力地想坚持 但却不知道

我投入一切的结果 是看着你离我而去

我只能把一切放在心里

即使我努力过 也无济于事

这一切对我来说

最后都 成为了一段往事
