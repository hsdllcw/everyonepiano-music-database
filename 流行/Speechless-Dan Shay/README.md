### Speechless歌词：

You say you'll be down in 5  
The smell of your perfume is floating down the stairs  
You're fixing up your hair like you do  
I know that I'll be a mess  
The second that I see you  
You won't be surprised  
It happens every time  
It's nothing new  
It's always on a night like tonight  
I think that you can read my mind  
Cause when you look at me with those eyes  
I'm speechless  
Staring at you standing there in that dress  
What it's doing to me ain't a secret  
Cause watching you is all that I can do  
And I'm speechless  
You already know that you're my weakness  
After all this time I'm just as nervous  
Every time you walk into the room  
I'm speechless  
It started when you said hello  
Just did something to me  
And I've been in a daze  
Ever since the day that we meet  
You take the breath out of my lungs  
I can't even fight it  
And all of the words out of my mouth without even trying  
And I'm speechless  
Staring at you standing there in that dress  
What it's doing to me ain't a secret  
Cause watching you is all that I can do  
And I'm speechless  
You already know that you're my weakness  
After all this time I'm just as nervous  
Every time you walk into the room  
I'm speechless  
It's always on a night like tonight  
I think that you can read my mind  
Cause when you look at me with those eyes  
I'm speechless  
Staring at you standing there in that dress  
What it's doing to me ain't a secret  
Cause watching you is all that I can do  
And I'm speechless  
You already know that you're my weakness  
After all this time I'm just as nervous  
Every time you walk into the room  
I'm speechless  
Oh you know it baby
