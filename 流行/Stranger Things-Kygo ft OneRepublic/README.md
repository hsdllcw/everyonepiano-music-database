### Stranger Things歌词：

A stranger things  
We're like we're like a stranger things very far  
We're stranger things dream of places at  
Cause that's just who we are  
We used to run around this ghost town  
Always thinking out loud  
Are we gonna get out  
I remember  
We dream of places that we could go  
Castles with the strange glow  
People that we don't know  
I remember  
We left the light  
That's ordinary from the start  
We look for stranger things  
Cause that's just who we are  
Found me the edges something beautiful than love  
Like I'm picturing now  
Castles glitter under Spanish skies  
But I'm just looking after you tonight  
Snow and mountain to the foreign state  
Tell me someday we'll get there  
Someday  
Someday  
Oh oh  
Oh oh  
I see a Technicolor shadow  
Underneath your window  
Just in case you don't know  
I can see it  
You cast among an unfamiliar day glow  
Different than what I know  
Shining like a halo  
I can feel it  
We turned our back  
That's ordinary from the start  
We look for stranger things  
Cause that's just who we are  
Found me the edges something beautiful than love  
Show me the sky falling down  
Castles glitter under Spanish skies  
But I'm just looking after you tonight  
Snow and mountain to the ancient place  
Tell me someday we'll get there  
Someday  
Someday  
Oh oh  
Oh oh  
A stranger things  
We're like we're like a stranger things very far  
We're stranger things dream of places at  
Cause that's just who we are  
A stranger things  
We're like we're like a stranger things very far  
We're stranger things dream of places at  
Cause that's just who we are  
A stranger things  
We're like we're like a stranger things very far  
We're stranger things dream of places at  
Cause that's just who we are  
A stranger things  
We're like we're like a stranger things very far  
We're stranger things dream of places at  
Cause that's just who we are  
A stranger things  
We're like we're like a stranger things very far  
We're stranger things dream of places at  
Cause that's just who we are
