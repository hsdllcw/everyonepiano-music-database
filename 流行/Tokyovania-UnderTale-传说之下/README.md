### Tokyovania歌词：

(Papyrus)  
I gave mercy.  
Found forgiveness.  
Believed that somehow.  
I could still save your soul.  
I spared you.  
And my death is a symbol.  
Now i know.  
Your heart's DEAD and COLD.  
Although i'm Shattered.  
My strength will live through him.  
Who won't give in.  
To your hold.  
Now face the judgement.  
Of my own brother.  
He won't have mercy.  
On your soul.  
(Sans)  
Now there's no laughter here.  
Silence exists all around.  
This empty world you've brought.  
Will damn you to the ground.  
I thought you once were good.  
But motives came to be clear.  
I gave you TRUST and LOVE.  
And YOU created FEAR.  
(Both)  
Your DETERMINATION.  
Will not faze me.  
So come at me.  
With all your will.  
Know my spirit's stronger.  
Burning brighter.  
With the ones.  
You've KILLED.  
I am known as VENGEANCE.  
RETRIBUTION.  
And i'll drag you down.  
With me to HELL.  
Cause a kid like you.  
Should not exist.  
I know you won't be missed.  
(Papyrus)  
I gave mercy.  
Found forgiveness.  
Believed that somehow.  
I could still save your soul.  
I spared you.  
And my death is a symbol.  
Now i know.  
Your heart's DEAD and COLD.  
Although i'm Shattered.  
My strength will live through him.  
Who won't give in.  
To your hold.  
Now face the judgement.  
Of my own brother.  
He won't have MERCY.  
On your SOUL.  
(Both)  
I gave mercy.  
Found forgiveness.  
Believed that somehow.  
I could still save your soul.  
I spared you.  
And my death is a symbol.  
Now i know.  
Your heart's DEAD and COLD.  
Although i'm Shattered.  
My strength will live through him.  
Who won't give in.  
To your hold.  
Now face the judgement.  
Of my own brother.  
He won't have mercy.  
On your soul.
