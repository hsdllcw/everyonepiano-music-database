### Up with the Birds歌词：

The birds they sang, at break of day.  
"Start again", I hear them say.  
It's so hard to just walk away.  
The birds they sang, all a choir,  
"Start again a little higher".  
It's a spark in a sea of gray.

The sky is blue,  
Dreamed that lie 'til it's true,  
Then takin' back the punch I threw,  
My arms turn wings,  
Oh, those clumsy things  
Send me up to that wonderful world  
And then I'm up with the birds.

Might have to go where they don't know my name  
Float all over the world just to see her again  
And I won't show or fear any pain,  
Even though all my armor might rust in the rain

A simple plot but I know one day  
Good things are coming our way  
A simple plot but I know one day  
Good things are coming our way,  
Oh, yeah...
