### Bad Habits歌词：

Every time you come around you know I can't say no  
Every time the sun goes down I let you take control  
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes  
And tonight had something wonderful  
My bad habits lead to late nights ending alone  
Conversations with a stranger I barely know  
Swearing this will be the last but it probably won't  
I've got nothing left to lose or use or do  
My bad habits to lead to wide eyes stare into space  
And I know I lose control of the things that I say  
I was looking for a way out now I can't escape  
Nothing happens after two  
It's true it's true  
My bad habits lead to you  
My bad habits lead to you  
My bad habits lead to you  
Every pure intention ends when the good times start  
Falling over everything to reach the first times spark  
Started under neon lights then it all got dark  
I only know how to go too far  
My bad habits lead to late nights ending alone  
Conversations with a stranger I barely know  
Swearing this will be the last but it probably won't  
I've got nothing left to lose or use or do  
My bad habits to lead to wide eyes stare into space  
And I know I lose control of the things that I say  
I was looking for a way out now I can't escape  
Nothing happens after two  
It's true it's true  
My bad habits lead to you  
My bad habits lead to you  
We took the long way round  
And burned 'til the fun ran out now  
My bad habits lead to late nights ending alone  
Conversations with a stranger I barely know  
Swearing this will be the last but it probably won't  
I've got nothing left to lose or use or do  
My bad habits to lead to wide eyes stare into space  
And I know I lose control of the things that I say  
I was looking for a way out now I can't escape  
Nothing happens after two  
It's true it's true  
My bad habits lead to you  
My bad habits lead to you  
My bad habits lead to you
