**Different World双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Different World_ 是Alan Walker、K-391、Sofia
Carson与CORSAK一同合作的单曲。Alan的歌总是能给人们带来惊喜与希望，就像Faded中所言的神秘亚特兰蒂斯一样，给人以无穷无尽的幻想，以及对神秘未知的渴望，而这首新歌《Different
Word》则包含了对现实的哀叹，对向往世界追求所做出的一种誓言。

电音配合迷幻空灵的女声，营造出一种王者断刃，大战落下帷幕的恢弘场景，一声声鼓点像是炙热的心脏跳动。虽然这个世界不总尽如人意，但理想国终会降临。蒙上神秘的黑口罩，穿上黑色的战袍，你也是拯救世界的Superman。

Way")》的曲谱下载

### Different World歌词：

All we know  
Left untold  
Beaten by a broken dream  
Nothing like  
What it used to be  
We've been chasing our demons down an empty road  
Been watching our castle turning into dust  
Escaping our shadows just to end up here once more  
And we both know  
This is not the world we had in mind  
But we got time  
We are stuck on answers we can't find  
But we got time  
And even though we might have lost tonight  
The skyline reminds us of a different time  
This is not the world we had in mind  
But we got time  
Broken smiles  
Tired eyes  
I can feel your longing heart  
Call my name  
Howling from afar  
We've been fighting our demons just to stay afloat  
Been building our castle just to watch it fall  
Been running forever just to end up here once more  
And now we know  
This is not the world we had in mind  
But we got time  
We are stuck on answers we can't find  
But we got time  
And even though we might have lost tonight  
The skyline reminds us of a different time  
This is not the world we had in mind  
But we got time  
Take me back  
Back to the mountain side  
Under the northern lights  
Chasing the stars  
Take me back  
Back to the mountain side  
When we were full of life  
Back to the start  
And we both know that  
This is not the world we had in mind  
But we got time  
We are stuck on answers we can't find  
But we got time  
And even though we might have lost tonight  
The skyline reminds us of a different time  
This is not the world we had in mind  
But we got time
