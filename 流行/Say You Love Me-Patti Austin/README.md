### Say You Love Me歌词：

Don't you know that I want to be more than just your friend  
Holding hands is fine  
But I've got better things on my mind  
You know it could happen  
If you'd only see me in a different light  
Baby when we finally get together  
You will see that I was right  
Say you love me  
You know that it could be nice  
If you'd only say you love me  
Don't treat me like I was ice  
Please love me  
I'll be yours and you'll be mine  
And if you'd only say you love me baby  
Things would really work out fine  
Don't you know that I want to be more than just your friend  
Holding hands is fine  
But I've got better things on my mind  
You know it could happen  
If you'd only see me in a different light  
But baby when we finally get together  
You will see that I was right  
Say you love me  
You know that it could be nice  
If you'd only say you love me  
And don't treat me like I was ice  
Oh please love me  
I'll be yours and you'll be mine  
And if you'd only say you love me baby  
Things would really work out fine

If you'd only say you love me  
And don't treat me like I was ice

And if you'd only say you love me darling  
Things would really work out fine
