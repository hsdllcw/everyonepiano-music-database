美国摇滚大团梦龙乐队Imagine Dragons新单《 **Sharks** 》于2022年6月24日上线！收录于即将与乐迷见面的全新力作《Mercury
– Act 2》之中。

作为Imagine Dragons全新专辑的正式二单，《 _Sharks_
》和首单一样同样具备欢脱绚丽的风味，在专辑中相对属于后期创作阶段的这首歌，承载着更多沉重讽刺意味的玩笑思考。沿着一个黑暗的叙事主线，这首歌借由“鲨鱼（Sharks）”的明确意象烘托着类似男人的叙事状态，面临渐渐衰老而从未开启尖锐保护机制的自己，自我反思的奢求显得愈发重要，有点滑稽、讽刺甚至自我意识的大力润饰，使得整首歌在听感上更具先锋包容度，从而也提升了耐听维度。

### Sharks歌词：

Ha ha ha ha ha  
Trouble  
Blood is in the rocky waters  
Hide away your sons and daughters  
Eat you alive  
Eat you alive  
Levels  
Levels  
Better put your head on swivels  
Swivels  
Dancing with the very devil  
Devil  
Butter to knife  
Butter to knife  
You think you're better than them  
Better than them  
You think they're really your friends  
Really your friends  
But when it comes to the end  
To the end  
You're just the same as them  
Same as them  
Ha ha ha ha ha  
So let it go let it go  
That's the way that it goes  
First you're in then you're out  
Everybody knows  
You're hot then you're cold  
You're a light in the dark  
Just you wait and you'll see  
That you're swimming with sharks  
He's coming to get you  
Chicka-woo-woo  
He's coming to get you get  
Chicka-woo  
Bubbles  
Drowning you seeing doubles  
Don't you let them see your struggles  
Hiding your tears  
Crisis  
Take advantage of your niceness  
Cut you up in even slices  
Prey on your fears  
You think you're better than them  
Better than them  
You think you're better  
You think they're really your friends  
Really your friends  
But when it comes to the end  
To the end  
Oh no  
You're just the same as them  
Same as them  
Ha ha ha ha ha  
So let it go let it go  
That's the way that it goes  
First you're in then you're out  
Everybody knows  
You're hot then you're cold  
You're a light in the dark  
Just you wait and you'll see  
That you're swimming with sharks  
My blood is pumping  
He's coming to get you  
Don't take it from me  
Woo-woo  
My blood is pumping  
He's coming to get you get  
Don't take it from me  
My blood is pumping  
He's coming to get you  
Don't take it from me  
Woo-woo  
My blood is pumping  
He's coming to get you get  
Don't take it from me  
Every time my heart is beating  
I can feel the recipe  
I wonder if my day is gonna blame it on the entropy  
My blood is pumping I can see the end is right in front of me  
Don't take it from me I could be everything  
Everything  
Sharks  
Don't take it from me  
My blood is pumping my blood is pumping  
Sharks  
Don't take it from me I could be everything  
Everything  
So let it go let it go  
That's the way that it goes  
First you're in then you're out  
Everybody knows  
You're hot then you're cold  
You're a light in the dark  
Just you wait and you'll see  
That you're swimming with sharks  
My blood is pumping  
He's coming to get you  
Don't take it from me  
Woo-woo  
My blood is pumping  
He's coming to get you get  
Don't take it from me  
My blood is pumping  
He's coming to get you  
Don't take it from me  
My blood is pumping  
He's coming to get you get  
Don't take it from me
