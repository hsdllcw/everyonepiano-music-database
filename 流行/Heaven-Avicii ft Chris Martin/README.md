### Heaven歌词：

Step out into the dawn  
You pray 'til you pray 'til the lights come on  
And then you feel like you've just been born  
Yeah you come to raise me up  
When I'm beaten and broken up  
And now I'm back in the arms I love  
And I think I just died  
I think I just died  
Yeah I think I just died  
I think I just died  
And went to heaven  
Ooh  
And went to heaven  
Ooh  
Beaten and bathed in blood  
I'm hit by I'm hit by your love and drug  
And now you've come to raise me up  
Oh  
And I think I just died  
I think I just died  
Yeah I think I just died  
And went to heaven  
Ooh  
And went to heaven  
Ooh  
And went to heaven  
It's such a night such a beautiful night  
It's such a view such a beautiful sight  
I think I just oh I think I just died  
Ooh  
And went to heaven  
Ooh  
And went to heaven  
Ooh  
Oh yeah  
Ooh  
Yeah  
We're gonna be birds and fly  
We're gonna set the world alight  
We're gonna lose ourselves tonight  
Ooh  
We're going be birds and fly  
We're gonna set the world alight  
We're gonna lose ourselves tonight  
Ooh  
In heaven
