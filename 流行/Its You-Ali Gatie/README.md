### It's You歌词：

It's you it's always you  
If I'm ever gonna fall in love I know it's gon' be you  
It's you it's always you  
Met a lot of people but nobody feels like you  
So please don't break my heart don't tear me apart  
I know how it starts trust me I've been broken before  
Don't break me again I am delicate  
Please don't break my heart  
Trust me I've been broken before  
I've been broken yeah I know how it feels  
To be open and then find out your love isn't real  
I'm still hurting yeah I'm hurting inside  
I'm so scared to fall in love but if it's you then I'll try  
It's you it's always you  
If I'm ever gonna fall in love I know it's gon' be you  
It's you it's always you  
Met a lot of people but nobody feels like you  
So please don't break my heart don't tear me apart  
I know how it starts trust me I've been broken before  
Don't break me again I am delicate  
Please don't break my heart  
Trust me I've been broken before  
I know I'm not the best at choosing lovers  
Oh  
We both know my past speaks for itself  
For itself  
If you don't think that we're right for each other  
Baby no  
Then please don't let history repeat itself  
'Cause I want you yeah I want you yeah  
There's nothing else I want  
'Cause I want you yeah I want you yeah  
And you're the only thing I want  
It's you it's always you  
If I'm ever gonna fall in love I know it's gon' be you  
It's you it's always you  
Met a lot of people but nobody feels like you  
So please don't break my heart don't tear me apart  
I know how it starts trust me I've been broken before  
Don't break me again I am delicate  
Please don't break my heart  
Trust me I've been broken before  
'Cause I want you baby I want you  
Baby I want you baby I want you  
Baby I want you baby I want you  
Baby I want you you you  
'Cause I want you baby I want you  
Baby I want you baby I want you  
Baby I want you baby I want you  
Baby I want you you you
