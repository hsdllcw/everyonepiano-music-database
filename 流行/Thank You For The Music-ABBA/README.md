### Thank You For The Music歌词：

I'm nothing special in fact I'm a bit of a bore  
If I tell a joke you've probably heard it before  
But I have a talent a wonderful thing  
'Cause everyone listens when I start to sing  
I'm so grateful and proud  
All I want is to sing it out loud  
So I say  
Thank you for the music the songs I'm singing  
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing  
Who can live without it I ask in all honesty  
What would life be  
Without a song or a dance what are we  
So I say thank you for the music  
For giving it to me  
Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk  
She says I began to sing long before I could talk  
And I've often wondered how did it all start  
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart  
Like a melody can  
Well whoever it was I'm a fan  
So I say  
Thank you for the music the songs I'm singing  
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing  
Who can live without it I ask in all honesty  
What would life be  
Without a song or a dance what are we  
So I say thank you for the music  
For giving it to me  
I've been so lucky I am the girl with golden hair  
I wanna sing it out to everybody  
What a joy what a life what a chance  
Thank you for the music the songs I'm singing  
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing  
Who can live without it I ask in all honesty  
What would life be  
Without a song or a dance what are we  
So I say thank you for the music  
For giving it to me  
So I say thank you for the music  
For giving it to me
