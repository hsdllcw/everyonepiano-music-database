### Going Under歌词：

Now i will tell you what I've done for you  
50 thousand tears I've cried  
Screaming, deceiving and bleeding for you  
And you still won't hear me  
(I'm Going Under)  
Don't want your hand this time, I'll save myself  
Maybe I'll wake up for once  
Not tormented daily, defeated by you  
Just when I thought I reached the bottom  
I'm dying again  
I'm going under  
I'm falling forever  
I've got to break through  
I'm going under  
Blurring and stirring the truth and the lies  
So I don't know what's real and what's not  
Always confusing the thoughts in my head  
So I can't trust myself anymore  
I'M DYING AGAIN  
I'm going under  
Drowning in you  
I'm falling forever  
I've got to break through  
So go on and scream  
Scream at me I'm so far away  
I won't be broken again  
I've got to breathe I can't keep going under

I'm dying again  
I'm going under  
Drowning in you  
I'm falling forever  
I'm going under  
Going under  
I'm going under
