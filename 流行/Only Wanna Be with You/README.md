### Only Wanna Be with You歌词：

You and me we come from different worlds  
You like to laugh at me when I look at other girls  
Sometimes you're crazy then you wonder why  
I'm such a baby 'cause the cowboys make me cry  
Well there's nothing I can do  
I've been looking for a girl like you  
You look at me you've got nothing left to say  
I moan and pout at you until I get my way  
I won't dance you won't sing  
I just wanna love you but you wanna wear my ring  
Well there's nothing I can do  
I only wanna be with you  
You can call me your fool  
I only wanna be with you  
Put on a little Dylan sitting on a fence  
I say that line is great you ask me what it meant by  
Said I shot a man named Gray took his wife to Italy  
She inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me  
I can't help it if I'm lucky  
I only wanna be with you  
Ain't Bobby so cool  
I only wanna be with you  
Yeah I'm tangled up and blue  
I only wanna be with you  
You can call me your fool  
I only wanna be with you  
Sometimes I wonder if it'll ever end  
You get so mad at me when I go out with my friends  
Sometimes you're crazy then you wonder why  
I'm such a baby yeah the cowboys make me cry  
Well there's nothing I can do  
I only wanna be with you  
You can call me your fool  
I only wanna be with you  
Yeah I'm tangled up in blue  
I only wanna be with you  
I only wanna be with you  
I only wanna be with you
