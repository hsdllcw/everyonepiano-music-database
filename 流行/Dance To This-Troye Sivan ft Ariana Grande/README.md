### Dance To This歌词：

Troye Sivan：  
Young ambition  
Say we'll go slow but we never do  
Premonition  
Seeing me spending every night with you  
Yeah under the kitchen lights  
You still look like dynamite  
And I wanna end up on you  
Don't need no place to go  
Just put on the radio  
You know what I wanna do  
We can just dance to this  
Don't take much to start me  
We can just dance to this  
Push up on my body  
And you know we've  
Already seen all of the parties  
We can just dance to this  
We can just  
We can just dance to this  
Dance to this  
We can just dance to this  
Ariana Grande：  
Dear beloved  
Bring those 501s a bit closer bit closer  
And dear my lover  
Do that thing we never do sober sober  
Both：  
Under the kitchen lights  
You still look like dynamite  
And I wanna end up on you yeah  
We don't need no place to go  
Just put on the radio  
You know what I wanna do  
We can just dance to this  
Don't take much to start me  
We can just dance to this  
Push up on my body  
And you know we've  
Already seen all of the parties  
We can just dance to this  
We can just  
We can just dance to this  
Dance to this  
We can just dance to this  
Troye Sivan：  
I don't want to sleep tonight  
I just want to take that ride yeah

Troye Sivan：  
Don't take much to start me

Both：

We can just dance to this  
Don't take much to start me

Push up on my body  
You know we already seen all of the parties
