**The Kids Aren't Alright** 是来自芝加哥的摇滚乐队Fall Out
Boy的歌曲。该乐队组建于2001年，曾获格莱美提名。充满年轻活力朝气，畅快将庞克的不羁气焰完全释放，些许EMO风格夹带流畅声线， Fall Out
Boy虽然和时下偶像团体般，在团名中加入个"Boy"字眼，但是，他们可完全不按牌理出牌，踢爆时下做作男孩偶像团体的面具，给你最热血的新世代之音！

### The Kids Aren't Alright歌词：

Stuck in the jet wash  
Bad trip I couldn’t get off  
And maybe I bit off more than I could chew  
And overhead of the aqua blue

Fall to your knees, bring on the rapture  
Blessed be the boys time can’t capture  
On film or between the sheets  
I always fall from your window to the pitch black streets

And with the black banners raised  
As the crooked smiles fade  
Former heroes who quit too late  
Who just wanna fill up the trophy case again

And in the end  
I’d do it all again  
I think you’re my best friend  
Don’t you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren’t alright?

I’ll be yours  
When it rains it pours  
Stay thirsty like before  
Don’t you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren’t alright?

I’m not passive, but aggressive  
Take note, it’s not impressive  
Empty your sadness  
Like you’re dumping your purse on my bedroom floor  
We put your curse in reverse

And it’s our time now if you want it to be  
Maul the world like the carnival bear set free  
And your love is anemic, and I can’t believe  
That you couldn’t see it coming for me

And I still feel that rush in my veins  
It twists my head just a bit too thin  
All those people in those old photographs I’ve seen are dead

And in the end  
I’d do it all again  
I think you’re my best friend  
Don’t you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren’t alright?

I’ll be yours  
When it rains it pours  
Stay thirsty like before  
Don’t you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren’t alright?

And sometimes I just wanna sit around and gaze at my shoes, yeah  
And let your dirty sadness fill me up just like a balloon

And in the end  
I’d do it all again  
I think you’re my best friend  
Don’t you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren’t alright?

I'll be yours  
When it rains it pours  
Stay thirsty like before  
Don’t you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren’t alright?
