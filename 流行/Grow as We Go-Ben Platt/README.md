### Grow as We Go歌词：

You say there's so much you don't know  
You need to go and find yourself  
You say you'd rather be alone  
'Cause you think you won't find it tied to someone else  
Ooo who said it's true  
That the growing only happens on your own  
They don't know me and you  
I don't think you have to leave  
If to change is what you need  
You can change right next to me  
When you're high I'll take the lows  
You can ebb and I can flow  
And we'll take it slow  
And grow as we go  
Grow as we go  
You won't be the only one  
I am unfinished I've got so much left to learn  
I don't know how this river runs  
But I'd like the company through every twist and turn  
Ooo who said it's true  
That the growing only happens on your own  
They don't know me and you  
You don't ever have to leave  
If to change is what you need  
You can change right next to me  
When you're high I'll take the lows  
You can ebb and I can flow  
And we'll take it slow  
And grow as we go  
Grow as we go  
Grow as we go  
Grow as we go  
I don't know who we'll become  
Ooooh  
I can't promise it's not written in the stars  
But I believe that when it's done  
We're gonna see that it was better  
That we grew up together  
Tell me you don't wanna leave  
'Cause a change is what you need  
You can change right next to me  
When you're high I'll take the lows  
You can ebb and I can flow  
We'll take it slow  
And grow as we go  
Grow as we go  
Grow as we go  
Grow as we go
