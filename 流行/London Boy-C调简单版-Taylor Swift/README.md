**London Boy** 是由美国流行女歌手Taylor Swift录唱的一首歌曲，被收录在Taylor
Swift的第七张录音室专辑《Lover》。专辑的基调设定为“浪漫”，她认为“Lover”不仅指爱情，还是一种生活态度，它不一定发生在快乐的时候，在朋友、家庭、愤怒之间、在失望中重新站起和你爱的所有事物，同样可以寻找浪漫。

Taylor用歌曲来记录她的生活，来定义一些她认为有意义值得纪念，来怒怼黑粉，她同时也是一个很棒的歌手，用将音乐融入生活，将生活融入音乐。

### London Boy歌词：

We can go driving in on my scooter ah you know just round London  
Oh  
I love my hometown  
As much as Motown  
I love SoCal  
And you know I love Springsteen  
Faded blue jeans  
Tennessee whiskey  
But something happened  
I heard him laughing  
I saw the dimples first and  
Then I heard the accent  
They say home is where the heart is  
But that's not where mine lives  
You know I love a London boy  
I enjoy walking Camden Market  
In the afternoon  
He likes my American smile  
Like a child when our eyes meet  
Darling I fancy you  
Took me back to Highgate  
Met all of his best mates  
So I guess  
All the rumors are true  
You know I love a London boy  
Boy I fancy you  
Now I love high tea  
Stories from uni and the West End  
You can find me in the pub we  
Are watchin' rugby  
With his school friends  
Show me a gray sky  
A rainy cab ride  
Babes don't threaten me with a good time  
They say home is where the heart is  
But God I love the English  
You know I love a London boy  
I enjoy nights in Brixton  
Shoreditch in the afternoon  
He likes my American smile  
Like a child when our eyes meet  
Darling I fancy you  
Took me back to Highgate  
Met all of his best mates  
So I guess  
All the rumors are true  
You know I love a London boy  
Boy I fancy you  
So please show me Hackney  
Doesn't have to be Louis V  
Up on Bond Street  
Just wanna be with you wanna be with you  
Stick with me I'm your queen  
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney  
On the Heath  
Just wanna be with you wanna be with you wanna be with you  
You know I love a London boy  
I enjoy walking Soho drinking in the afternoon  
He likes my American smile  
Like a child when our eyes meet  
Darling I fancy you  
Took me back to Highgate  
Met all of his best mates  
So I guess  
All the rumors are true  
You know I love a London boy  
Boy I fancy you  
So please show me Hackney  
Doesn't have to be Louis V  
Up on Bond Street  
Just wanna be with you wanna be with you  
Boy I fancy you  
Stick with me I'm your queen  
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney  
On the Heath  
Just wanna be with you wanna be with you  
I fancy you  
I fancy you
