### Lover of Mine歌词：

Lover of mine maybe we'll take some time  
Kaleidoscope mind gets in the way  
Hope and I pray darling that you will stay  
Butterfly lies chase them away mmm  
Dance around the living room  
Lose me in the sight of you  
I've seen the red I've seen the blue  
Take all of me  
Deep to where your secrets hide  
Where we've been a thousand times  
Swallow every single lie  
Take all of me  
I'll never give you away  
'Cause I already made that mistake  
If my name never fell off your lips again  
I know it'd be such a shame  
When I take a look at my life and all of my crimes  
You're the only thing that I think I got right  
I'll never give you away  
'Cause I already made already made that mistake  
Lover of mine I know you're colourblind  
I watched the world fall from your eyes ooh  
All my regrets and things you can't forget  
Light them all up kiss them goodbye  
Dance around the living room  
Lose me in the sight of you  
I've seen the red I've seen the blue  
Take all of me  
Deep to where your secrets hide  
Where we've been a thousand times  
Swallow every single lie  
Take all of me  
I'll never give you away  
'Cause I already made that mistake  
If my name never fell off your lips again  
I know it'd be such a shame  
When I take a look at my life and all of my crimes  
You're the only thing that I think I got right  
I'll never give you away  
'Cause I already made already made that mistake
