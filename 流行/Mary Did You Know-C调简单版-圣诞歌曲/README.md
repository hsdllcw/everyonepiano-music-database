说到当代最流行的圣诞歌曲，《 **Mary, Did You Know？** 》（玛丽亚，你知道吗？）无疑是其中之一。至今已被超过三十位艺术家演绎。

歌曲以向耶稣母亲玛丽亚提问的方式，来展现耶稣基督的诞生给世界带来的救赎以及表达对耶稣的颂赞。

这首歌曲的歌词写于1984年。当歌星和戏剧演员Mark
Lowry被邀为一个教会的圣诞戏剧写一个剧本时，他写下了一系列对耶稣的母亲玛丽亚的问题，这些问题被用作戏剧中的场景。之后，他尝试去寻找旋律来完成这首歌。12年后，音乐家和作词家Buddy
Greene为歌词谱曲，圣诞剧本终于变成了一首歌曲。

### Mary, Did You Know?歌词：

Mary did you know take your baby boy  
Would one day walk on water  
Mary did you know that your baby boy  
Would save our sons and daughters  
Did you know that your baby boy  
Has come to make you new  
This child that you've delivered  
Will soon deliver you  
Mary did you know that your baby boy  
Will give sight to a blind man  
Mary did you know that your baby boy  
Will calm a storm with His hand  
Did you know that your baby boy  
Has walked where angels trod  
And when you've kissed your little baby  
You've kissed the face of God  
Oh Mary did you know  
Mary did you know  
Mary did you know  
Mary did you know  
Mary did you know  
Mary did you know  
Mary did you know  
Mary did you know  
The blind will see the deaf will hear  
The dead will live a-gain  
The lame will leap the dumb will speak  
The praises of the Lamb  
Mary did you know that your baby boy  
Is Lord of all creation  
Mary did you know that your baby boy  
Will one day rule the nations  
Did you know that your baby boy  
Is heaven's perfect Lamb  
That's sleeping child you're holding  
Is the great I am  
Oh Mary did you know  
Mary did you know  
Mary did you know  
Mary did you know  
Mary did you know  
Mary did you know  
Mary did you know
