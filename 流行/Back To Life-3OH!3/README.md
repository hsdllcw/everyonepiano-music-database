### Back To Life歌词：

There's a drama in my heart beat, I know exactly where it's from  
That turn enough to street lambs, they say the day is almost done,  
There's a viny in my years now, I remember how it was,  
The feeling we had last night and it won't stop now because.  
Everybody says, hey no, we don't wanna see this day go  
If I ever had my say so,  
we can make this go all night night night.  
'Cause if the party is dead, we can bring it back to life,  
Yeah, we can make it through the night  
If you listen to the words I say,  
'cause if the party is dead,  
all we need is candle light, and a little bit of dynamite  
everybody won't get out of our way.  
I got a song stuck in my head,  
I know exactly why it's there  
there's a noise outside my bedroom,  
and I don't even care.  
If I ever said go home,  
everybody here would say hell no  
All we gotta do is just let go,  
We can make through it the night.  
'Cause if the party is dead, we can bring it back to life,  
Yeah, we can make it through the night  
If you listen to the words I say,  
'cause if the party is dead,  
all we need is candle light, and a little bit of dynamite  
everybody won't get out of our way.  
Oh oh oh oh..  
We can bring it back to life  
Yeah, we can bring it back to life.  
'Cause I'll never gonna get this promise out of my head,  
And I'm never gonna get some sleep inside of my bed,  
And I'm sorry if goodnight is something I've ever said..  
'Cause if the party is dead, we can bring it back to life,  
Yeah, we can make it through the night  
If you listen to the words I say,  
'cause if the party is dead,  
all we need is candle light, and a little bit of dynamite  
everybody won't get out of our way.  
Oh oh oh oh..  
We can bring it back to life  
Yeah, we can bring it back to life.
