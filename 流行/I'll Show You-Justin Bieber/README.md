### I’ll Show You 歌词：

My life is a movie and everyone's watching  
So let's get to the good part and past all the nonsense

Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing  
When the pressure's coming down like lightning  
It's like they want me to be perfect  
When they don't even know that I'm hurting

Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel  
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real  
Act like you know me, but you never will  
There's one thing that I know for sure  
I'll show you  
I'll show you  
I'll show you  
I'll show you

I've got to learn things, learn them the hard way  
Got to see what it feels like, no matter what they say

Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing  
When the pressure's coming down like lightning  
It's like they want me to be perfect  
When they don't even know that I'm hurting

Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel  
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real  
Act like you know me, but you never will  
There's one thing that I know for sure  
I'll show you  
I'll show you  
I'll show you  
I'll show you  
Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel  
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real  
Act like you know me, but you never will  
There's one thing that I know for sure

I'll show you  
I'll show you
