### Girls Like You歌词：

Spent 24 hours  
I need more hours with you  
You spent the weekend  
Gettin' even ooo  
We spent the late nights  
Makin' things right between us  
Now it's all good baby  
Roll that back wood baby  
And play me close  
Cause girls like you  
Run round with guys like me  
'Til sundown when I come through  
I need a girl like you  
Yay yay  
Girls like you  
Love fun  
And yeah me too  
What I want  
When I come through  
I need a girl like you  
Yay yay  
Yay yay yay  
Yay yay yay  
I need a girl like you  
Yay yay  
Yay yay yay  
Yay yay yay  
I need a girl like you  
I spent last night  
On the last flight to you  
Took a whole day up  
Tryna get way up ooo  
We spent the daylight  
Tryna make things right between us  
Now it's all good baby  
Roll that back wood baby  
And play me close yeah  
Cause girls like you  
Run round with guys like me  
'Til sundown when I come through  
I need a girl like you  
Yay yay  
Girls like you  
Love fun  
And yeah me too

Yay yay  
I need a girl like you  
Maybe it's 6:45  
Maybe I'm barely alive  
Maybe you've taken my sh*t for the last time yeah  
Maybe I know that I'm drunk  
Maybe I know you're the one  
Maybe I'm thinkin' it's better if you drive  
Cardi B：  
Not too long ago I was dancin' for dollars  
Knew it was really real if I let you met my momma  
You don't want a girl like me I'm too crazy  
But every other girl you meet is fugazy oookkurrt  
I'm sure them other girls were nice enough  
But you need someone to spice it up  
So who you gonna call Cardi Cardi  
To come and rev it up like a Harley Harley  
Why is the best fruit always forbidden  
I'm coming to you now doin' 20 over the limit  
The red light red light stop stop  
I don't play when it comes to my heart lets get it though  
I don't really want a white horse and a carriage  
I'm thinking more white porsches and karats  
I need you right here cause every time you fall  
I play with this kitty like you play witch your guitar  
Adam Levine：  
Cause girls like you girls like you  
Run round with guys like me  
'Til sundown when I come through  
I need a girl like you oohhh  
Yay yay  
Girls like you  
Love fun  
And yeah me too  
What I want  
When I come through  
I need a girl like you like you  
Yay yay

Yay yay yay  
Yay yay yay  
I need a girl like you
