### Happy歌词：

It might seem crazy what I’m about to say  
Sunshine she’s here, you can take away  
I’m a hot air balloon that could go to space  
With the air, like I don’t care baby by the way  
Because I’m happy  
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof  
Because I’m happy  
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth  
Because I’m happy  
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you  
Because I’m happy  
Clap along if you feel like that’s what you wanna do  
Here come bad news talking this and that  
Yeah, give me all you got, don’t hold back  
Yeah, well I should probably warn you I’ll be just fine  
Yeah, no offense to you don’t waste your time  
Here’s why  
Because I’m happy  
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof  
Because I’m happy  
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth  
Because I’m happy  
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you  
Because I’m happy  
Clap along if you feel like that’s what you wanna do  
Happy, bring me down, come on,  
Happy, bring me down  
Love is too happy to bring me down  
Come on, bring me down  
I said bring me down  
Come on, bring me down  
Love is too happy to bring me down  
Come on, bring me down  
I said  
Because I’m happy  
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof  
Because I’m happy  
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth  
Because I’m happy  
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you  
Because I’m happy  
Clap along if you feel like that’s what you wanna do  
Because I’m happy  
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof  
Because I’m happy  
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth  
Because I’m happy  
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you  
Because I’m happy  
Clap along if you feel like that’s what you wanna do
