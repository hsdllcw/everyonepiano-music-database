### This One's for You歌词：

We're born to fly  
So let's keep living 'til it all falls down  
Let's close our eyes  
And let the moment drive the whole world out  
We're in this together  
Hear our hearts beat together  
We stand strong together  
We're in this forever  
This one's for you  
This one's for you  
Waving colored flags  
We won't surrender there's no standing down  
There's a playing field  
It's full of winners we're breaking new ground  
We're in this together  
Hear our hearts beat together  
We stand strong together  
We're in this forever  
This one's for you  
This one's for you  
We're in this together  
Hear our hearts beat together  
We stand strong together  
We're in this forever  
This one's for you
