### Heaven歌词：

Strange light revolves around you  
You float across the room  
Your touch is made of something  
Heaven can't hold a candle to  
You're made of something new  
Let's not get complicated  
Let's just enjoy the view  
It's hard to be a human  
So much to put an answer to  
But that's just what we do  
God only knows where this could go  
And even if our love starts to grow out of control  
And you and me go up in flames  
Heaven won't be the same  
I'm having revelations  
You dance across the floor  
Beyond infatuation  
How I obsessively adore you  
That's what I do  
I believe I believe  
I could die in your kiss  
No it doesn't get doesn't get  
Better than this  
God only knows where this could go  
And even if our love starts to grow out of control  
And you and me go up in flames  
Heaven won't be the same  
God only knows where this could go  
And even if our love starts to grow out of control  
And you and me go up in flames  
Heaven won't be the same  
Heaven won't be the same  
I believe I believe  
I could die in your kiss  
No it doesn't get doesn't get  
Better than better than this  
God only knows where this could go  
And even if our love starts to grow out of control  
And you and me go up in flames  
Heaven won't be the same  
God only knows where this could go  
And even if our love starts to grow out of control  
And you and me go up in flames  
Heaven won't be the same
