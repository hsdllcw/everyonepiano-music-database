### The Game Is Over歌词：

I've had enough of kneeling  
I've had enough  
I've had enough of denial  
I'm not alright but I'm not gonna lie  
I don't know that I ever was  
All alone I've waited all alone  
Held it in as played by your rules  
I've been biting my lip but I'm losing my grip  
I'm coming down down down  
When all the hate burns off I'm left here with the pain  
Behind our vain devices aren't we all the same  
Ooh ah ah ah  
Change me into something I believe in  
Change me so I don't have to pretend  
I take a breath and try to play along  
But I'm a terrible liar  
I feel the world like a brick on my chest  
And the party's just begun  
Throw the rope and lead me through the mud  
From your mouth flow a thousand truths  
But you know there's only one  
When all the hate burns off I'm left here with the pain  
Ooh ah ah ah  
Change me into something I believe in  
Change me so I don't have to pretend  
Sweet words they mean nothing they're not true  
'Cause the game is over  
I want it all or I want nothing at all  
Maybe I can  
Change me into something I believe in  
Change me so I don't have to pretend  
Your sweet words they mean nothing save your breath  
The game is over
