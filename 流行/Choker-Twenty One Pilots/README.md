Icy”回归。

### Choker歌词：

Mm mm mm mm mm mm  
Mm mm mm mm mm mm  
I don't bother anyone  
Nervous when I stand  
Chokin' on the circumstance  
Only smokin' secondhand  
Mm mm  
Cut us open spread us out  
Mm mm  
Dry us in the sand  
Mm mm  
Lay the fibers side by side  
Mm mm  
And you'll begin to understand  
Mm mm  
I know it's over  
I was born a choker  
Nobody's comin' for me  
Comin' for me  
Mm mm  
I know it's over  
Mm mm mm mm  
I don't bother anyone  
Never make demands  
Chokin' on the circumstance  
Self sabotage is a sweet romance  
Mm mm  
Seems like all I'm worth is what I'm able to withstand  
Mm mm  
Sooner I can realize that pain is just a middleman  
I know it's over  
I was born a choker  
Nobody's comin' for me  
I see no volunteers to cosign on my fears  
I'll sign on the line  
Alone you're gonna change my circumstance  
I know I need to move right now  
'Cause I know it's over  
I was born a choker  
Nobody's comin' for me  
Only smokin' secondhand  
I know it's over  
I was born a choker  
Nobody's comin' for me  
Comin' for me  
Like a little splinter buried in your skin  
Someone else can carve it out but when you've got the pin  
It hurts a little less and you can even push it further in  
When your body's screamin' out trust your mind's listenin'  
Like a silhouette that you can barely see  
As a shadow cast upon the ground where you'll eventually  
Lay forever but the day goes on the sun moves behind you  
You get taller bolder stronger and the rearview only blinds you  
Mm mm mm mm mm mm
