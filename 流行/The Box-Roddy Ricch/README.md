### The Box歌词：

Pullin' out the coupe at the lot  
Told 'em f**k 12 f**k SWAT  
Bustin' all the bales out the box  
I just hit a lick with the box  
Had to put the stick in a box mmh  
Pour up the whole d**n seal  
I'ma get lazy  
I got the mojo deals  
We been trappin' like the '80s  
She sucked a n***a soul  
Got the Cash App  
Told 'em wipe a n***a nose say slatt slatt  
I won't never sell my soul and I can back that  
And I really wanna know where you at at  
I was out back where the stash at  
Cruise the city in a bulletproof Cadillac  
Skrrt  
'Cause I know these n***as after where the bag at  
Yeah  
Gotta move smarter gotta move harder  
N***a try to get me for my water  
I'll lay his a*s down on my son on my daughter  
I had the Draco with me Dwayne Carter  
Lotta n***as out here playin' ain't ballin'  
I done put my whole arm in the rim Vince Carter  
Yeah  
And I know probably get a key for the quarter  
Shawty barely seen in double C's I bought 'em  
Got a b***h that's looking like Aaliyah she a model  
I got the pink slip all my whips is key less  
Compton I'm about to get the key to the city  
Patek like the sea forget it  
Pullin' out the coupe at the lot  
Told 'em f**k 12 f**k SWAT  
Bustin' all the bales out the box  
I just hit a lick with the box  
Had to put the stick in a box mmh  
Pour up the whole d**n seal I'ma get lazy  
I got the mojo deals we been trappin' like the '80s  
She sucked a n***a soul got the Cash App  
Told 'em wipe a n***a nose say slatt slatt  
I won't never sell my soul and I can back that  
And I really wanna know where you at at hah  
Hahaha I been movin' 'em out  
It's still up with me then  
He got the blues in the pouch  
Yeah  
Took her to the forest  
Put the wood in her mouth  
B***h don't wear no shoes in my house  
The private I'm flyin' in  
I never wan' fly again  
I'll take my chances in traffic  
Yeah  
She suckin' on d**k no hands with it  
I just made the Rollie plain like a landing strip  
I'm a 2020 president candidate  
I done put a hundred bands on Zimmerman s**t  
I been movin' real gangster  
So that's why she picked a Crip  
Shawty call me Crisco 'cause I pop my s**t  
Got it out the mud  
There's nothin' you can tell me yeah  
When I had the drugs  
I was street wealthy yeah  
Pullin' out the coupe at the lot  
Told 'em f**k 12 f**k SWAT  
Bustin' all the bales out the box  
I just hit a lick with the box  
Had to put the stick in a box mmh  
Pour up the whole d**n seal I'ma get lazy  
I got the mojo deals  
We been trappin' like the '80s  
She sucked a n***a soul got the Cash App  
Told 'em wipe a n***a nose  
Say slatt slatt  
I won't never sell my soul  
And I can back that  
And I really wanna know where you at at
