### Beautiful Mistakes歌词：

It's beautiful it's bittersweet  
You're like a broken home to me  
I take a shot of memories and black out like an empty street  
I fill my days with the way you walk  
And fill my nights with broken dreams  
I make up lies inside my head  
Like one day you'll come back to me  
Now I'm not holding on  
Not holding on  
I'm just depressed that you're gone  
Not holding on  
Not holding on  
Beautiful mistakes  
I make inside my head  
She's naked in my bed  
And now we lie awake  
Making beautiful mistakes  
I wouldn't take em back  
I'm in love with the past  
And now we lie awake  
Making beautiful mistakes  
Nah nah nah  
In my head  
Nah nah nah  
In my bed  
Nah nah nah  
Making beautiful mistakes  
It's pitiful I can't believe  
How every day gets worse for me  
I take a break I cut you off  
To keep myself from lookin' soft  
I fill my nights with the way you was  
And still wake up with broken dreams  
I make these lies inside my head  
Feel like they're my reality  
Now I'm not holding on  
Not holding on  
I'm just depressed that you're gone  
Not holding on  
Not holding on  
Beautiful mistakes  
I make inside my head  
She's naked in my bed  
And now we lie awake  
Making beautiful mistakes  
I wouldn't take em back  
I'm in love with the past  
And now we lie awake  
Making beautiful mistakes  
Nah nah nah  
In my head  
Nah nah nah  
In my bed  
Nah nah nah  
Making beautiful mistakes  
You did me wrong cause I let you  
Usually I like my situations beneficial  
Doing something different  
Got me looking stupid  
The only way I'm coming back to you is if you dream it  
Lucid Prove it  
If you made a promise then keep it  
Why you wanna lie and then get mad I don't believe it  
But really I was doing just fine without ya  
Looking fine sippin' wine dancing on club couches  
Baby why you wanna lose me like you don't need me  
Like I don't block you and you still try to reach me  
How you figure out how to call me from the TV  
You runnin' out of chances and this time I mean it yeah  
Bet you miss my love all in your bed  
Now ya stressin' out pulling your hair  
Smelling your pillows and wishin I was there  
Sliding down the shower wall looking sad  
I know it's hard to let go I'm the best  
Best you ever had and best you gon' get  
If we break up I don't wanna be friends you're toxic  
Beautiful mistakes  
I make inside my head  
She's naked in my bed  
And now we lie awake  
Making beautiful mistakes  
I wouldn't take em back  
I'm in love with the past  
And now we lie awake  
Making beautiful mistakes  
Nah nah nah  
In my head  
Nah nah nah  
In my bed  
Nah nah nah  
Oh oh oh oh  
Making beautiful mistakes  
Nah nah nah  
In my head  
Nah nah nah  
In my bed  
Nah nah nah  
Making beautiful mistakes  
Nah nah nah  
Nah nah nah  
Nah nah nah
