### Jesus In LA歌词：

Well I shook hands with the devil  
Down on the south side  
And he bought us both a drink  
With a pad and a pencil sat by his side  
I said  
Tell me what you think  
I've been looking for my savior looking for my truth  
I even asked my shrink  
He brought me down to his level  
Said  
Son you're not special  
You won't find him where you think  
You won't find him down on sunset  
Or at a party in the hills  
At the bottom of the bottle  
Or when you're tripping on some pills  
When they sold you the dream you were just 16  
Packed a bag and ran away  
And it's a crying shame you came all this way  
'Cause you won't find Jesus in LA  
And it's a crying shame you came all this way  
'Cause you won't find Jesus in LA  
Took a sip of his whiskey  
Said  
Now that you're with me well  
I think that you should stay  
Yeah I know you've been busy  
Searching through the city  
So let me share the way  
I know I'm not your savior  
Know I'm not your truth  
But I think we could be friends  
He said  
Come down to my level hang out with the devil  
Let me tell you in the end  
You won't find him down on sunset  
Or at a party in the hills  
At the bottom of the bottle  
Or when you're tripping on some pills  
When they sold you the dream you were just 16  
Packed a bag and ran away  
And it's a crying shame you came all this way  
'Cause you won't find Jesus in LA  
And it's a crying shame you came all this way  
'Cause you won't find Jesus in LA  
And that is when I knew that it was time to go home  
And that is when I realized that I was alone  
And all the vibe and colors from the lights fade away  
And I don't care what they say  
You won't find him down on sunset  
Or at a party in the hills  
At the bottom of the bottle  
Or when you're tripping on some pills  
When they sold you the dream you were just 16  
Packed a bag and ran away  
And it's a crying shame you came all this way  
'Cause you won't find Jesus in LA  
I won't find him down on sunset  
Or at a party in the hills  
At the bottom of the bottle  
Or when I'm tripping on some pills  
When they sold me the dream I was just 16  
Packed my bag and ran away  
And it's a crying shame I came all this way  
'Cause I won't find Jesus in LA  
And it's a crying shame I came all this way  
'Cause I won't find Jesus in LA
