### And the Day Goes On歌词：

Woke up in the morning,  
traveling straight into the sun,  
Told my friends and family I was gone,  
Looked back in the mirror,  
thought about who I had become,  
and, I don't think that anything's gone wrong.  
Jumped out of my suitcase,  
and went traveling down the road,  
went back to the place that I was born,  
thinking about my future,  
thinking 'bout how far we have come,  
oh, I don't think I'm going to be going home.  
And the day goes on, goes on,  
goes on, goes on, and the day goes on,  
and the day goes on, goes on,  
goes on, hold on, and the day goes on,  
went down to Virginia,  
thinking 'bout how to change my name,  
just in case I have to fly away,  
jumped into my spaceship,  
and I went to outer space,  
and now I think I'm going to be O.K.  
And the day goes on, goes on,  
goes on, goes on, and the day goes on,  
and the day goes on, goes on,  
hold on, whenst the day goes (on),  
and I'm long gone,  
and I'm long gone,  
and I'm right where I belong.  
I went to the future,  
thinking 'bout how to spend my day,  
thinking 'bout the things I can't explain.  
It's 1900 and the times are going to change,  
oh now I think we're going to be O.K.  
And the day goes on, goes on,  
goes on, goes on, and it goes along,  
and the day goes on, hold on, hold on,  
stay strong, and the day goes on.
