**Happier Than Ever** 是美国女歌手Billie
Eilish第二张录音室专辑的同名曲。这次Billie演唱的方法不再像一专的狂野，神秘，而是更加的梦幻以及深情。

歌曲前半段延续了Billie平时慵懒低沉的唱腔，在幽静平淡的音乐氛围中，情绪表达长达两分半，而这像是在回忆过去那个不开心的自己。然而，后面却HIGH起来了，不仅推翻了前面所营造的静谧，甚至推翻了整张专辑前面所有歌曲所营造的脆弱、敏感、哀伤的状态。太惊艳了！

### Happier Than Ever歌词：

When I'm away from you  
I'm happier than ever  
Wish I could explain it better  
I wish it wasn't true mmm  
Give me a day or two  
To think of something clever  
To write myself a letter  
To tell me what to do mm-mm  
Do you read my interviews  
Or do you skip my avenue  
When you said you were passin' through  
Was I even on your way  
I knew when I asked you to  
When I asked you to  
Be cool about what I was tellin' you  
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do  
What you said you'd do  
And I'd end up more afraid  
Don't say it isn't fair  
You clearly weren't aware that you made me miserable ooh  
So if you really wanna know  
When I'm away from you  
I'm happier than ever  
Wish I could explain it better  
I wish it wasn't true mmm  
You called me again drunk in your Benz  
Drivin' home under the influence  
You scared me to death but I'm wastin' my breath  
'Cause you only listen to your f**kin' friends  
I don't relate to you  
I don't relate to you no  
'Cause I'd never treat me this s**tty  
You made me hate this city  
And I don't talk s**t about you on the internet  
Never told anyone anything bad  
'Cause that s**t's embarrassing you were my everything  
And all that you did was make me f**kin' sad  
So don't waste the time I don't have  
And don't try to make me feel bad  
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time  
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did  
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends so I  
Shut them all out for you 'cause I was a kid  
You ruined everything good  
Always said you were misunderstood  
Made all my moments your own  
Just f**kin' leave me alone
