**Still D.R.E.双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Still D.R.E._ 是美国说唱歌手Dr.
Dre的歌曲。Dr.Dre被认为西海岸痞子说唱的创始人和领军者。作为一名制作人，Dr.Dre的革新之处在于，他使嘻哈音乐变得成熟，并且与此同时，通过发行他那些里程碑式的专辑，将这一过程中的每一次重要变革都明确的表现了出来。在乐坛打拼几十年的Dr.Dre并未仅仅止步于说唱领域，他亦是亿万身家的企业大佬，这种角色转变导致其作品不同往昔，它们听起来再也不会像他先前作为一名街头混混时创作的那般生动鲜活了。

### Still D.R.E.歌词：

Yea nigga  
Still f**kin wichya  
Still waters run deep  
Still Snoop Dogg and D-R-E '99 Nigga  
Still still doing that shit huh Dre  
Oh for sho' check me out  
It's still Dre Day nigga A K nigga  
Though I've grown a lot can't keep it home a lot  
Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock  
You hear the bass from the trunk when I'm on the block  
Ladies they pay homage but haters say Dre fell off  
How nigga My last album was The Chronic  
They want to know if he still got it  
They say rap's changed they want to know how I feel about it  
If you ain't up on pace  
Dr Dre is the name I'm ahead of my game  
Still puffing my leafs still f**k with the beats  
Still not loving police  
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease  
Still got love for the streets repping 213  
Still the beats bang still doing my thang  
Since I left ain't too much changed still  
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world  
Hitting them corners in them low low's girl  
Still taking my time to perfect the beat  
And I still got love for the streets it's the D-R-E  
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world  
Hitting them corners in them low low's girl  
Still taking my time to perfect the beat  
And I still got love for the streets it's the D-R-E  
Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends  
Well hell me and Snoop we dipping again  
Kept my ear to the streets signed Eminem  
He's triple platinum doing 50 a week  
Still stay close to the heat  
And even when I was close to defeat I rose to my feet  
My life is like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat  
Treat my rap like Cali weed I smoke til I sleep  
Wake up in the A M compose a beat  
I bring the fire til you're soaking in your seat  
It's not a fluke it's been tried I'm the troop  
It's Turn Out the Lights from the World Class Wreckin' Cru  
I'm still at it After-mathematic  
In the home of drivebys and ak-matics  
Swap meets sticky green and bad traffic  
I dip through then I get skin D-R-E  
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world  
Hitting them corners in them low low's girl  
Still taking my time to perfect the beat  
And I still got love for the streets it's the D-R-E  
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world,still  
Hitting them corners in them low low's girl  
Still taking my time to perfect the beat  
And I still got love for the streets it's the D-R-E  
It ain't nothing but more hot shit  
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with  
Whether you're cooling on a corner with your fly bitch  
Laid back in the shack play this track  
I'm representing for the gangstas all across the world  
Still （Hitting them corners in them low low's girl）  
I'll break your neck damn near put your face in your lap  
Niggas try to be the king but the ace is back  
So if you ain't up on thangs  
Dr Dre be the name still running the game  
Still got it wrapped like a mummy  
Still ain't tripping love to see young blacks get money  
Spend time out the hood take they moms out the hood  
Hit my boys off with jobs no more living hard  
Barbeques every day driving fancy cars  
Still gon' get mine regardless  
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world  
Hitting them corners in them low low's girl  
Still taking my time to perfect the beat  
And I still got love for the streets it's the D-R-E  
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world  
Hitting them corners in them low low's girl  
Still taking my time to perfect the beat  
And I still got love for the streets it's the D-R-E  
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world  
Hitting them corners in them low low's girl  
Still taking my time to perfect the beat  
And I still got love for the streets it's the D-R-E  
Like that right back up in ya motherf**king ass  
'95 plus four pennies!  
Add that shit up D-R-E right back up on top of thangs  
Smoke some with your dog  
No stress no seeds no stems no sticks!  
Some of that real sticky icky icky  
Oooh wee! Put it in the air  
Oh you's a fool D R
