### Christmas Time歌词：

We waited all through the year  
For the day to appear  
We could be together in harmony  
You know the time will come  
Peace on earth for everyone  
And we can live forever  
In a world where we are free  
Let it shine for you and me  
There's something about Christmas time  
Something about Christmas time  
That makes you wish it was Christmas everyday  
To see the joy in the children's eyes  
The way that the old folks smile  
Says that Christmas will never go away  
We're all as one tonight  
Makes no difference if you're black or white  
'Cause we can sing together in harmony  
I know it's not too late  
The world would be a better place  
If we can keep the spirit  
More than one day in the year  
Send a message loud and clear  
There's something about Christmas time  
Something about Christmas time  
That makes you wish it was Christmas everyday  
To see the joy in the children's eyes  
The way that the old folks smile  
Says that Christmas will never go away  
It's the time of year when everyone's together  
We'll celebrate here on Christmas day  
When the ones you love are there  
You can feel the magic in the air  
You know it's everywhere  
There's something about Christmas time  
There's something about Christmas time  
There's something about Christmas time  
There's something about Christmas time  
That makes you wish it was Christmas every day  
To see the joy in the children's eyes  
The way that the old folks smile  
Says that Christmas will never go away  
Something about Christmas time  
Something about Christmas time  
That makes you wish it was Christmas everyday  
To see the joy in the children's eyes  
The way that the old folks smile  
Says that Christmas will never go away  
Please tell me Christmas will never go away
