### Girls歌词：

Her name is Lara we learned a lot ah  
How to do it like we do it like we wanna  
We just know

I'm fifty fifty and I'm never gonna hide it  
You should know eh

In the summer haze hush lovin'  
And last night yeah we got with the dude

Red wine I just wanna kiss girls girls girls  
Sometimes I just wanna kiss girls girls girls
