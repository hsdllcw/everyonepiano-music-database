### Don't You Remember歌词：

When will I see you again?  
我何时才能再与你相见  
You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said  
你不辞而别 一言未发  
No final kiss to seal anything  
没有封存一切的吻别  
I had no idea of the state we were in.  
我们的处境让我毫无头绪  
I know I have a fickle heart and bitterness  
我知道我有一颗变化无常的心 还有心痛  
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head  
还有看不透一切的双目 放不下一切的双手  
But don't you remember, don't you remember?  
但你难道不记得 难道你忘记了  
The reason you loved me before,  
之前你爱我的理由  
Baby please remember me once more.  
BABY请再一次记得你爱的我  
When was the last time you thought of me?  
上一次想到我是什么时候  
Or have you completely erased me from your memories?  
难道你真的将我从记忆中抹去  
Cause I often think about where I happen to roam.  
因为我经常不知我该去何处方能见你  
the more I do, the less I know.  
多的再多 却都没有结果  
But I know I have a fickle heart and bitterness  
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head.  
But don't you remember, don't you remember?  
The reason you loved me before,  
Baby please remember me once more.  
Ohhhh  
I gave you the space so you could breathe,  
我给你足够的空间透气  
I kept my distance so you would be free,  
我离你远远的 让你不觉压抑  
I hope that you find the missing piece to bring you back to me.  
我希望你能找到爱情遗失的那一片 将你重新带回我的身边  
Why don't you remember, don't you remember?  
可为什么你不记得  
The reason you loved me before,  
你之前爱我的理由  
Baby please remember you used to love me.  
BABY 为什么忘记你曾经爱过我  
When will I see you again?  
何时 才能与你相见
