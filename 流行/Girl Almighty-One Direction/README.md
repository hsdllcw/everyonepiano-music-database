### Girl Almighty歌词：

(Hey hey, Oh no no)  
Her light is as loud as as many ambulances  
As it takes to save a savior (whoa whoa whoa)  
She floats through the room on a big balloon  
Some say, "She's such a fake"  
That her love is made up  
No, no no no  
Let's have another toast to the girl almighty  
Let's pray we stay young  
Stay made of lightning  
Am I the only,  
Only believer?  
There's something happening here  
The only  
Only believer  
(There's something happening here,  
I hope you feel what I'm feeling too)  
I get down, I get down, I get down  
On my knees for ya  
I get down, I get down, I get down  
On my knees  
I get down on my knees for you  
Her light is as loud as as many ambulances  
As it takes to save a savior (whoa whoa whoa)  
She floats through the room on a big balloon  
Some say, "She's such a fake"  
That her love is made up  
No, no no no  
Let's have another toast to the girl almighty  
Let's pray we stay young  
Stay made of lightning  
Am I the only,  
Only believer?  
There's something happening here  
The only  
Only believer  
(There's something happening here,  
I hope you feel what I'm feeling too)  
I get down, I get down, I get down  
On my knees for ya  
I get down, I get down, I get down  
On my knees  
I get down on my knees for you
