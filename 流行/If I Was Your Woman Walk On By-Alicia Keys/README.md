**If I Was Your Woman/Walk On By双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_If I Was Your Woman/Walk On By_ 出自歌手Alicia Keys的专辑《The Diary of Alicia
Keys》。专辑名称部分缘由来自于Alicia平常写日记的习惯，她认为写日记跟音乐创作都能让她坦然面对真正的自我，而她也希望能够让歌迷透过这些歌曲看到她真正的内心世界，就像在阅读她的日记一样。此外，Alicia认为每隔一段时间回顾一下之前所写的日记，会让人客观地发现自己的成长痕迹；而无论歌词内容或是音乐编排都显得更为成熟的这张专辑，同样也反应出Alicia的成长纪录。Alicia尽情地展示着自己各方面的音乐才华，她是以音乐为生的，以创作和表演音乐来为她的生活带来快乐，也正是这样的状态才使Alicia和她的音乐能够近乎完美的结合在一起，令听者陶醉在其中。

### If I Was Your Woman/Walk On By歌词：

[Verse I:]

If I was your woman  
And you were my man  
You'd have no other woman  
You'd be weak as a lamb  
If you had the strength  
To walk out my door  
My love would over rule my sense  
And I'd call you back for more

[Chorus:]

If I was your woman  
If I was your woman  
If I was your woman  
If I was your woman  
And you were my man, yeah

[Verse II:]

She tears you down darlin  
Says you're nothing at all  
But I'll pick you up darlin  
When she lets you fall cause  
You're like a diamond  
But she treats you like glass  
Yet you beg her to love you  
But me you won't ask

[Chorus:]

If I were your woman  
If I was your woman  
If I were your woman  
If I was your woman  
If I were your woman  
If I was your woman  
Here's what I'd do  
I'd never, never no no  
Stop loving you, yeah

[Verse III:]

Life is so crazy  
And love is unkind  
Because she was first darlin'  
Will she hang on your mind?  
You're part of me  
But you don't even know it  
I'm what you need  
But I'm too afraid to show it

[Chorus:]

If I were your woman  
If I was your woman  
If I were your woman  
If I was your woman  
If I were your woman  
If I was your woman  
Here's what I'd do  
I'd never, never no no  
Stop loving you, yeah  
If I was your woman  
Here's what I'd do  
I'd never, never, never  
Stop loving you, yeah

[Bridge:]

If I were your woman  
If I were your woman  
If I was your woman  
If I was your woman  
If I were your woman
