### Empty Space歌词：

I don't see you  
You're not in every window I look through  
And I don't miss you  
You're not in every single thing I do  
I don't think we're meant to be  
And you are not the missing piece  
I won't hear it  
Whenever anybody says your name  
And I won't feel it  
Even when I'm burstin' into flames  
I don't regret the day I left  
I don't believe that I was blessed  
I'm probably lyin' to myself again  
I'm alone in my head  
Looking for love in a stranger's bed  
But I don't think I'll find it  
'Cause only you could fill this empty space  
I wanna tell all my friends  
But I don't think they would understand  
It's somethin' l've decided  
'Cause only you could fill this empty space  
Space space  
This empty space  
Space space  
This  
'Cause only you could fill this empty space  
I've been drinking  
I've been doin' things I shouldn't do  
Overthinking  
I don't know who I am without you  
I'm a liar and a cheat  
I let my ego swallow me  
And that's why I may never see you again  
I'm alone in my head  
Looking for love in a stranger's bed  
But I don't think I'll find it  
'Cause only you could fill this empty space  
I wanna tell all my friends  
But I don't think they would understand  
It's somethin' l've decided  
'Cause only you could fill this empty space  
Space space  
This empty space  
Space space  
This  
'Cause only you could fill this empty space  
How could I make you love me  
How could I make you love me  
How could I make you love me  
How could I make you love me  
How could I make you love me  
How could I make you love me  
How could I make you love me space space  
How could I make you love me  
How could I make you love me  
How could I make you love me space space  
How could I make you love me  
How could I make you love me  
How could I make you love me  
How could I make you love me
