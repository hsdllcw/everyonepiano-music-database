Wicked Games歌词：

  
I left my girl back home  
I don't love her no more  
And she'll never fucking know that  
These fucking eyes that I'm staring at  
Let me see that ass  
Look at all this cash  
And I emptied out my cards too  
Now I'm fucking leaning on that

Bring your love baby I could bring my shame  
Bring the drugs baby I could bring my pain  
I got my heart right here  
I got my scars right here  
Bring the cups baby I could bring the drink  
Bring your body baby I could bring you fame  
And that's my motherfucking words too  
Just let me motherfucking love you

Listen ma I'll give you all I got  
Get me off of this  
I need confidence in myself  
Listen ma I'll give you all of me  
Give me all of it  
I need all of it to myself

So tell me you love me  
Only for tonight  
Only for the night  
Even though you don't love me  
Just tell me you love me  
I'll give you what I need  
I'll give you all of me  
Even though you don't love me

Let me see you dance  
I love to watch you dance  
Take you down another level  
Get you dancing with the devil  
Take a shot of this  
But I'm warning you  
I'm on that shit that you can't smell baby  
So put down your perfume

Bring your love baby I could bring my shame  
Bring the drugs baby I could bring my pain  
I got my heart right here  
I got my scars right here  
Bring the cups baby I could bring the drink  
Bring your body baby I could bring you fame  
And that's my motherfucking words too  
So let me motherfucking love you

Listen ma I'll give you all I got  
Get me off of this  
I need confidence in myself  
Listen ma I'll give you all of me  
Give me all of it  
I need all of it to myself

So tell me you love me  
Only for tonight  
Only for one night  
Even though you don't love me  
Just tell me you love me  
I'll give you what I need  
I'll give you all of me  
Even though you don't love me
