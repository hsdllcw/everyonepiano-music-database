**Passionfruit双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Passionfruit_ 出自加拿大说唱男歌手Drake的录音室专辑《More Life》。与其他Hip
Hop艺人相比，Drake唱片中“唱”的成分会多很多，Drake也自诩为“首个说唱俱佳的歌手”。他的音乐对Hip
Hop有颠覆，风格更贴近流行“歌曲”，无疑更容易被大众接纳。有乐迷就称他为“说唱界的泰勒•斯威夫特”。

### Passionfruit歌词：

[Moodymann:]  
Hold on, hold on, fuck that  
Fuck that shit  
Hold on, I got to start this mothafuckin' record over again, wait a minute  
Fuck that shit  
Still on this mothafuckin' record  
I'ma play this mothafucka for y'all  
Ay, y'all get some more drinks goin' on, I'll sound a whole lot better  
[Drake:]  
Listen, seeing you got ritualistic  
Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now  
Cause I'm fallin' apart  
Yeah, tension between us just like picket fences  
You got issues that I won't mention for now  
Cause we're fallin' apart  
Passionate from miles away  
Passive with the things you say  
Passin' up on my old ways  
I can't blame you, no, no  
Passionate from miles away  
Passive with the things you say  
Passin' up on my old ways  
I can't blame you, no, no  
Listen, hard at buildin' trust from a distance  
I think we should rule out commitment for now  
Cause we're fallin' apart  
Leavin', you're just doing that to get even  
Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now  
They keep fallin' apart  
Passionate from miles away  
Passive with the things you say  
Passin' up on my old ways  
I can't blame you, no, no  
Passionate from miles away  
Passive with the things you say  
Passin' up on my old ways  
I can't blame you, no, no  
[Girl on phone:]  
Trying to think of the right thing to say
