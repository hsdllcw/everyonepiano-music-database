### Thinkin Bout You歌词：

A tornado flew around my room before you came  
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain  
In Southern California, much like Arizona  
My eyes don't shed tears, but, boy, they bawl

When I'm thinkin' 'bout you  
(Ooh, no, no, no)  
I've been thinkin' 'bout you  
(You know, know, know)  
I've been thinkin' 'bout you  
Do you think about me still?  
Do ya, do ya?

Or do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)  
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

Or do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)  
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool  
Enough to kick it  
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho  
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute  
That's why I kiss you  
Got a fighter jet, I don't get fly it, though

I'm lyin' down thinkin' 'bout you  
(Ooh, no, no, no)  
I've been thinkin' 'bout you  
(You know, know, know)  
I've been thinkin' 'bout you  
Do you think about me still?  
Do ya, do ya?

Or do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)  
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

Or do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)  
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

Yes, of course  
I remember, how could I forget?  
How you feel?  
And though you were my first time  
A new feel  
It won't ever get old, not in my soul  
Not in my spirit, keep it alive  
We'll go down this road  
'Til it turns from color to black and white

Or do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)  
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

Or do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)  
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)
