### Somebody That I Used to Know歌词：

Now and then I think of when we were together  
偶尔想起那一起的日子  
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die  
仿佛还是你快乐至极的时刻  
Told myself that you were right for me  
告诉自己 你就是我想要的  
But felt so lonely in your company  
可是有了你的陪伴 并没有减少我的孤单  
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember  
那就是爱 就是那忘不掉的疼  
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness  
对于某个伤痛都会沉迷的你  
Like resignation to the end  
最后却好像无可奈何  
Always the end  
总是这样到最后  
So when we found that we could not make sense  
所以当我们感情也平淡的时候  
Well you said that we would still be friends  
你会说我们还是朋友吧  
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over  
我承认我愿意结束这样的感情  
But you didn't have to cut me off  
可是你不必这样远离我  
Make out like it never happened  
好像我们曾经什么也没有过  
And that we were nothing  
好像我们从不曾来过  
And I don't even need your love  
我甚至可以不需要你的爱  
But you treat me like a stranger  
可是你却视我如路人  
And that feels so rough  
我是如此难过  
You didn't have to stoop so low  
你不必如此躲开我  
Have your friends collect your records  
你的朋友整理了你的讯息了么  
And then change your number  
改变了你的号码了么  
I guess that I don't need that though  
我想我不必在有这样那样的想法了  
Now you're just somebody that I used to know  
现在的你只是我曾经认识的某某而已  
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over  
偶尔想起所有缠绵的日子  
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done  
可是让我相信的我们曾经的事 也只有它  
And I don't wanna live that way  
我不想再要那样的生活  
Reading into every word you say  
看穿你说的每句话  
You said that you could let it go  
你说你可以放手  
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know...  
我不会再看到你徘徊在你曾经的过去  
But you didn't have to cut me off  
可是你不必这样远离我  
Make out like it never happened  
好像我们曾经什么也没有过  
And that we were nothing  
好像我们从不曾来过  
And I don't even need your love  
我甚至可以不需要你的爱  
But you treat me like a stranger  
可是你却视我如路人  
And that feels so rough  
我是如此难过  
You didn't have to stoop so low  
你不必如此躲开我  
Have your friends collect your records  
你的朋友整理了你的讯息了么  
And then change your number  
改变了你的号码了么  
I guess that I don't need that though  
我想我不必在有这样那样的想法了  
Now you're just somebody that I used to know  
现在的你只是我曾经认识的某某而已  
I used to know  
我曾经认识的  
That I used to know  
那个我曾经认识的  
Somebody...
