### Too Much To Ask歌词：

Waiting here for someone  
Only yesterday we were on the run  
You smile back at me and your face lit up the sun  
Now I'm waiting here for someone  
And oh love do you feel this rough  
Why's it only you I'm thinking of  
My shadow's dancing  
Without you for the first time  
My heart is hoping  
You'll walk right in tonight  
Tell me there are things that you regret  
'Cause if I'm being honest I ain't over you yet  
It's all I'm asking  
Is it too much to ask  
Is it too much to ask  
Someone's moving outside  
The lights come on and down the drive  
I forget you're not here when I close my eyes  
Do you still think of me sometimes  
And oh love watch the sun coming up  
Don't it feel messed up we're not in love  
My shadow's dancing  
Without you for the first time  
My heart is hoping  
You'll walk right in tonight  
Tell me there are things that you regret  
'Cause if I'm being honest I ain't over you yet  
It's all I'm asking  
Is it too much to ask  
My shadow's dancing  
Without you for the first time  
My heart is hoping  
You'll walk right in tonight  
Tell me there are things that you regret  
'Cause if I'm being honest I ain't over you yet  
My shadow's dancing  
Without you for the first time  
My heart is hoping  
You'll walk right in tonight  
Tell me there are things that you regret  
'Cause if I'm being honest I ain't over you yet  
It's all I'm asking  
Is it too much to ask  
It's all I'm asking  
Is it too much to ask  
It's all I'm asking  
Is it too much to ask
