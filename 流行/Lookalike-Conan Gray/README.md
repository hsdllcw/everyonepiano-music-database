### Lookalike歌词：

Let's go back to the Summer night  
When we met eyes it's like a movie line  
Kissin' underneath the city lights  
But now you're laying in another guy's arms  
'Cause I'm all gone  
But when you look in his eyes  
Do you think of mine  
And when you look at that smile  
Do I 'cross your mind  
I know in your head  
You see me instead  
'Cause he looks a lot like I did back then  
Baby don't lie  
He's just a lookalike  
Can't redo what's already done  
Can't compete 'cause I've already won  
Sayin' this time it's really love  
But honey you're not fooling anyone  
Don't you know we're done  
But when you look in his eyes  
Do you think of mine  
And when you look at that smile  
Do I 'cross your mind  
I know in your head  
You see me instead  
'Cause he looks a lot like I did back then  
Baby don't lie lie  
He's just a lookalike  
And I'll admit that I sometimes maybe might  
Think about you at night well almost every night  
No matter how I try to hide  
And erase you from my mind  
I'm dying  
To find a lookalike  
'Cause when you look in his eyes  
Hope you think of mine  
And when you look at that smile  
Hope I 'cross your mind  
I hope in your head  
You see me instead  
'Cause you've been in mine every day since then  
Maybe it's time to find a lookalike  
No I can't lie  
I need a lookalike
