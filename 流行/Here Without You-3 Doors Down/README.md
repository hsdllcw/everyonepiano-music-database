**Here Without You** 是美国摇滚乐队3 Doors Down所演唱的一首歌曲。收录在其专辑Away From The Sun中。

这张专集无疑比《The Better
Life》更进了一步，专集发行不到一周便登上了Billboard排名前200中的第8名！并且在一个月之内就达到了黄金销量，而后又突破了白金销量。当然这都得归功于其中非常成功的单曲When
I'm Gone。还有专集里著名单曲“ _Here Without You_ ”也连续创入美国Billboard排行榜前40名13周之久。

### Here Without You歌词：

A hundred days have made me older  
Since the last time that I saw your pretty face  
A thousand lies have made me colder  
And I don't think I can look at this the same

But all the miles that separate  
Disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face

I'm here without you, baby  
But you're still on my lonely mind  
I think about you, baby  
And I dream about you all the time  
I'm here without you, baby

But you're still with me in my dreams  
And tonight it's only you and me, yeah.

The miles just keep rollin'  
As the people leave their way to say hello  
I've heard this life is overrated  
But I hope that it gets better as we go, oh, yeah, yeah

I'm here without you, baby  
But you're still on my lonely mind  
I think about you, baby  
And I dream about you all the time  
I'm here without you, baby

But you're still with me in my dreams  
And tonight, girl, its only you and me

Everything I know, and anywhere I go (oh whoa)  
It gets hard but it won't take away my love (oh whoa)  
And when the last one falls  
When it's all said and done  
It gets hard but it wont take away my love, whoa, oh, oh

I'm here without you, baby  
But you're still on my lonely mind  
I think about you, baby  
And I dream about you all the time  
I'm here without you, baby

But you're still with me in my dreams  
And tonight, girl, it's only you and me
