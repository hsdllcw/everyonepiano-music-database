### Find You歌词：

I look for you in the center of the sun  
I took a pill but it didn't help me numb  
I see your face even when my eyes are shut  
But I never really know just where to find you  
I taste the words that keep falling out your mouth  
You got a logic I can never figure out  
If I could hold you then I'd never put you down  
But I never really know just where to find you  
Where to find you  
Where to find you  
But I never really know just where to find you  
Try try try but I  
Try try try but I but I  
Try try try but I  
But I never really know just where to find you  
You think you know how to get under my skin  
It's okay for now but it's never permanent  
Knock on the door but there's no one listening  
And I never really know just where to find you  
You live for love but you never really try  
You say it's not but it's always on your mind  
Keep chasing gold but you're used to silver lines  
But I never really know just where to find you  
Where to find you  
Where to find you  
But I never really know just where to find you  
Try try try but I  
Try try try but I but I  
Try try try but I  
But I never really know just where to find you  
Bad idea I'm chasing a feeling  
Bad idea I don't even need it  
Bad idea looking for me tonight tonight  
I look for you in the center of the sun  
I took a pill but it didn't help me numb  
I see your face even when my eyes are shut  
But I never really know just where to find you  
Where to find you  
Where to find you  
But I never really know just where to find you  
Try try try but I  
Try try try but I but I  
Try try try but I  
But I never really know just where to find you
