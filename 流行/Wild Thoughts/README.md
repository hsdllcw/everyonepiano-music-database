### Wild Thoughts歌词：

Another one  
We The Best music  
DJ Khaled  
I don't know if you could take it  
Know you wanna see me nakey, nakey, naked  
I wanna be your baby, baby, baby  
Spinning and it's wet just like it came from Maytag  
White girl wasted on that brown liquor  
When I get like this I can't be around you  
I'm too lit to dim down a notch  
'Cause I could name some thangs that I'm gon' do  
Wild, wild, wild  
Wild, wild, wild thoughts  
Wild, wild, wild  
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts  
Wild, wild, wild  
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts  
Let's go!  
I hope you know I'm for the takin'  
You know this cookie is for the baking  
Kitty, kitty, baby, give that thing some rest  
'Cause you done beat it like the '68 Jets  
Diamonds ain't nothing when I'm rockin' with ya  
Diamonds ain't nothing when I'm shinin' with ya  
Just keep it white and black as if I'm ya sister  
I'm too hip to hop around town out here with ya  
I know I get  
Wild, wild, wild  
Wild, wild, wild thoughts  
Wild, wild, wild  
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts  
Wild, wild, wild  
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts  
Ayy, ugh, ugh, I heard that pussy for the taking  
I heard it got these other niggas goin' crazy  
Yeah, I treat you like a lady, lady  
Fuck you 'til you're burned out, cremation (burned out)  
Make it cream, yeah, Wu-Tang  
Throw that ass back, bouquet  
Call me and I can get it juicy  
I can tell you're gone off the D'usse  
Careful, mama, watch what you say  
You talking to me like ya new bae  
Girl, You talking like you tryna do things  
Now that pipe got her running like she Usain, baby  
You made me drown in it, ooh, touche, baby  
I'm carrying that water, Bobby Boucher, baby  
And you know I'mma slaughter like I'm Jason  
Bust it, why you got it on safety?  
White girl wasted on brown liquor  
I probably shouldn't be around you  
'Cause you get wild, wild, wild  
You looking like there's nothing that you won't do  
Ayy, girl, that's when I told you  
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts  
Wild, wild, wild  
Wild, wild, wild thoughts  
Wild, wild, wild  
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts  
Wild, wild, wild  
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts  
DJ Khaled!  
Wild, wild, wild  
Wild, wild, wild  
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts
