_Fake Happy_ 是美国乐队Paramore的歌曲。Poramore的歌曲总能抵达心扉，有时不需要太多语言，一首歌也足够可以表达我的感情。

可能每个人都会有这种感受，因社会的缘故，我们都自欺欺人的大笑，我们用精湛的演技去骗过他们，即使，我们其实并不开心。但，我们又不得不不如此。这便是我们-

### Fake Happy歌词：

I love making you believe  
What you get is what you see  
But I'm so fake happy  
I feel so fake happy  
And I bet everybody here  
Is just as insincere  
We're all so fake happy  
And I know fake happy  
I been doing a good job of makin' 'em think  
I'm quite alright  
But I hope I don't blink  
You see it's easy when I'm stomping on a beat  
But no one sees me when I crawl back underneath  
If I smile with my teeth  
Bet you believe me  
If I smile with my teeth  
I think I believe me  
Oh please don't ask me how I've been  
Don't make me play pretend  
Oh no oh what's the use  
Oh please I bet everybody here is fake happy too  
And if I go out tonight dress up my fears  
You think I'll look alright with these mascara tears  
See I'm gonna draw my lipstick wider than my mouth  
And if the lights are low they'll never see me frown  
If I smile with my teeth  
Bet you believe me  
If I smile with my teeth  
I think I believe me  
Oh please don't ask me how I've been  
Don't make me play pretend  
Oh no oh oh what's the use  
Oh please I bet everybody here is fake happy too  
I know I said that I was doing good and that I'm happy now  
Oh oh  
I should've known that when things are going good that's when I get knocked
down  
Oh please just don't ask me how I've been  
Don't make me play pretend  
Oh no oh no  
Oh what's the use  
Oh please I bet everybody here is fake happy too  
Oh please I bet everybody here is fake happy too
