### Heartbreak Anthem歌词：

Hello it's me your ex  
I called to say not sorry but I wish you the best  
And I don't hold no grudges promise this ain't a test  
We okay we okay  
Sometimes it works out but sometimes it don't  
Maybe we'll fix this or maybe we won't  
Sometimes a heart can sink like a stone  
Until you find home  
This ain't a heartbreak anthem  
I don't care what happened  
But I ain't got no time to dwell on it  
Don't wanna throw a tantrum  
You did what you had to  
No I ain't got no time to dwell on it  
And I don't wanna feel I don't wanna feel hollow  
Chasin' you and me chasin' all of these shadows  
This ain't a heartbreak anthem  
I don't care what happened  
But I ain't got no time to dwell on it  
This ain't a heartbreak anthem  
Ooh  
This ain't a heartbreak this ain't a heartbreak  
This ain't a heartbreak anthem  
A heartbreak anthem a heartbreak anthem  
Ain't a heartbreak  
Hello it's me your ex  
I didn't wanna call but there's this pain in my chest  
And thanks to you I'm wearing out this bulletproof vest  
But I'll be okay  
Okay  
I'm okay  
I'm okay  
Sometimes it works out but sometimes it don't  
Maybe we'll fix this or maybe we won't  
Sometimes a heart can sink like a stone  
Until you find home  
This ain't a heartbreak anthem  
No  
I don't care what happened  
But I ain't got no time to dwell on it  
Time to dwell on it oh  
Don't wanna throw a tantrum  
You did what you had to  
No I ain't got no time to dwell on it  
And I don't wanna feel I don't wanna feel hollow  
Chasin' you and me chasin' all of these shadows  
This ain't a heartbreak anthem  
I don't care what happened  
But I ain't got no time to dwell on it  
This ain't a heartbreak anthem  
Ooh  
This ain't a heartbreak this ain't a heartbreak  
This ain't a heartbreak anthem  
A heartbreak anthem a heartbreak anthem  
Ain't a heartbreak  
And I don't wanna feel I don't wanna feel hollow  
Chasin' you and me chasin' all of these shadows  
This ain't a heartbreak anthem  
I don't care what happened  
But I ain't got no time to dwell on it
