### Remember That Night歌词：

The day after you said "Goodbye"  
All I did was lay in bed and cry  
But after one month I started to move on  
And after two I felt alright  
Then three months in you were off my mind  
And month four and five I was living my life  
I was better and didn't have to try  
Not to think of you until you reached out and said  
"Remember that night"  
We went for a drive 2:30 in the morning  
I kissed you it was pouring  
We held each other tight  
Before the night was over  
You looked over your shoulder  
Oh I was doing fine  
You said "Remember that night  
Remember that night"  
Oh I was doing fine  
You said "Remember that night  
Remember that night"  
The day after you had reached out  
I was broken for the second time around  
I prayed on the third day that I would be okay  
That I'd forget you were ever mine  
Oh I don't think you realize  
How long I had to fight to be living my life  
To get better and never have to try  
Not to think of you until you reached out and said  
"Remember that night"  
We went for a drive 2:30 in the morning  
I kissed you it was pouring  
We held each other tight  
Before the night was over  
You looked over your shoulder  
Oh I was doing fine  
You said "Remember that night  
Remember that night"  
Oh I was doing fine  
You said "Remember that night  
Remember that night"  
Do you remember  
Remember  
We went for a drive 2:30 in the morning  
I kissed you it was pouring  
We held each other tight  
Before the night was over  
You looked over your shoulder  
Oh I was doing fine  
You said "Remember that night  
Remember that night"  
Oh I was doing fine  
You said "Remember that night  
Remember that night"  
Do you remember  
Remember
