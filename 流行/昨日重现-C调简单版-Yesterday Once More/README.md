### 昨日重现歌词：

When I was young  
I'd listen to the radio  
Waiting for my favorite songs  
When they played I'd sing along  
It made me smile  
Those were such happy times  
And not so long ago  
How I wondered where they'd gone  
But they're back again  
Just like a long lost friend  
All the songs I loved so well  
Every shalalala  
Every wo wo oh  
Still shines  
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling  
That they're starting to sing's  
So fine  
When they get to the part  
Where he's breaking her heart  
It can really make me cry  
Just like before  
It's yesterday once more  
Shoobidoo wangdang  
Shoobidoo wangdang  
Looking back on how it was  
In years gone by  
And the good times that I had  
Makes today seem rather sad  
So much has changed  
It was songs of love that  
I would sing to then  
And I'd memorize each word  
Those old melodies  
Still sound so good to me  
As they melt the years away  
Every shalalala  
Every wo wo oh  
Still shines  
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling  
That they're starting to sing's  
So fine  
All my best memories  
Come back clearly to me  
Some can even make me cry  
Just like before  
It's yesterday once more  
Shoobidoo wangdang  
Every shalalala  
Every wo wo oh  
Still shines  
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling  
That they're starting to sing's  
So fine  
Every shalalala  
Every wo wo oh  
Still shines  
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling  
That they're starting to sing's
