### Time of Our Lives歌词：

[Ne-Yo:]  
I knew my rent was gon' be late about a week ago  
I worked my ass off, but I still can't pay it though  
But I got just enough  
To get off in this club  
Hand me a good time, before my time is up  
Hey, let's get it now

Oooh I want the time of my life (Mr. Worldwide!)  
Oh baby  
Oooh give me the time of my life (Ne-Yo, let's get it!)  
Let's get it now

[Verse 1 - Pitbull:]  
This is the last $20 I got  
But I'm a have a good time ballin' on that  
Tell the bartender line up some shots  
Cause I'm a get loose tonight  
She's on fire, she's so hot  
I'm no liar, she burned the spot  
Looked like Mariah, I took another shot  
Told her drop, drop, drop, drop it like it's hot  
Dirty talk, dirty dance  
She a freaky girl and I'm a freaky man  
She on the rebound, broke up with her ex  
And I'm like Rodman, ready on deck  
I told her I wanna ride out, and she said yes  
We didn't go to church, but I got blessed

[Pre-Chorus - Ne-Yo:]  
I knew my rent was gon' be late about a week ago  
I worked my ass off, but I still can't pay it though  
But I got just enough  
To get up in this club  
Hand me a good time, before my time is up  
Hey, let's get it now

[Chorus - Ne-Yo:]  
Oooh I want the time of my life, yeah...  
Ohh baby  
Oooh give me the time of my life  
Hey, hey, hey  
Let's get it now

[Verse 2 - Pitbull:]  
Tonight I'm a lose my mind  
Better get yours cause I'm gonna get mine  
Party every night like my last  
Mommy know the drill, shake that ass  
Go ahead baby let me see what you got  
You know you got the biggest booty in this spot  
And I just wanna see that thing drop  
From the back to the front to the top  
You know me I'm off in the cut  
Always like a Squirrel, looking for a nut  
This isn't for show I'm not talking 'bout luck  
I'm not talking 'bout love, I'm talking 'bout lust  
Now let's get loose, have some fun  
Forget about bills and the first of the month  
It's my night, your night, our night, let's turn it up

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge - Ne-Yo:]  
Everybody going through something  
(Everybody going through something)  
I said, everybody going through something  
(Everybody going through something)  
So you might as well roll it up  
Pour it up, drink it up, throw it up tonight... ohhh, yeah  
I said, everybody going through something  
(Everybody going through something)  
Said, everybody going through something  
(Everybody going through something)  
So you might as well roll it up  
Pour it up, drink it up, throw it up tonight... ohhh, yeah

[Verse 3 - Pitbull:]  
This for anybody going through tough times  
Believe me, been there, done that  
But everyday above ground is a great day, remember that

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
