### Since U Been Gone歌词：

Here's the thing  
We started out friends  
It was cool but it was all pretend  
Yeah yeah since you been gone  
Your dedicated you took the time  
Wasn't long til I called you mine  
Yeah yeah since you been gone  
And all you'd ever hear me say  
Is how I pictured me with you  
That's all you'd ever hear me say  
But since you been gone  
I can breath for the first time  
I'm so moving on yeah yeah  
Thanks to you now I get what I want  
Since you been gone  
How can I put it You put me on  
I even fell for that stupid love song  
Yeah yeah since you been gone  
How come I'd never hear you say  
I just wanna be with you  
Guess you never felt that way  
But since you been gone  
I can breath for the first time  
I'm so moving on yeah yeah  
Thanks to you now I get  
I get what I want  
Since you been gone  
You had your chance you blew it  
Out of sight out of mind  
Shut your mouth I just can't take it  
Again and again and again and again  
Since you been gone （since you been gone）  
I can breath for the first time  
I'm so moving on yeah yeah  
Thanks to you （thanks to you）  
Now I get I get what I want  
I can breath for the first time  
I'm so moving on yeah yeah  
Thanks to you （thanks to you）  
Now I get （I get）  
You should know （you should know）  
That I get I get what I want  
Since you been gone  
Since you been gone  
Since you been gone
