《 **People Watching** 》是柯南•格雷（Conan
Gray）于2021年7月15日发行的一首单曲，收录在其第二张专辑《Superache》。这首歌充分展现了他优秀的唱功和作词作曲能力。

初听感觉主歌和副歌有断节之感，带着歌词再听一遍，副歌简直是整首歌最精彩之处，和主歌融合的很好。主歌是柯南•格雷擅长的叙述性歌词，副歌则如同突然爆发的火山，情感迸发似激流。一口气听下来，心灵仿佛有了一个情感的宣泄口，畅快淋漓。

### People Watching歌词：

That wasn't funny  
But she laughed so hard she almost cried  
They're countin' months they've been together  
Almost forty-nine  
He's making fun of how she acted around the holidays  
She wears a ring but they tell people that they're not engaged  
They met in class for metaphysical philosophy  
He tells his friends I like her  
'Cause she's so much smarter than me  
They're having talks about their futures until 4AM  
And I'm happy for them  
I'm happy for them  
But I wanna feel all that love and emotion  
Be that attached to the person I'm holdin'  
Some day I'll be falling without caution  
But for now I'm only people watchin'  
I'm only looking just to live through you vicariously  
I've never really been in love not seriously  
I had a dream about a house behind a picket fence  
Next one I choose to trust I hope I use some common sense  
But I cut people out like tags on my clothin'  
I end up all alone but I still keep hopin'  
I wanna feel all that love and emotion  
Be that attached to the person I'm holdin'  
Some day I'll be falling without caution  
But for now I'm only people watchin'  
Cut people out like tags on my clothin'  
I end up all alone but I still keep hopin'  
I won't be scared to let someone know me  
Life feels so monotone but I still keep hopin'  
Cut people out like tags on my clothin'  
I end up all alone but I still keep hopin'  
I won't be scared to let someone know me  
Life feels so monotone but I still keep hopin'  
I feel love emotion  
I wanna feel all that love and emotion  
Be that attached to the person I'm holdin'  
Some day I'll be falling without caution  
But for now I'm only people watchin'
