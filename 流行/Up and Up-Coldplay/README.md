**Up &Up双手简谱**和五线谱完全对应。

_Up &Up_是摇滚乐队Coldplay的歌曲，收录在其专辑A Head Full Of Dreams中。Coldplay从“Ghost
Stories”的自我沉淀省视后，让灵魂再度蜕变，为生命灌注丰沛的动力，幻化出七彩的美妙光芒，以音乐歌颂生命、赞美人生，愿与宇宙共鸣再回馈给这个世界，反射给每个聆听他们音乐的人，让每个灵魂从中再次得到勇气与活力。“A
Head Full Of Dreams”专辑名称其实早在几年前就已经决定，却迟迟未找到契机创作，一直到现在终于催生，Chris
Martin将此辑比喻为「哈利波特最终章」，也许意指着可能是Coldplay的最后作品，对此Chris
Martin持保留态度，表示他们得要将这张专辑如此定位才能毫不保留地将最好的他们投注其中，因此“A Head Full Of
Dreams”也是Coldplay有史以来最乐在其中、最自豪的。

### Up&Up歌词：

Fixing up a car to drive in it again  
Searching for the water, hoping for the rain  
Up and up  
Up and up

Down upon a canvas, working in a meal  
Waiting for a chance to pick your orange peel  
Up and up  
Up and up

See a pearl form a diamond in the rough  
See a bird soaring high above the flood  
It's in your blood  
It's in your blood

Underneath the storm, an umbrella is saying  
Sitting with the poison takes away the pain  
Up and up  
Up and up, saying

We're gonna get it, get it together right now  
Gonna get it, get it together somehow  
Gonna get it, get it together and float, oh

We're gonna get it, get it together, I know  
Gonna get it, get it together and float  
Gonna get it, get it together and go  
Up and up and up

Lying in the gutter, aiming for the moon  
Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon  
Up and up  
Up and up

How can people suffer? How can people part?  
How can people struggle? How can people  
Break your heart?  
Break your heart, oh

Yes I wanna grow, yes I wanna feel  
Yes I wanna know, show me how to  
Heal it up  
Heal it up, oh

Try and see the forest, there in every seed  
Angels in the marble waiting to be freed  
Just need love  
Just need love

When the going is rough, saying

We're gonna get it, get it together right now  
Gonna get it, get it together somehow  
Gonna get it, get it together and float, oh

We're gonna get it, get it together right no  
Gonna get it, get it together and float  
Gonna get it, get it together and go

'Cause you can say what is, or fight for it  
Close your mind or take a risk  
You can say it's mine and clench your fist  
Or see each sunrise as a gift

We're gonna get it, get it together right now  
Gonna get it, get it together somehow  
Gonna get it, get it together and float, oh

We're gonna get it, get it together right now  
Gonna get it, get it together and float  
Gonna get it, get it together and go  
Up and up and up

We're gonna get it, get it together right now  
Gonna get it, get it together somehow  
Gonna get it, get it together and float, oh

We're gonna get it, get it together right now  
We're gonna get it, get it together and float  
We're gonna get it, get it together and go  
Up and up and up

Oh

Fixing up a car to drive in it again  
When you're in pain, when you think you've had enough  
Don't ever give up  
Don't ever give up  
Believe in love
