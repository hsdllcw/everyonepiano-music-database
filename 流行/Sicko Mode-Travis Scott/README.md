### Sicko Mode歌词：

Drake：  
Astro yeah  
Sun is down freezin' cold  
That's how we already know winter's here  
My dawg would probably do it for a Louis belt  
That's just all he know he don't know nothin' else  
I tried to show 'em yeah  
I tried to show 'em yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Gone on you with the pick and roll  
Young La Flame he in sicko mode  
Travis Scott/The Notorious B.I.G.：  
Woo made this here with all the ice on in the booth  
At the gate outside when they pull up they get me loose  
Yeah Jump Out boys that's Nike boys hoppin' out coupes  
This sh*t way too big  
When we pull up give me the loot  
Gimme the loot  
Was off the Remy had to Papoose  
Had to hit my old town to duck the news  
Two-four hour lockdown we made no moves  
Now it's 4 AM and I'm back up poppin' with the crew  
I just landed in Chase B mix this pop like Jamba Juice  
Different colored chains think my jeweler really sellin' fruits  
And they chokin' man know the crackers wish it was a noose  
Big Hawk/Swae Lee/Travis Scott：  
Some-some-some someone said  
To win the retreat we all in too deep  
P-p-playin' for keeps don't play us for weak someone said  
To win the retreat we all in too deep  
P-p-playin' for keeps don't play us for weak yeah  
Travis Scott/Swae Lee/Luke：  
This sh*t way too formal y'all know I don't follow suit  
Stacey Dash most of these girls ain't got a clue  
All of these h**s I made off records I produced  
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group  
Hit my eses I need the booch  
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo  
Told her hop in you comin' too  
In the 305 b**ches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke  
Don't stop pop that p**sy  
Had to slop the top off it's just a roof uh  
She said where we goin'  
And I said the moon  
We ain't even make it to the room  
She thought it was the ocean it's just the pool  
Now I got her open it's just the Goose  
Who put this sh*t together  
I'm the glue  
Someone said  
Shorty FaceTimed me out the blue  
Big Hawk/Swae Lee：
