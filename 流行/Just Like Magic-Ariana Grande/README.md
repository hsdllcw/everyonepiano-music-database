**Just Like Magic** 是由美国女歌手Ariana Grande录唱的一首歌曲，被收录在Ariana
Grande于2020年10月30日发行的第六张录音室专辑《Positions》。

虚幻律动的节奏令人欲罢不能，富有深意的歌词穿插其中，兼附上A妹独特的唱腔，造就了这首独特的“魔术曲目”。歌曲中间穿插的突然寂静下来的萤火虫在深森中低语的细声让一切都静下来，缓下来。
在这里，Ariana的一天Just Like Magic. 但再有魔力的一天都是要从醒来起床开始。Ariana呼吁大家好好生活！

### Just Like Magic歌词：

Oh yeah  
Wake up in my bed I just wanna have a good day  
Mmm ah  
Think it in my head then it happens how it should ayy  
Twelve o'clock I got a team meeting then a meditation at like 1:30  
Then I'm right to the studio listening to some s**t I wrote  
Oh  
Good karma my aesthetic  
Aesthetic  
Keep my conscious clear that's why I'm so magnetic  
Manifest it  
Yeah  
I finessed it  
I finessed it  
Take my pen and write some love letters to Heaven  
Just like magic  
Baby  
Just like magic  
Oh yeah  
Middle finger to my thumb and then I snap it  
Just like magic  
Yeah  
I'm attractive  
Oh yeah  
I get everything I want 'cause I attract it  
Oh  
Looking at my phone but I'm tryna disconnect it  
Oh yeah  
Read a f**kin' book I be tryna stay connected  
Yeah  
Swear it's tricky at the top  
Gotta keep a slim ego for a thick wallet  
Losing friends left and right  
But I just landed lovin' life  
Oh  
Good karma my aesthetic  
My aesthetic  
Keep my conscious clear that's why I'm so magnetic  
Manifest it  
Ooh  
I finessed it  
Ooh  
Take my pen and write some love letters to Heaven  
Just like magic just like magic  
Middle finger to my thumb and then I snap it  
Ayy  
Just like magic I'm attractive  
I get everything I want 'cause I attract it  
I don't wanna waste your time on some dumb s**t  
"Password to your phone" you can miss me with that s**t  
Redesign your brain we gon' make some new habits  
Just like magic  
Just like magic  
Just like magic  
Just like magic  
Baby  
Just like magic  
Oh  
Middle finger to my thumb and then I snap it  
Just like magic  
Oh  
I'm attractive  
Ah yeah  
I get everything I want 'cause I attract it  
'Cause I attract it babe  
Mmm mmm  
Oh  
Mmm-oh yeah  
Mmm yeah mmm
