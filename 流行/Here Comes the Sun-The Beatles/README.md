### Here Comes the Sun歌词：

Here comes the sun here comes the sun  
And I say it's all right  
Little darling it's been a long cold lonely winter  
Little darling it feels like years since it's been here  
Here comes the sun here comes the sun  
And I say it's all right  
Little darling the smiles returning to the faces  
Little darling it seems like years since it's been here  
Here comes the sun here comes the sun  
And I say it's all right  
Sun sun sun here it comes  
Sun sun sun here it comes  
Sun sun sun here it comes  
Sun sun sun here it comes  
Sun sun sun here it comes  
Little darling I feel that ice is slowly melting  
Little darling it seems like years since it's been clear  
Here comes the sun here comes the sun  
And I say it's all right  
Here comes the sun here comes the sun  
It's all right  
It's all right
