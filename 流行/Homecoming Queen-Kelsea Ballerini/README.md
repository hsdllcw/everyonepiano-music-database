### Homecoming Queen歌词：

Hey homecoming Queen  
Why do you lie  
When somebody's mean  
Where do you hide  
Do people assume  
You're always alright  
Been so good at smiling  
Most of your life  
Look d**n good in the dress  
Zipping up the mess  
Dancing with your best foot forward  
Does it get hard  
To have to play the part  
Nobody's feeling sorry for ya  
But what if I told you the world wouldn't end  
If you started showing what's under your skin  
What if you let 'em all in on the lie  
Even the homecoming Queen cries  
Hey homecoming Queen  
How's things at home  
Still walking on eggshells  
When that curtains closed  
Did your daddy teach you  
How to act tough  
Or more like your mama  
Sweep it under the rug  
Look d**n good in the dress  
Zipping up the mess  
Dancing with your best foot forward  
Did you want the crown  
Or does it weigh you down  
Nobody's feeling sorry for ya  
What if I told you the world wouldn't end  
If you started showing what's under your skin  
What if you let 'em all in on the lie  
Even the homecoming Queen cries  
Yeah what if I told you the sky wouldn't fall  
If you lost your composure said to hell with it all  
Not everything pretty sparkles and shines  
And even the homecoming Queen cries  
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  
Oh yeah  
Even the homecoming Queen cries  
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  
Hey homecoming Queen  
Why do you lie  
When somebody's mean  
Where do you hide
