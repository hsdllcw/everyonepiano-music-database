### Kill Jill歌词：

[Killer Mike:]  
Polo to the floor tho  
You already know doe  
It's Adamsville forreal  
You see it hoe just take a photo  
I'm reppin' as I'm fo' door as I fo'-fo' on your bro tho  
Cause that do'-do' thought that he could rob a player for some dough tho  
I pff- pff- pff-  
Oh no, on some Allen Temple  
On some England manor, I'm so Mysty' Valley  
And I gotta couple pounds yesterday outta Cali  
And my bad bitch from the valley brought me brand new Bally's  
And I'm playin' with a no, American dream Dusty Rhodes  
Man, she been ridin' clean since her daddy rode on Vogues  
I done fucked her in every hotelly, every hole  
I ain't fucked her with my wife, but if she meet her she might be a go  
Bitch don't I look dashin'  
Bitch don't I look classy  
Bitch don't act so sassy  
I'm the-I'm the man-boo  
That's with or without you  
To hell with what your mouth say, show me what that mouth do  
[Jeezy:]  
I hear 'em talking hella reckless  
I won't even stress  
Just kill 'em softly with my presence  
Won't even address it  
They say it's lonely at the top, but this the best shit ever  
Hey, don't you see me out here shinin'  
Bitch I'm barely flexing  
I hear 'em talking hella reckless  
Y'all won't stress this  
Just kill 'em softly with my presence  
Won't even address it  
They say it's lonely at the top, this the best shit ever  
And even if we die today this shit gon' live forever  
Live forever  
[Big Boi:]  
Daddy Fat Saxxx, with three x's  
Fuck niggas hit the exit  
No S is on my chest but all these diamonds got me blessed  
Usually I don't do this, dumb it down go stupid  
Since 17 been countin' M's my bank account's on goofy  
They say Cosby gave 'em roofies, now who knows what the truth is  
Chicago's full of shooters my garage is full of hoopties  
Got that Southern drawl and all that  
My pretty rose look like ball-bats  
The South got som' to say and all y'all niggas can't get y'all ball back  
If I ain't a hot boy, then what it is, call Sax  
Daddy Fat in it y'all, never fall back  
Like clocks in the wintertime  
We stay eating like it's dinnertime  
Been feasting and chiefing and blowing big but it ain't no reefer round  
We don't know the meaning of drought cause we keep it so wet  
Boi sweat now it's been a while, just speaking in general While there is no
formidable, opponent, or/and nigga that want it  
Pure uncut, never step on it  
Line for line, dope when you want it  
Mine the kind to give a nigga hope when they down and out  
Nigga dig a hole so deep, ain't no climbin' out  
[Jeezy:]  
I hear 'em talking hella reckless  
I won't even stress  
Just kill 'em softly with my presence  
Won't even address it  
They say it's lonely at the top, but this the best shit ever  
Hey, don't you see me out here shinin'  
Bitch I'm barely flexing  
I hear 'em talking hella reckless  
Y'all won't stress this  
Just kill 'em softly with my presence  
Won't even address it  
They say it's lonely at the top, this the best shit ever  
And even if we die today this shit gon' live forever  
Live forever  
Yo hoe, listen  
Just like I turned coco, my vision is pimpin'  
You already know doe  
So go hoe, stroll hoe for the po-po, that's my logo  
Fo' sho hoe, pogo  
Get down on the flo' hoe  
Flo' doe  
Yo hoe, listen  
Just like I turned coco, my vision is pimpin'  
You already know doe  
So go hoe, stroll hoe for the po-po, that's my logo  
Fo' sho' hoe, pogo  
Get down on the flo' hoe  
Flow doe
