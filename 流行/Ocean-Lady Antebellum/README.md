**Ocean双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Ocean_ 是美国乡村音乐演唱组合Lady Antebellum（战前女神）演唱的歌曲。Lady
Antebellum除了拥有丰富的男女和声之外，由于修饰了许多音乐传统的装饰音，也让他们作品的表现力度更直接，更接近Teen-
Pop的范畴，并能因此更容易讨好年轻一代的歌迷。他们的专辑里突出了钢琴明亮的音色，从而让乡村音乐透出一种青春的活力，从而以化繁就简的回归，让人耳目一新。

### Ocean歌词：

How can someone stand so d**n close  
And feel like they're world away  
I can see your sad story eyes  
So how do you have no words to say  
All I want is to fall in deeper  
Than I've ever been  
Why won't you let me  
I can handle your heart so help me  
Here you are next to me  
So much beauty at my feet  
All I wanna do is swim  
But the waves keep crashing in  
No I'm not afraid to drown  
Take me out take me down  
I'm so tired of the shore  
Let me in baby  
You're an ocean beautiful and blue  
I wanna swim in you  
Like a lighthouse I've been shining bright  
Through the dark for the both of us  
And I've done it outta love is not enough  
But God how I wish it was  
And I don't wanna find out  
How much lonely I can take before you lose me  
Baby look at me and swear you won't lose me  
Here you are next to me  
So much beauty at my feet  
All I wanna do is swim  
But the waves keep crashing in  
No I'm not afraid to drown  
Take me out take me down  
I'm so tired of the shore  
Let me in baby  
You're an ocean beautiful and blue  
I wanna swim in you  
I can't let it go  
From your arms  
But they come back again  
The waves the waves the waves the waves  
The waves the waves the waves the waves  
Here you are next to me  
So much beauty at my feet  
All I wanna do is swim  
But the waves keep crashing in  
No I'm not afraid to drown  
Take me out take me down  
I'm so tired of the shore  
Let me in baby  
You're an ocean beautiful and blue  
I wanna swim in you
