### Small Town Throwdown歌词：

(Brantley)Aw Son  
Round these parts there aint much to do  
except work like a dog til Friday  
Punch that clock  
cash that check raise a little hell til Sunday

(Thomas)Theres a party back in the woods tonight  
Heard it thru the redneck grapevine  
Gotta keg of beer and a buncha girls  
Sure enough gunna be a goodtime  
Chorus(Brantley And Thomas)It's a small town throwdown  
Its time to tall boy up let them tailgates down  
Yea Man its on tonight right into morning light  
Crank that country up loud  
It's a small town throwdown

(Justin)Ow we bout to throw it down son  
Now We gota field ful of daisy dukes  
Round here we know how to grow em  
Rockin little body and long tan legs sure aint scared to show em nawh  
(Brantley)Show a little son girl  
Somebody said them city boys

If they bring it cross that county line
