《 **Your Song** 》是Elton John（艾尔顿•约翰）演唱的歌曲。简单的钢琴与弦乐伴奏，再伴上甜蜜的歌词，《Your
Song》可以说是Elton John最脍炙人口的情歌之一。

歌曲结尾处的那句歌词：“How wonderful life is while you are in the
world（有你的世界多么美好）”简直可以直接当情诗句子用了。平滑流畅的钢琴和Elton
John淡淡柔情的演唱，似乎就是和爱人相拥坐在黄昏中的木屋顶，看远处夕阳西下，与世上最最甜美的双眸对望，任似水年华静静流淌。这时不用很多钱，不用大房子，只要有一首由爱人所唱，但却只属于自己的歌就足够了。

### Your Song歌词：

It's a little bit funny this feeling inside  
I'm not one of those who can easily hide  
I don't have much money but boy if I did  
I'd buy a big house where we both could live  
If I was a sculptor but then again no  
Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show  
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do  
My gift is my song and this one's for you  
And you can tell everybody this is your song  
It may be quite simple but now that it's done  
I hope you don't mind  
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words  
How wonderful life is while you're in the world  
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss  
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross  
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song  
It's for people like you that keep it turned on  
So excuse me forgetting but these things I do  
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue  
Anyway the thing is what I really mean  
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen  
And you can tell everybody this is your song  
It may be quite simple but now that it's done  
I hope you don't mind  
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words  
How wonderful life is while you're in the world  
I hope you don't mind  
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words  
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
