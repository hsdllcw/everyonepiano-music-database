### That's What Love Is歌词：

Ooh and I can feel you  
Even though I haven't touched you  
Yeah that's what love is  
That's what true love is  
Wouldn't want nobody else by my side  
Ooh and you can trust me  
After all the lies I told you  
Yeah that's what love is  
That's what true love is  
Don't nobody else deserve my time  
I reach out to you but my hands can't hold enough  
Enough of your greatness  
You teach me patience  
Like the best of our worlds collide  
Never understood what it meant  
It meant to submit to love  
So beyond what lust is hey  
It's a blessing that you're in my life  
Make me look even better  
When we shine we shine together  
Yeah that's what love is  
Now that's what love is  
Don't nobody else deserve my eyes  
When you demand my presence  
It's hard to read the message  
I stay on the defense  
To take away your leverage  
'Til you put it in perspective  
Can't help to respect it  
Oh no I know what love is  
I know what true love is  
Yeah down in my soul far more than you know  
My self esteem gets too low  
You lift it right up through the ceiling  
Ooh woah  
Ooh and I can feel you  
Even though I haven't touched you  
Yeah that's what love is  
Now that's what love is  
Wouldn't want nobody else by my side  
No ahh ah ahh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
That's what love is  
That's what love is  
La la la la la la  
I appreciate you  
Ahh ahh ahh  
God bless your maker hey  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
That's what love is  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
That's what love is  
La la la la la la  
Look at this love
