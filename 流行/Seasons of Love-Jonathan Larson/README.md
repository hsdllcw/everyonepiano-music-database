### Seasons of Love歌词：

Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes  
Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred moments so dear  
Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes  
How do you measure -- measure a year?  
In daylights -- In sunsets  
In midnights -- In cups of coffee  
In inches -- In miles  
In laughter -- In strife  
In -- Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes  
How do you measure a year in the life?  
How about love?  
How about love?  
How about love?  
Measure in love  
Seasons of love  
Seasons of love  
Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes  
Five hundred twenty-five thousand  
Journeys to plan  
Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes  
How do you measure the life  
Of a woman or a man?  
In truths that she learned  
Or in times that he cried  
In bridges he burned  
Or the way that she died  
ALL  
It's time now - to sing out  
Tho' the story never ends  
Let's celebrate  
Remember a year in the life of friends  
Remember the love  
Remember the love  
Remember the love  
Measure in love  
Measure, measure your life in love  
Seasons of love ...  
Seasons of love...  
In daylights -- In sunsets  
In midnights -- In cups of coffee  
In inches -- In miles  
In laughter -- In strife  
In -- Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes  
How do you measure a year in the life?  
Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes  
How do you measure a year in the life?  
Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes  
How do you measure a year in the life?  
Remember the love  
Remember the love  
Remember the love  
Seasons of love..
