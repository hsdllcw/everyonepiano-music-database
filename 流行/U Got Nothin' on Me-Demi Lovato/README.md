### U Got Nothin' on Me歌词：

U got nothin' on me  
U got nothin' on me  
U got nothin' on me

Summer came you took me by surprise  
The California sunshine in my eyes  
Driving with the top down we sang along  
To our favorite songs, nothing could go wrong

[Verse 2:]  
Laughing as we gazed under the moon  
You kissed me and it never felt too soon  
Hard to believe that anything could tear us apart  
That you'd break my heart

[Chorus:]  
Now I know who you are  
U got nothing on me, I see  
I should've known it from the start  
(U got nothing on me)  
You can't tell me lies  
Don't even try 'cause  
This is goodbye, goodbye

[Verse 3:]  
Caught you from the corner of my eye  
You smiled at a girl while passing by  
Thought you had me fooled but you were wrong  
I know what's going on, it didn't take me long

[Verse 4:]  
It wasn't hard to read between the lines  
The necklace in your car that wasn't mine  
Nothing left for you to do or say, so I'm on my way  
Now it's too late

[Chorus:]  
Now I know who you are  
U got nothing on me, I see  
I should've known it from the start  
(U got nothing on me)  
You can't tell me lies  
Don't even try 'cause  
This is...

Goodbye to broken promises  
Time to face your carelessness  
Don't bore me with apologies  
Or come back crawling on  
your knees

U got nothin' on me, U got nothin' on me  
I know who you are  
Yeah, I see I should've known it from the start  
You can't tell me lies  
Don't even try 'cause,  
This is goodbye

[Chorus:]  
Now I know who you are  
U got nothing on me, I see  
I should've known it from the start  
(U got nothing on me)  
You can't tell me lies  
Don't even try 'cause  
This is goodbye, goodbye
