### Story of My Life歌词：

Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain  
I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days  
She told me in the morning she don't feel the same about us in her bones  
It seems to me that when I die these words will be written on my stone  
And I'll be gone gone tonight  
The ground beneath my feet is open wide  
The way that I been holdin' on too tight  
With nothing in between  
The story of my life I take her home  
I drive all night to keep her warm and time  
Is frozen (the story of, the story of)  
The story of my life I give her hope  
I spend her love until she's broke inside  
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)  
Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change  
Leave my heart open but it stays right here in its cage  
I know that in the morning  
I'll see us in the light upon your ear  
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still  
And I'll be gone gone tonight  
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright  
The way that I been holdin' on so tight  
With nothing in between  
The story of my life I take her home  
I drive all night to keep her warm and time  
Is frozen (the story of, the story of)  
The story of my life I give her hope  
I spend her love until she's broke inside  
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)  
And I been waiting for this time to come around  
But baby running after you is like chasing the clouds  
The story of my life I take her home  
I drive all night to keep her warm and time  
Is frozen  
The story of my life I give her hope (give her hope)  
I spend her love until she's broke inside (until she's broke inside)  
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)  
The story of my life  
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)  
The story of my life
