**LA Devotee双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_LA Devotee_ 是美国摇滚乐队Panic! at the Disco的歌曲，收录在其专辑Death of a Bachelor中。Panic!
At The Disco这名字看来有点古怪。根据他们的解释，"Panic"一字是引自加洲奥兰治县(The O.C.!!)乐队Name
Taken中的一句歌词，以及The Smiths的同名歌曲而作成的。虽然他们没有对At The
Disco作任何注解，但是凭着这个字根，你也可以想象他们的音乐类型了。

### LA Devotee歌词：

You got two black eyes from loving too hard  
And a black car that matches your blackest soul  
I wouldn't change ya, oh oh  
Wouldn't ever try to make you leave, no  
The neon coast was your sign  
And the Midwest wind with Pisces rising  
Wouldn't change ya, oh oh  
Wouldn't ever try to make you leave, no

Static palms melt your vibe  
Midnight whisperings

The black magic of Mulholland Drive  
Swimming pools under desert skies  
Drinking white wine in the blushing light  
Just another LA Devotee  
Sunsets on the evil eye  
Invisible to the Hollywood shrine  
Always on the hunt for a little more time  
Just another LA Devotee  
Just another, just another, uh oh  
Just another, just another, uh oh  
Just another, just another, uh oh  
Just another LA Devotee

You got bleached out eyes from the valley sand  
And the black tar palms keep weeping your name  
I couldn't change ya, oh oh  
Couldn't ever try to make you see, no  
The high rise lights read your rights  
And a downtown storm with Aries rising  
Couldn't change ya, oh oh  
Couldn't ever try to make you see, no

Static palms melt your vibe  
Midnight whisperings

The black magic of Mulholland Drive  
Swimming pools under desert skies  
Drinking white wine in the blushing light  
Just another LA Devotee  
Sunsets on the evil eye  
Invisible to the Hollywood shrine  
Always on the hunt for a little more time  
Just another LA Devotee  
Just another, just another, uh oh  
Just another, just another, uh oh  
Just another, just another, uh oh  
Just another LA Devotee

LA Devotee  
LA Devotee  
LA Devotee  
LA Devotee

The black magic of Mulholland Drive  
Swimming pools under desert skies  
Drinking white wine in the blushing light  
Just another LA Devotee  
Sunsets on the evil eye  
Invisible to the Hollywood shrine  
Always on the hunt for a little more time  
Just another LA Devotee  
Just another, just another, uh oh  
Just another, just another, uh oh  
Just another, just another, uh oh  
Just another LA Devotee
