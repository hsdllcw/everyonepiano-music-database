### Dust歌词：

She's sick of this town, she's sick of that boy  
Yeah she's sick of dreams that never take flight  
There's gotta be more than the same old story  
So she's gonna turn the page tonight  
And turn the radio up (turn the radio up)  
Roll the windows down  
She got a full tank of gas (she got a full tank of gas)  
Ain't no stopping her now

She's got the pedal to the floor in a hand-me-down Ford,  
Yeah, the only thing that's left to do  
Is catch a couple green lights and those baby blue eyes  
Are leaving nothing in that rearview  
But dust, nothing but dust

She's fighting back tears, she's fighting back years  
Of the only life she's ever known  
There's a future that's bright in the dead of this night,  
And all she's gotta do is go  
And turn the radio up (turn the radio up)  
Roll the windows down  
She got an open road (she got an open road)  
Ain't no stopping her now

She's got the pedal to the floor in a hand-me-down Ford,  
Yeah, the only thing that's left to do  
Is catch a couple green lights and those baby blue eyes  
Are leaving nothing in that rearview  
But dust, nothing but dust  
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)

She got the radio up,  
She got the windows down,  
No she won't look back  
Ain't no stopping her,  
Ain't no stopping her now…

She's got the pedal to the floor in a hand-me-down Ford,  
Yeah, the only thing that's left to do  
Is catch a couple green lights and those baby blue eyes  
Are leaving nothing in that rearview  
But dust, nothing but dust  
Dust, nothing but dust  
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)  
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
