### Woman歌词：

Let's be serious it's a real  
This is excuse me  
OK shut up  
I buy my own things I pay my own bills  
These diamond rings my automobiles  
Everything I got I bought it  
Boys can't buy my love buy my love yeah  
I do what I want he does  
Say what you say  
I work real hard every day  
I'm a motherf**king woman baby alright  
I don't need a man to be holding me too tight  
I'm a motherf**king woman baby that's right  
I'm just having fun with my ladies here tonight  
I'm a motherf**ker  
Mmm yeah  
Driving around town in my cadillac  
Girls in the front boys in the back  
Loosey as a goosey and we're looking for some fun  
I'm a motherf**king woman baby alright  
I don't need a man to be holding me too tight  
I'm a motherf**king woman baby that's right  
I'm just having fun with my ladies here tonight  
I'm a motherf**ker
