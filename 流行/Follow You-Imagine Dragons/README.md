**Follow You** 是美国Imagine Dragons乐队的新单。

乐队主唱Dan Reynolds述说新歌《 _Follow You_ 》背后的故事，2018年Dan在社交媒体上宣布过他和他的妻子Aja
Volkman决定离婚。在他去找律师签署离婚协议时，收到一条妻子的短信，改变了他的想法，然后写下了这首歌。

Imagine
Dragons的歌曲从不企图惊艳全场，只是沉稳地缓慢推进，近乎平庸的声线展示着朴素的美妙。保持平庸是另一种自信，深知静水流深的道理。跟声音一样，Imagine
Dragons的创作同样追逐平凡美感，他们的歌曲中，不插科打诨不肆意秀文采，平铺直叙日常事，浪漫时作一首小诗。

### Follow You歌词：

You know I got your number number all night  
I'm always on your team I got your back alright  
Taking those taking those losses if it treats you right  
I want to put you into the spotlight  
If the world would only know what you've been holding back  
Heart attacks every night  
Oh you know it's not right  
I'll follow you way down wherever you may go  
I'll follow you way down to your deepest low  
I'll always be around wherever life takes you  
You know I'll follow you  
Call you up you've been cryin' cryin' all night  
You're only disappointed in yourself alright  
Taking those taking those losses if it treats you right  
I wanna take you into the sunlight  
If the world would only know what you've been holding back  
Heart attacks every night  
Oh you know it's not right  
I'll follow you way down wherever you may go  
I'll follow you way down to your deepest low  
I'll always be around wherever life takes you  
You know I'll follow you  
You know I'll follow you  
Wherever life takes you you know I'll follow you  
She's not the type to give herself enough love  
She live her life hand in a tight glove  
I wish that I could fix it I could fix it for you  
But instead I'll be right here comin' through  
Right here comin' through  
I'll follow you way down wherever you may go  
I'll follow you way down to your deepest low  
I'll always be around wherever life takes you  
You know I'll follow you  
You know I'll follow you  
Wherever life takes you you know I'll follow you
