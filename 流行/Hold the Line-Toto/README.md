### Hold the Line歌词：

It's not in the way that you hold me  
It's not in the way you say you care  
It's not in the way you've been treating my friends  
It's not in the way that you stayed till the end  
It's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you'll do  
Hold the line love isn't always on time oh oh oh  
Hold the line love isn't always on time oh oh oh  
It's not in the words that you told me girl  
It's not in the way you say you're mine ooh  
It's not in the way that you came back to me  
It's not in the way that your love set me free  
It's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you'll do  
Hold the line love isn't always on time  
Hold the line love isn't always on time  
It's not in the words that you told me girl  
It's not in the way you say you're mine ooh  
It's not in the way that you came back to me  
It's not in the way that your love set me free  
It's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you'll do  
Hold the line love isn't always on time  
Hold the line love isn't always on time  
Hold the line love isn't always on time  
Hold the line love isn't always on time  
Hold the line love isn't always on time  
Love isn't always on time
