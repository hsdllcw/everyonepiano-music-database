### Love歌词：

Kendrick lamar：  
Damn love or lust  
Damn all of us  
Both：  
Give me a run for my money  
There is nobody no one to outrun me  
Another world premiere  
So give me a run for my money  
Sippin' bubbly feelin' lovely livin' lovely  
Just love me  
I wanna be with you ay I wanna be with  
I wanna be with you ay I wanna be with  
I wanna be with you  
Love me just love me  
If I didn't ride blade on curb would you still love me  
If I minimized my net worth would you still love me  
Keep it a hundred I'd rather you trust me than to love me  
Keep it a whole one hund' don't got you I got nothin'  
Kendrick Lamar：  
Ay I got somethin'  
Hold up we gon' function no assumptions  
Feelin' like tyson with it  
Knock it out twice I'm with it  
Only for the night I'm kiddin'  
Only for life you're a homie for life  
You're a homie for life let's get it  
Hit that shoulder lean  
I know what comin' over mean  
Backstroke oversea  
I know what you need  
Already on ten our money come in  
All feeling go out this feeling don't drought  
This party won't end  
Both：  
If I didn't ride blade on curb would you still love me  
If I minimized my net worth would you still love me  
Keep it a hundred I'd rather you trust me than to love me  
Keep it a whole one hund' don't got you I got nothin'  
Give me a run for my money  
There is nobody no one to outrun me  
So give me a run for my money  
Sippin' bubbly feelin' lovely livin' lovely  
Just love me  
I wanna be with you ay I wanna be with  
I wanna be with you ay I wanna be with  
I wanna be with you  
Kendrick Lamar：  
I'm on the way  
We ain't got no time to waste  
Poppin' your gum on the way  
Am I in the way  
I don't wan' pressure you none  
I want your blessing today  
Oh by the way open the door by the way  
Told you that I'm on the way  
I'm on the way I know connection is vague  
Pick up the phone for me babe  
Damn it we jammin'  
Bad attitude from your nanny  
Curves and your hips from your mammy  
Remember gardena I took the studio camera  
I know top will be mad at me  
I had to do it I want your body your music  
I bought the big one to prove it  
Look what you made  
Told you that I'm on the way  
I'm like an exit away yep  
Both：  
If I didn't ride blade on curb would you still love me  
If I minimized my net worth would you still love me  
Keep it a hundred I'd rather you trust me than to love me  
Keep it a whole one hund' don't got you I got nothin'  
Give me a run for my money  
There is nobody no one to outrun me  
So give me a run for my money  
Sippin' bubbly feelin' lovely livin' lovely  
Just love me  
I wanna be with you ay I wanna be with  
I wanna be with you ay I wanna be with  
I wanna be with you  
Love me just love me
