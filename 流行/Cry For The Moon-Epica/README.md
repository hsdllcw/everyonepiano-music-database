**Cry For The Moon双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Cry For The Moon_
是来自荷兰的交响金属乐队Epica的歌曲。乐队创立于2003年。这是一个交响力量团，一般力量乐队的都带史诗的感觉，尤其是交响力量，他们引用了拉丁语epica（即：史诗）做为乐队的名字。Cry
for the Moon 是他们的第一张单曲，发行于2003年。

Epica的音乐是盛气凌人的、极端的。从字面意义上看：Epica是宏伟壮丽的，和其他一些被屈服的、自省的
表现精神。乐队还有一些前卫的倾向，同时哥特的大气和多愁善感也表现在音乐中。

### Cry For The Moon歌词：

Follow your common sense  
You cannot hide yourself  
Behind a fairytale forever and ever  
Only by revealing the whole truth can we disclose  
The soul of this bulwark forever and ever  
Forever and ever  
Indoctrinated minds so very often  
Contain sick thoughts  
And commit most of the evil they preach against  
Don't try to convince me with messages from God  
You accuse us of sins committed by yourselves  
It's easy to condemn without looking in the mirror  
Behind the scenes opens reality  
Eternal silence cries out for justice  
Forgiveness is not for sale  
Nor is the will to forget  
Follow your common sense  
You cannot hide yourself  
Behind a fairytale forever and ever  
Only by revealing the whole truth can we disclose  
The soul of this bulwark forever and ever  
Forever and ever  
Virginity has been stolen at very young ages  
And the extinguisher loses it's immunity  
Morbid abuse of power in the Garden of Eden  
Where the apple gets a youthful face, a youthful face  
Eternal silence cries out for justice  
Forgiveness is not for sale  
Nor is the will to forget  
Follow your common sense  
You cannot hide yourself  
Behind a fairytale forever and ever  
Only by revealing the whole truth can we disclose  
The soul of this bulwark forever and ever  
Forever and ever  
Eternal silence cries out for justice  
Forgiveness is not for sale  
Nor is the will to forget  
You can't go on hiding yourself  
(Follow your common sense, you cannot hide yourself)  
Behind old fashioned fairy tales  
(Follow your common sense, you cannot hide yourself)  
And keep washing your hands in innocence
