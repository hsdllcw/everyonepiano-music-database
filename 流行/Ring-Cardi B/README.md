Cardi B：  
Should I call first I can't decide  
I want to but a b**ch got pride  
The switchin' up sh*t is what I can't f**k with  
I'm feelin' you but you hard to get in touch with  
And you ain't hit me up in a while  
Actin' like you don't know what number to dial  
You quit then that's it I'ma throw in the towel  
'Cause a n**ga only goin' through what you allow  
You don't want this gun smoke  
Learn to text with your nose if your thumb broke  
I don't care if we gettin' to it and I stall on your a**  
But I still wake up from missed calls from your a** n**ga  
Kehlani：  
You don't hit my line no more oh oh

Cardi B：  
Nah n**ga now you gon' have to call me call me  
'Cause I'm lookin' at these messages they on me yeah  
Actin' like they ain't n**gas that want me  
Let another n**ga in your spot and you gon' be hot n**ga coffee  
You gon' be sick to your stomach  
Hit me when you free 1-800
