Rehab歌词：

  

They tried to make me go to rehab but I said, 'No, no, no.'  
Yes, I've been black but when I come back you'll know, know, know  
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine  
He's tried to make me go to rehab but I won't go, go, go

I'd rather be at home with ray  
I ain't got seventy days  
'Cause there's nothing  
There's nothing you can teach me  
That I can't learn from Mr Hathaway

I didn't get a lot in class  
But I know it don't come in a shot glass

They tried to make me go to rehab but I said, 'No, no, no.'  
Yes, I've been black but when I come back you'll know, know, know  
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine  
He's tried to make me go to rehab but I won't go, go, go

The man said, 'Why do you think you're here?'  
I said, 'I got no idea  
I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby  
So I always keep a bottle near.'  
He said, 'I just think you're depressed,  
Kiss me, yeah baby, and go rest.'

They tried to make me go to rehab but I said, 'No, no, no.'  
Yes, I've been black but when I come back you'll know, know, know

I don't ever wanna drink again  
I just, ooh, I just need a friend  
I'm not gonna spend ten weeks  
Have everyone think I'm on the mend

It's not just my pride  
It's just 'til these tears have dried

They tried to make me go to rehab but I said, 'No, no, no.'  
Yes, I've been black but when I come back you'll know, know, know  
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine  
He's tried to make me go to rehab but I won't go, go, go
