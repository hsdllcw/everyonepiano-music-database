Life of the Party歌词：

I love it when you just don't care  
I love it when you dance like there's nobody there  
So when it gets hard, don't be afraid  
We don't care what them people say  
I love it when you don't take no  
I love it when you do what you want cause you just said so  
Let them all go home, we out late  
We don't care what them people say

We don't have to be ordinary  
Make your best mistakes  
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry  
So baby be the life of the party  
I'm telling you to take your shot it might be scary  
Hearts are gonna break  
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry  
So baby be the life of the party

Together we can just let go  
Pretend like there's no one else here that we know  
Slow dance fall in love as the club track plays  
We don't care what them people say

We don't have to be ordinary  
Make your best mistakes  
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry  
So baby be the life of the party  
I'm telling you to take your shot it might be scary  
Hearts are gonna break  
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry  
So baby be the life of the party

Come out tonight, come out tonight  
There's no one standing in your way  
Come out tonight, come out tonight  
We don't care what them people say  
We don't care what them people say

We don't have to be ordinary  
Make your best mistakes  
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry  
So baby be the life of the party  
I'm telling you to take your shot it might be scary  
Hearts are gonna break  
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry  
So baby be the life of the party

Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Life of the party  
So don't let them keep you down  
Oh you know you can't give up  
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry  
So baby be the life of the party
