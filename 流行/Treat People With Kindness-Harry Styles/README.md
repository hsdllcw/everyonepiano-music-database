### Treat People With Kindness歌词：

Maybe we can  
Find a place to feel good  
And we can treat people with kindness  
Find a place to feel good  
I've got a good feeling  
I'm just takin' it all in  
Floating up and dreamin'  
Droppin' into the deep end  
And if we're here long enough  
They'll sing a song for us  
Ah-ah-ah-ah  
And we'll belong  
Maybe we can  
Find a place to feel good  
And we can treat people with kindness  
Find a place to feel good  
Giving second chances  
I don't need all the answers  
Feeling good in my skin  
I just keep on dancin'  
And if we're here long enough  
We'll see it's all for us  
And we'll belong  
Maybe we can  
Find a place to feel good  
And we can treat people with kindness  
Find a place to feel good  
And it's just another day  
And it's just another day  
If our friends all pass away  
Oh-oh oh-oh  
It's okay  
It's okay it's okay  
It's okay  
It's okay  
It's okay  
Yeah  
Hey  
Here we go now  
Maybe we can  
Find a place to feel good  
And we can treat people with kindness  
Find a place to feel good  
All we ever want is automatic all the time  
All we ever want is automatic all the time  
All we ever want is automatic all the time  
All we ever want is automatic all the time  
All together now  
Maybe we can  
One more time  
Find a place to feel good  
And we can treat people with kindness  
Just a little more kindness  
Find a place to feel good
