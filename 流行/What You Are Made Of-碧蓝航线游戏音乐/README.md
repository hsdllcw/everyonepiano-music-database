### What You're Made Of歌词：

Lights go down inside your head again  
The walls are thin  
Like they're closin' in  
Lost yourself inside a broken mirror  
'Cause that's what you fear  
But I'm still here  
Push me out and I pull you closer  
When you think that it's all over  
Know that you will never be unloved by me  
Oh, you're bigger than this moment  
Might be bad but you're not broken  
Know that you will never be unloved by me  
'Cause I know what you're made of  
I know what you're made of  
Burned out with the fire in your eyes  
But you're gonna rise  
'Cause you know how to fight  
And you might fall down further than before  
But it takes hittin' the floor  
To know you're worth much more  
Push me out and I pull you closer  
When you think that it's all over  
Know that you will never be unloved by me  
Oh, you're bigger than this moment  
Might be bad but you're not broken  
Know that you will never be unloved by me  
'Cause I know what you're made of  
I know what you're made of  
I know what you're made of  
I know what you're made of  
Said, I know what you're made of  
(You will never be unloved by me)  
I know what you're made of  
I know what you're made of  
I know what you're made of  
Push me out and I pull you closer  
When you think that it's all over  
Know that you will never be unloved by me  
Push me out and I pull you closer  
When you think that it's all over  
Know that you will never be unloved by me  
Oh, you're bigger than this moment  
Might be bad but you're not broken  
Know that you will never be unloved by me  
I know what you're made of  
I know what you're made of  
I know what you're made of  
I know what you're made of  
I know what you're made of  
I know what you're made of
