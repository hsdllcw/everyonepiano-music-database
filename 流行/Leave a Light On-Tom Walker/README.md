《 **Leave a Light On** 》是英国创作歌手Tom
Walker的歌曲，发行于2017年10月13日。发行之初就登上了Spotify周五新歌推荐榜单，也让Walker这一崭新的面孔登上了德国周五新音乐的封面。

而Tom Walker的嗓音似乎也很适合治愈，融合了多种风格的他，铸成的却是音乐上的质朴与纯净，有些淡淡的情绪化，配合电子和鼓点，副歌部分让人欲罢不能。

《 _Leave a Light On_ 》源自于Tom Walker的朋友与毒瘾的斗争的真实经历
，整首歌贯穿着他对朋友的支持与鼓励，词如其人，不够华丽，却又字字笃定真诚。令人在感到无助的时候，仍能拥有温柔的力量在背后支撑，助你战胜黑暗，迎接光明。

### Leave a Light On歌词：

The second someone mentioned you were all alone  
I could feel the trouble coursing through your veins  
Now I know it's got a hold  
Just a phone called left unanswered had me sparking up  
These cigarettes won't stop me wondering where you are  
Don't let go keep a hold  
If you look into the distance there's a house upon the hill  
Guiding like a lighthouse to a place where you'll be  
Safe to feel at grace 'cause we've all made mistakes  
If you've lost your way  
I will leave the light on  
I will leave the light on  
I will leave the light on  
I will leave the light on  
Tell me what's been happening what's been on your mind  
Lately you've been searching for a darker place  
To hide that's alright  
But if you carry on abusing you'll be robbed from us  
I refuse to lose another friend to drugs  
Just come home don't let go  
If you look into the distance there's a house upon the hill  
Guiding like a lighthouse to a place where you'll be  
Safe to feel at grace 'cause we've all made mistakes  
If you've lost your way  
I will leave the light on  
I will leave the light on  
I will leave the light on  
I will leave the light on  
I will leave the light on  
If you look into the distance there's a house upon the hill  
Guiding like a lighthouse it's a place where you'll be  
Safe to feel at grace and if you've lost your way  
If you've lost your way I will leave the light on  
And I know you don't know oh but I need you to be brave  
Hiding from the truth ain't gonna make this all okay  
I'll see your pain if you don't feel our grace  
And you've lost your way  
I will leave the light on  
I will leave the light on  
'Cause I will leave the light on
