**Sorry** 是Justin Bieber的一首单曲，收录于新专辑Purpose
(Deluxe)中。《Purpose》全专歌曲由电音人气王Skrillex、Diplo及嘻哈乐坛王牌制作Rick Rubin操刀制作。

动感电音、性感R&B以及钢琴伴奏慢情歌，动用一百种方式展示专业。展示出的超强可塑性近乎于炫技，这证明，虽然近几年专注于消耗偶像资本，但这位大众偶像的业务能力并未疏于修炼。更难得的是，此番炫技并非过于在架势上虚张声势，这是货真价实的实力展示。相比年少时幼稚质感，如今成年后果真修养出沉稳有厚度。内容方面，更加符合严肃语境，再也不见小孩子憧憬爱情的天真，他摆正腔调要和这个世界谈谈。《
_Sorry_
》更是主动致歉。之前从多次在公众场合口头表达歉意时就足够获取群众认可，新专辑专门创作歌曲再次悔恨，浪子的态度相当感人。熊孩子终于醒悟，不再沉迷玩闹的世界，转而思考人生。

### Sorry歌词：

You gotta go and get  
Angry at all of my honesty  
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies  
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call the referee?  
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness

I know you know that I  
Made those mistakes maybe once or twice  
And by once or twice I Mean  
Maybe a couple a hundred times  
So let me oh let me  
Redeem oh redeem oh myself tonight  
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

Yeah  
Is it too late now to say sorry?  
Cause I'm missing more than just your body  
Is it too late now to say sorry?  
Yeah I know that I let you down  
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?  
I'm sorry yeah  
Sorry yeah  
Sorry  
Yeah I know that I let you down  
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'll take every single piece of the blame  
If you want me too  
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two  
I'll go I'll go and then  
You go you go out and spill the truth  
Can we both say the words, say forget this?

Yeah  
Is it too late now to say sorry?  
Cause I'm missing more than just your body  
Is it too late now to say sorry?  
Yeah I know that I let you down  
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm not just trying to get you back on me  
Cause I'm missing more than just your body  
Is it too late now to say sorry?  
Yeah I know that I let you down  
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm sorry (yeah)  
Sorry (oh)  
Sorry  
Yeah I know that I let you down  
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm sorry (yeah)  
Sorry (oh)  
Sorry  
Yeah I know that I let you down  
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
