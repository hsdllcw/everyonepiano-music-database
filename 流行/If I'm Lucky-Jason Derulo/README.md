### If I'm Lucky歌词：

Who are you to say that I didn't love you  
'Cause I didn't love the way you wanted  
And who am I to blame  
When I didn't trust you enough to let you in the way  
I wanted  
Stop okay  
Vodka on my lips  
Took too many drinks  
Makes me reminisce all the way down  
To my happy place you're my happy place  
I can't handle us now  
If I'm lucky I'll meet ya flip side of the graveyard  
'Cause things didn't work out in this life but someday  
If I'm lucky I'll met ya head in the high water  
'Cause things didn't work out in this life but maybe  
If I'm lucky eh  
If I'm lucky eh  
Get your loving  
'Cause things didn't work out in this life but someday  
Who am I to say that it wasn't good baby  
Just thinkin' about our loving give me chills up  
And down my spine  
I dare you not to miss me  
'Cause what we had was more than just a thrill  
Stop okay  
Vodka on my lips  
Took too many drinks  
Makes me reminisce all the way down  
To my happy place you're my happy place  
I can't handle us now  
If I'm lucky I'll meet ya flip side of the graveyard  
'Cause things didn't work out in this life but someday  
If I'm lucky I'll met ya head in the high water  
'Cause things didn't work out in this life but maybe  
If I'm lucky  
If I'm lucky if I'm lucky  
Get your love in sweet safe 'cause I really miss it babe  
'Cause things didn't work out in this life but someday  
I'm selfish for you  
I'm selfish for you  
If I'm lucky I'll meet ya  
If I'm lucky I'll meet ya on the flip side of the graveyard  
'Cause things didn't work out in this life but someday  
If I'm lucky I'll met ya head in the high water  
'Cause things didn't work out in this life but maybe  
If I'm lucky if I'm lucky baby  
If I'm lucky if I'm lucky baby  
I'll get your love in  
'Cause things didn't work out in this life but someday  
I'm selfish for you  
I'm selfish for you  
And only you baby
