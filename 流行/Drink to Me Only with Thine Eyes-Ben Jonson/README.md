### Drink to Me Only with Thine Eyes歌词：

Drink to me only with thine eyes  
And I will pledge with mine  
Or leave a kiss but in the cup  
And I'll not look for wine  
The thirst that from the soul doth rise  
Doth ask a drink divine  
But might I of Jove's nectar sup  
I would not change for thine  
I sent thee late a rosy wreath  
Not so much honouring thee  
As giving it a hope that there  
It could not withered be  
But thou thereon didst only breathe  
And sent'st it back to me  
Since when it grows and smells I swear  
Not of itself but thee
