### Almost is Never Enough歌词：

Verse 1: (Ariana Grande)  
I'd like to say we gave it a try  
I'd like to blame it all on life  
Maybe we just weren't right,  
That's a lie  
That's a lie

Bridge:  
And we can deny it as much as we want,  
But in time our feelings will show,  
Cause sooner or later  
We'll wonder why we gave up  
But truth is,everyone knows

Chorus:  
Oh, almost, almost is never enough  
So close to being in love,  
If I would have known that you wanted me,  
The way I wanted you  
Maybe we wouldn't be two world apart,  
But right here in each others arms  
Well we almost, we almost knew what love was,  
But almost is never enough

Verse 2: (Nathan Sykes)  
If I could change the world overnight,  
There'd be no such thing as goodbye  
You'll be standing right where you were  
And we'd get the chance we deserve

Bridge:  
Try to deny it as much as you want  
But in time our feelings will show  
Cause sooner or later,  
We'll wonder why we gave up  
The truth is everyone knows

Chorus:  
Almost, almost is never enough,  
So close to being in love,  
If I would have known that you wanted me,  
The way I wanted you,  
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart  
But right here in each others arms  
Well we almost, we almost knew what love was,  
But almost is never enough

Oh, oh baby, you know, you know baby  
Almost, is never enough baby  
You know  
（圣杯神器：骸骨之城 电影原声版到此处歌曲结束）  
Bridge:  
And we can deny it as much as we want  
But in time our feelings will show  
Cause sooner or later,  
We'll wonder why we gave up,  
Truth is, everyone knows

Chorus:  
Almost, almost is never enough (it's never enough baby)  
(We were so close) So close to being in love (sooo close)  
If I would have know that you wanted me (that wanted me)  
The way I wanted you,  
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart,  
But right here in each others arms (in each others arms)  
Well we almost, we almost knew what love was,  
But almost is never enough

Oh, oh baby, you know, you know baby  
Almost, is never enough baby  
You know
