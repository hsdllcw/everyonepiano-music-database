### Heroes歌词：

Don't tell the gods I left a mess  
I can't undo what has been done  
Let's run for cover  
What if I'm the only hero left  
You better fire off your gun  
Once and forever  
He said go dry your eyes  
And live your life like there is no tomorrow, son  
And tell the others  
To go sing it like a hummingbird  
The greatest anthem ever heard:

We are the heroes of our time  
But we're dancing with the demons in our minds...  
We are the heroes of our time  
Hero-uh-o-o-oes  
O-uh-o-o-oh  
We're dancing with the demons in our minds  
Hero-uh-o-o-oes O-uh-o-o-oh

The crickets sing a song for you  
Don't say a word, don't make a sound  
It's life's creation  
I make worms turn into butterflies  
Wake up and turn this world around  
In appreciation  
He said I never left your side  
When you were lost I followed right behind  
Was your foundation  
Now go sing it like a hummingbird  
The greatest anthem ever heard:

We are the heroes of our time  
Hero-uh-o-o-oes  
O-uh-o-o-oh  
We're dancing with the demons in our minds  
Hero-uh-o-o-oes O-uh-o-o-oh

(We keep dancing with the demons  
You could be a hero)

Go sing it like a hummingbird  
The greatest anthem ever heard  
Now sing together...

We are the heroes of our time  
Hero-uh-o-o-oes  
O-uh-o-o-oh  
But we're dancing with the demons in our minds  
Hero-uh-o-o-oes O-uh-o-o-oh  
We are the heroes of our time  
Hero-uh-o-o-oes  
O-uh-o-o-oh  
But we're dancing with the demons in our minds  
Hero-uh-o-o-oes O-uh-o-o-oh

We are the heroes
