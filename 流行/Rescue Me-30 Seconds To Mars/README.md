### Rescue Me歌词：

Whatever you do don't ever play my canyon  
Too many years being the king of pain  
You gotta lose it all if you wanna take control  
Sell yourself to save your soul  
Rescue me from the demons in my mind  
Rescue me from the lovers in my life  
Rescue me from the demons in my mind  
Rescue me rescue me rescue me  
Rescue me  
Whatever you do don't ever lose your faith  
The devil's quick to love lust and pain  
Better to say yes to never know oh oh  
Sell yourself to save your soul  
Rescue me from the demons in my mind  
Rescue me from the lovers in my life  
Rescue me from the demons in my mind  
Rescue me rescue me rescue me  
Rescue me  
Sell yourself to save your soul you gotta oh oh  
Sell yourself to save your soul you gotta oh oh  
Sell yourself to save your soul you gotta oh oh  
Sell yourself to save your soul  
Rescue me from the demons in my mind  
Rescue me from the lovers in my life  
Rescue me from the demons in my mind  
Rescue me rescue me rescue me  
Rescue me oh oh  
Rescue me oh oh  
Rescue me oh oh  
Rescue me rescue me rescue me
