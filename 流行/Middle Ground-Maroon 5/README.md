美国流行天团“魔力红”Maroon 5携全新单曲《 **Middle Ground**
》强势回归，这是他们继2021所推出的专辑大碟《JORDI》睽违两年的首支新作。

由David Dobkin所执导的歌曲官方音乐录影带将在5月23日上线，Maroon 5也将在「美国好声音」节目之中带来本次新作的首场现场表演。

在《 _Middle Ground_ 》之中，Maroon
5进行了音乐层面的深入潜心探索，与他们过往所缔造的音乐作品存在着鲜明的差异，也会使人感受到他们于2002年所推出的四白金销量的首张乐队专辑《Songs
About Jane》所蕴藏的精神内核。轻柔的不插电吉他韵律与手鼓节奏巧妙于歌曲中相融，Adam Levine卸下心防般的真挚吟唱更是令人动容。

同时，网站还为大家提供了《[ **Memories-Maroon 5**](Music-10856.html "Memories-Maroon
5")》曲谱下载

### Middle Ground歌词：

I need peace I need hope I need guidance  
I need more than myself  
I need light I need life I need what I never felt  
Sisters and brothers are picking sides  
And both of our mothers are terrified  
And I'm crying out to an empty sky  
Tell me  
If I hit the ground  
And I fall down to my knees  
Would you hear the sound  
Am I crazy to think that we  
Could make it out  
Am I crazier to believe  
There's a middle ground  
I'm so up I'm so down I'm so broken  
I'm so tired I can't sleep  
I'm not mine I'm not yours I'm not sure of anything  
Sisters and brothers are picking sides  
And both of our mothers arе terrified  
And I'm crying out to an empty sky  
Tell me  
If I hit the ground  
And I fall down to my knees  
Would you hear the sound  
Am I crazy to think that we  
Could make it out  
Am I crazier to believe  
There's a middle ground  
Middle ground there's a middle ground  
I don't need someone to love  
I just need someone to live for  
Middle ground there's a middle ground  
On my knees where I belong  
Please tell me  
If I hit the ground  
And I fall down to my knees  
Would you hear the sound  
Am I crazy to think that we  
Could ever make it out  
Am I crazier to believe  
There's a middle ground  
Middle ground there's a middle ground  
Oh  
Am I crazier to believe there's a middle ground  
Middle ground there's a middle ground  
Oh  
I need you to believe oh there's a middle ground
