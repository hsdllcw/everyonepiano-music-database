_Runaway Baby_ 是Bruno Mars的一首摇滚曲子，让人热血沸腾!湖南卫视出品的《百变大咖秀》中把此首歌改编，成为其节目的主题曲。

作为2010年美国乐坛的新人王，绰号“火星”的 Bruno
Mars带来了一缕自由春风。在高科技越战越勇的欧美乐坛，他仅用一把吉他闯荡江湖，实在勇气可嘉。冲向风车的唐吉诃德，用肉嗓挑战Auto-
Tune(人工修音)的Bruno Mars，都是真正的猛士，不同的是小“火星”赢了。《Runaway
Baby》是真正的自由之歌，自由不一定要轰轰烈烈，但一定要神清气爽，“火星”曾言，只写简单的流行乐，他说到做到，《Doo-Wops &
Hooligans》发出的口号十分简单：快乐你就跳舞！

### Runaway Baby歌词：

Ahh yes!!!  
Well looky here looky here  
Ah what do we have?  
Another pretty thing ready for me to grab  
But little does she know  
That I'm a wolf in sheeps clothing  
'Cause at the end of the night  
It is her I'll be holding  
I love you so  
That's what you'll say  
You'll tell me  
Baby baby please don't go away  
But when I play, I never stay  
To every girl that I meet here this is what I say:  
Run run run away, run away baby  
Before I put my spell on you  
You better get get get away get away darling  
'Cause everything you heard is true  
Your poor little heart will end up alone  
'Cause lord knows I'm a rolling stone  
So you better run run run away run away baby  
Well let me think let me think  
Ah what should I do?  
So many eager young bunny's  
That I'd like to pursue  
Now even now they eating out the palm of my hand  
There's only one carrot and they all gotta share it  
I love you so  
That's what you'll say  
You'll tell me  
Baby baby please don't go away  
But when I play, I never stay  
To every girl that I meet here this is what I say:  
Run run run away, run away baby  
Before I put my spell on you  
You better get get get away get away darling  
'Cause everything you heard is true  
Your poor little heart will end up alone  
'Cause lord knows I'm a rolling stone  
So you better run run run away run away baby  
See I ain't try to hurt you baby  
No no, no I just wanna work you baby  
Yup yup  
See I ain't try to hurt you baby  
No no, no I just wanna work you baby  
If you scared you better run (You better run)  
You better run (You better run)  
You better run (You better run)  
You better you better you better  
Run run run away, run away baby  
Before I put my spell on you  
You better get get get away get away darling  
'Cause everything you heard is true  
Your poor little heart will end up alone  
'Cause lord knows I'm a rolling stone  
So you better run run run away run away baby!
