### Slow Down歌词：

Oooooo Baby  
There's something that I gotta tell ya  
I think that you should know what's on my mind  
Ooo baby I'm feelin our situation  
Is getting stronger how we want it  
But I gotta take my time  
There is so much about you that I want to explore  
Physical attraction, we just can't ignore it,  
But before we go too far across the line  
Gotta really make sure that I'm sure

[Chorus:]

Slow down baby, let's take our time  
Slow down baby, if you don't mind  
Slow down baby, before we make this move  
Slow down baby, baby slow down  
Cause b4 we make this move  
I think it's really 2 soon  
Oooo baby it's like I'm knowing you forever  
My medulla oblongata electrified  
Oooo baby whenever we're alone 2gether  
Bout to explode and it feels so right  
But I gotta take my time.  
There is so much about you that I want to explore  
Physical attraction, we just can't ignore it,  
But before we go too far across the line  
Gotta really make sure that I'm sure

[Chorus:]

Slow down baby, let's take our time  
Slow down baby, if you don't mind  
Slow down baby, before we make this move  
Slow down baby, baby slow down  
Cause b4 we make this move  
Baby it's really 2 soon  
Soon, yeah....  
See I know what is best, cause I've been there before  
Gave myself to someone for all the wrong reasons  
But this time around, I don't want to do that again  
I just want to make this the way that I've dreamed of  
So baby you gotta...

[Chorus:]

Slow down baby, let's take our time  
Slow down baby, if you don't mind  
Slow down baby, before we make this move  
Slow down baby, baby slow down  
Cause b4 we make this move  
I think it's really 2 soon  
Slow down  
You gotta slow down  
You gotta slow down  
Baby slow down  
You gotta slow down  
You gotta slow down  
You gotta slow down [and out]
