### SOS歌词：

Where are those happy days they seem so hard to find  
I tried to reach for you but you have closed your mind  
Whatever happened to our love I wish I understood  
It used to be so nice it used to be so good  
So when you're near me darling can't you hear me S. O. S  
The love you gave me nothing else can save me S. O. S  
When you're gone how can I even try to go on  
When you're gone though I try how can I carry on  
You seem so far away though you are standing near  
You made me feel alive but something died I fear  
I really tried to make it out I wish I understood  
What happened to our love it used to be so good  
So when you're near me darling can't you hear me S. O. S  
The love you gave me nothing else can save me S. O. S  
When you're gone how can I even try to go on  
When you're gone though I try how can I carry on  
So when you're near me darling can't you hear me S. O. S  
The love you gave me nothing else can save me S. O. S  
When you're gone how can I even try to go on  
When you're gone though I try how can I carry on  
When you're gone how can I even try to go on  
When you're gone though I try how can I carry on
