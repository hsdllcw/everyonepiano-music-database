### Happy Birthday 歌词：

Beautiful, beautiful, no other name  
I knew from the moment you came  
I've seen in your eyes the dawn of a day  
Where nothing will ever be the same

Feel my heart beating through my chest  
I'll get used to just saying "yes"  
Yes, I'll love you with all I am  
Yes, tonight is where we begin

Ooh, I wanna dance with you  
Ooh, I'll promise to stand for you  
I'll do anything for you  
Oh yeah, oh yeah  
Tonight, my love all I want  
I wanna sing for you  
Yeah, I'll sing for you  
Happy birthday, baby  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday, baby  
Happy birthday to you

Love you, in love for the rest of my days  
Pray you'll find joy through your pain  
I can't protect you from every heartbreak  
The world isn't easy that way

But I'll be there for you when you crawl  
Then I'll pick you up when you fall  
Yes, I'll love you with all I am  
Yes, tonight is where we begin

Ooh, I wanna dance with you  
Ooh, I'll promise to stand for you  
I'll do anything for you  
Oh yeah, oh yeah  
Tonight, my love all I want  
I wanna sing for you  
Yeah, I'll sing for you  
Happy birthday, baby  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday, baby  
Happy birthday to you

Beautiful, beautiful, no other name  
I knew from the moment you came
