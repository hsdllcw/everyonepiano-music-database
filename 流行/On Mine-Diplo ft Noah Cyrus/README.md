### On Mine歌词：

Imagine what we could what we could be  
Breathing in breathing in breathing in breathe  
Feel this what a great what a great mood  
Of you  
Don't run 'cause when we run oh we run deep  
Cling to cling to me when you can't sleep  
Don't let this be the last be the last one  
Hmm be the last one  
'Cause I really wanna know you better  
Wanna put your lips on mine  
On mine on mine on mine on mine  
I wanna get to know each other  
Wanna feel your skin on mine  
On mine on mine on mine  
On mine on mine  
On mine  
On mine on mine  
On mine  
Love on on my skin  
Keep it that way  
Maybe it will be  
Be enough to stay  
Oh can you see the potential in this  
Oh can you see it  
'Cause I really wanna know you better  
Wanna put your lips on mine  
On mine on mine on mine on mine  
I wanna get to know each other  
Wanna feel your skin on mine  
On mine on mine on mine  
On mine on mine  
On mine  
On mine on mine  
On mine  
On mine on mine  
On mine  
On mine on mine  
On mine yeah  
'Cause I don't know if I can walk this world alone  
Yeah I don't know if I can do it  
Baby tell me  
Oh can you see the potential in this  
Oh can you see it  
'Cause I really wanna know you better  
Wanna put your lips on mine  
On mine on mine on mine on mine  
I wanna get to know each other  
Oh oh  
Wanna feel your skin on mine  
On mine on mine on mine  
On mine on mine  
On mine  
On mine on mine  
On mine
