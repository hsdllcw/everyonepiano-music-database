### Like This歌词：

I been through too much just to live like this  
Double up my cup you can't sip like this  
I fill my pockets 'til they stuffed so they fit like this  
Now she know I'm up 'cause I drip like this  
Now I won't give a f**k let it rip like this  
Hop up in my truck and I whip like this  
And now they know I'm up 'cause my wrist like this  
No I can't get enough 'cause I'm sick like this yeah  
I been through too much just to live like this  
I been through too much just to live like this  
I fill my pockets 'til they stuffed so they fit like this  
I been through too much just to live like this  
Copped another Rollie but it ain't a Plain Jane  
N***as call the police but be screamin'  
Gang gang  
Boy stop actin' like you know me when you know you can't hang  
That's my brothеr not my homie nah that ain't the same thing  
And for buster I'm gon ride 'cause we feel the same pain  
Like no other do or die even when the days rain  
From the gutter that's no lie we on the same page  
From the bottom now we ballin' like the Wayne way  
I been through too much just to live like this  
Double up my cup you can't sip like this  
I fill my pockets 'til they stuffed so they fit like this  
Now she know I'm up 'cause I drip like this  
I been through too much just to live like this  
I been through too much just to live like this  
I fill my pockets 'til they stuffed so they fit like this  
I been through too much just to live like this  
Phone ring I decline it I don't know why they whinin'  
I ain't ask I'm just chiming real n***as move in silence  
Amiri jeans and Balenciagas  
Always believed in our dreams now we got them dollars  
If you ain't pleased baby please tell me what's the problem  
Yeah I'm a fiend for the cream like a Baskin Robbin  
Now just don't leave me in the street 'cause I go back to robbin'  
This for the team ain't have a thing and now we got it poppin'  
I been through too much just to live like this  
Double up my cup you can't sip like this  
I fill my pockets 'til they stuffed so they fit like this  
Now she know I'm up 'cause I drip like this  
Now I won't give a f**k let it rip like this  
Hop up in my truck and I whip like this  
And now they know I'm up 'cause my wrist like this  
Though I can get enough 'cause my fit like this  
I been through too much just to live like this  
I been through too much just to live like this  
I fill my pockets 'til they stuffed so they fit like this  
I been through too much just to live like this  
Like this like this  
Like this like this  
Like this like this  
Ooh no yeah
