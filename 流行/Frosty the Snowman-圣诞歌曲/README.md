### Frosty the Snowman歌词：

Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul  
With a corncob pipe and a button nose  
and two eyes made out of coal  
Frosty the snowman is a fairytale they say  
He was made of snow but the children  
know how he came to life one day  
There must have been some magic in that  
old silk hat they found  
For when they placed it on his head  
he began to dance around

Oh  
Frosty the snowman  
was alive as he could be  
And the children say he could laugh  
and play just the same as you and me  
Thumpity thump thump  
thumpity thump thump  
Look at Frosty go  
Thumpity thump thump  
thumpity thump thump  
Over the hills of snow

Frosty the snowman knew  
the sun was hot that day  
So he said  
Let's run and  
we'll have some fun  
now before I melt away  
Down to the village  
with a broomstick in his hand  
Running here and there all  
around the square saying  
Catch me if you can  
He led them down the streets of town  
right to the traffic cop  
And he only paused a moment when  
he heard him holler "Stop!"  
For Frosty the snow man  
had to hurry on his way  
But he waved goodbye saying  
Don't you cry  
I'll be back again some day  
thumpity thump thump  
thumpity thump thump  
Look at Frosty go  
thumpity thump thump  
thumpity thump thump  
Over the hills of snow
