**You Don't Know My Name** 是Alicia Keys的歌曲，收录在专辑The Diary of Alicia
Keys中。此曲是她石破天惊成名作"Fallin'"的续曲，但这首同样展现出艾莉西亚精湛钢琴功力的歌曲，相较于"Fallin'"的澎湃情感，显得更为深切而刻骨铭心，尽管全曲有6分多钟长，然而艾莉西亚细腻的吟唱配合行云流水般的钢琴伴奏，丝毫不会让人感觉到时间的流淌，她能够魔幻般的令人融入诗意的歌词意境中，顺理成章地成为专辑的第一主打单曲。

专辑的音乐方面，Alicia Keys更是没有让人失望，这张由各路精英打造出来的专辑证明了Alicia
Keys并没有被五项葛莱美奖杯的压力所压倒，除了以其拥有的似乎无限的音乐才华继续创作出了以" _You Don't Know My Name_
"为代表的这样优秀的单曲以外，并且还继续展现着自己卓越的演奏才能。

### You Don't Know My Name歌词：

Baby, baby, baby  
From the day I saw you  
I really really want to catch your eye  
There's something special 'bout you  
I must really like you  
Cause not a lotta guys are worth my time  
Ooo baby, baby, baby  
It's gettin kind of crazy  
Cause you are takin over my mind  
And it feels like oooooo  
But you don't know my name  
And I swear it feels like ooooo ooooo ooooo ooooo  
You don't know my name  
(round and round and round we go, will you ever know)

Oh baby baby baby  
I see us on our first date  
You're doin everything that makes me smile  
And when we had our first kiss  
It happened on a Thursday  
Ooooo it set my soul on fire  
Ooo baby baby baby  
I can't wait for the first time  
My imagination's runnin wild  
It feels like ooooo  
You don't know my name  
And I swear it baby, it feels like oooo ooooo ooooo ooooo  
You don't know my name  
(round and round and round we go, will you ever know)

Got me feelin' all crazy inside  
I'm feelin like"  
Owww! Ooooo Oooooo  
Doin more than I've ever done for anyone's attention  
Take notice of what's in front of you  
Cause did I mention you're 'bout to miss a good thing  
And you'll never know how good it feels to have all of my affection  
And you'll never get a chance to experience my lovin'  
Cause my lovin' feels like ooooooo  
You don't know my name  
(round and round and round we go, will you ever know  
And I swear it feels like oooo ooooo ooooo ooooo  
You don't know my name  
(round and round and round we go, will you ever know)  
Ohhh

Will you ever know it, no no no no no  
Will you ever know it?  
"I'm gonna have to just go ahead and call this boy.  
Hello? Can I speak to -- to Michael?  
Oh hey, how you doin?  
Uh, I feel kinda silly doin' this,  
But um, this is the waitress from the coffee house on 39th and Lennox  
You know, the one with the braids?  
Yeah, well I see you on Wednesdays all the time  
You come in every Wednesday on your lunch break, I think  
And you always order the special, with the hot chocolate  
And my manager be tripping and stuff  
Talking bout we gotta use water  
But I always use some milk and cream for you  
Cause I think you're kinda sweet.  
Anyway you always got on some fly blue suit  
'n your cufflinks are shining all bright  
So, whatchu do? Oh, word? Yeah, that's interesting  
Look man, I mean I don't wanna waste your time but  
I know girls don't usually do this,  
But I was wondering if maybe we could get together  
Outside the restaurant one day  
Cause I do look a lot different outside my work clothes  
I mean we could just go across the street to the park right here  
Wait, hold up, my cell phone's breakin up, hold up  
Can you hear me now? Yeah  
So, what day did you say?  
Oh yeah, Thursday's perfect, man:."  
And it feels like oooo  
You don't know my name  
(round and round and round we go, will you ever know)  
Baby Baby I swear it's like oooooo  
You don't know my name, no no no  
(round and round and round we go, will you ever know)  
And it feels like oooo  
You don't know my name  
(round and round and round we go, will you ever know)  
And I swear on my mother and father it feels like  
Oooo ooo oooo ooo ooo ooo  
Oooo ooo oooo ooo ooo ooo  
Oooo ooo oooo ooo ooo ooo  
You don't know my name  
(round and round and round we go, will you ever know?)
