**Fine Line双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Fine Line_ 是英国男歌手Harry Styles演唱的歌曲。收录在其同名专辑Fine Line中。专辑于2019年12月13日通过Erskine
Records和哥伦比亚唱片公司共同发行。而此专辑最令人着迷的地方，恰恰是关于25岁的真实反映，情绪不断波动，孤独、悲伤和愤怒，都是不可避免的；Harry也丝毫没有去避免探讨这些，他自知并自省。

### Fine Line歌词：

Put a price on emotion  
I'm looking for something to buy  
You've got my devotion  
But man I can hate you sometimes  
I don't want to fight you  
And I don't want to sleep in the dirt  
We'll get the drinks in so I'll get to thinking of her  
We'll be a fine line  
We'll be a fine line  
We'll be a fine line  
We'll be a fine line  
We'll be a fine line  
We'll be a fine line  
Test of my patience  
There's things that we'll never know  
You sunshine you temptress  
My hand's at risk I fold  
Crisp trepidation  
I'll try to shake this soon  
Spreading you open is the only way of knowing you  
We'll be a fine line  
We'll be a fine line  
We'll be a fine line  
We'll be a fine line  
We'll be a fine line  
We'll be a fine line  
We'll be a fine line  
We'll be a fine line  
We'll be a fine line  
We'll be a fine line  
We'll be a fine line  
We'll be a fine line  
We'll be alright  
We'll be alright  
We'll be a fine line  
We'll be a fine line  
We'll be alright  
Alright alright alright  
We'll be alright  
We'll be alright  
We'll be alright  
We'll be alright  
Oh
