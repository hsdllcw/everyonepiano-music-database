### Nobody but You歌词：

Don't have to leave this town to see the world  
'Cause it's something that I gotta do  
I don't wanna look back in 30 years  
And wonder who you're married to  
Wanna say it now wanna make it clear  
For only you and God to hear  
When you love someone they say you set 'em free  
But that ain't gonna work for me  
I don't wanna live without you  
I don't wanna even breathe  
I don't wanna dream about you  
Wanna wake up with you next to me  
I don't wanna go down any other road now  
I don't wanna love nobody but you  
Lookin' in your eyes now if I had to die now  
I don't wanna love nobody but you  
You  
All the wasted days all the wasted nights  
I blame it all on being young  
Got no regrets 'cause it got me here  
But I don't wanna waste another one  
I been thinkin' about what I want in my life  
It begins and ends the same  
If I had to choose what I couldn't lose  
There'd only be one thing  
I don't wanna live without you  
I don't wanna even breathe  
I don't wanna dream about you  
Wanna wake up with you next to me  
I don't wanna go down any other road now  
I don't wanna love nobody but you  
Lookin' in your eyes now if I had to die now  
I don't wanna love nobody but you  
You  
I don't wanna love nobody but you  
You  
Wanna say it now wanna make it clear  
For only you and God to hear  
I don't wanna live without you  
I don't wanna even breathe  
I don't wanna dream about you  
Wanna wake up with you next to me  
Next to me  
I don't wanna go down any other road now  
I don't wanna love nobody but you  
I don't wanna love nobody  
Lookin' in your eyes now if I had to die now  
I don't wanna love nobody but you  
You  
I don't wanna love nobody but you  
You  
I don't wanna love nobody but you
