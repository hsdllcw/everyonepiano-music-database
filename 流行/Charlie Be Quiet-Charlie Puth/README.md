### Charlie Be Quiet!歌词：

Charlie be quiet don't make a sound  
You got to lower the noise a little bit now  
If she knows you're in love she's gonna run run away-ay-ay-ay  
I'm not making the same mistake  
Won't be putting my heart on display  
I'll just water my feelings down  
I'm not going out looking dumb  
Telling all my friends that you're the one  
Those words never leavin' my mouth  
But the feeling gets  
Stronger baby what am I gonna do now  
When you text me  
'Cause I'm talking too loud  
Charlie be quiet don't make a sound  
You've got to lower the noise a littlе bit now  
If she knows you're in love she's gonna run run away-ay-ay-ay  
Charlie be quiet don't make a sound  
You've got to lower the noise a little bit now  
If she knows you're in love she's gonna run run away-ay-ay-ay  
I'm not gonna do more than like won't sleeping over every night  
Act like I don't even care yeah  
I'm not going out looking dumb  
Tellin' all my friends I've found someone  
Then wakin' up without you there but the feeling gets  
Stronger baby what am I gonna do now  
When you text me  
'Cause I'm talking too loud  
Charlie be quiet don't make a sound  
You've got to lower the noise a little bit now  
If she knows you're in love she's gonna run run away-ay-ay-ay  
Charlie be quiet don't make a sound  
You've got to lower the noise a little bit now  
If she knows you're in love she's gonna run run away-ay-ay-ay  
If she knows you're in love she's gonna run run away-ay-ay-ay
