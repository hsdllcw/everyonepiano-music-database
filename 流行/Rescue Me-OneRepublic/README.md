### Rescue Me歌词：

Would you rescue me  
Would you get my back  
Would you take my call when I start to crack  
Would you rescue me  
Huh  
Would you rescue me  
Would you rescue me when I'm by myself  
When I need your love if I need your help  
Would you rescue me  
Huh  
Would you rescue me  
We don't talk much not anymore  
Broken bottles and slammin' doors  
But we still care about each other  
Say we care about each other  
I know life took us far away  
But I still dream 'bout the good old days  
When we took care of each other  
We were living for each other  
But I start to wonder wonder  
If I'm slipping under under  
Oh oh  
Would you rescue me  
Would you get my back  
Would you take my call when I start to crack  
Would you rescue me  
Huh  
Would you rescue me  
Would you rescue me when I'm by myself  
When I need your love if I need your help  
Would you rescue me  
Huh  
Would you rescue me  
Would you rescue me  
Would you get my back  
Would you take my call when I start to crack  
Would you rescue me  
Huh  
Would you rescue me  
Would you rescue me  
Would you rescue me when I'm by myself  
When I need your love if I need your help  
Would you rescue me  
Huh  
Would you rescue me  
Yeah I miss all the times we had  
Can't forget what you can't get back  
And you can't find it in another  
Man time it ain't your lover  
I don't care what you thought before  
I'll be there anytime you call  
Don't you ever call another  
No need to call another  
And I start to wonder wonder  
If I'm slipping under under  
Oh oh  
Would you rescue me  
Would you get my back  
Would you take my call when I start to crack  
Would you rescue me  
Huh  
Would you rescue me  
Would you rescue me  
Would you rescue me when I'm by myself  
When I need your love if I need your help  
Would you rescue me  
Huh  
Would you rescue me  
Yeah  
Would you rescue me  
Oh rescue me  
Would you rescue me  
Would you rescue me  
Oh rescue me  
Would you rescue me  
Would you rescue me  
Would you get my back  
Would you take my call when I start to crack  
Would you rescue me  
Huh  
Would you rescue me  
Would you rescue me when I'm by myself  
When I need your love if I need your help  
Would you rescue me  
Huh  
Would you rescue me
