### Never Not歌词：

We were so beautiful  
We were so tragic  
No other magic could ever compare  
Lost myself seventeen  
Then you came found me  
No other magic could ever compare  
There's a room  
In my heart with the memories we made  
Took 'em down but they're still in their frames  
There's no way I could ever forget mmm  
For as long as I live and as long as I love  
I will never not think about you  
You mmm  
I will never not think about you  
From the moment I loved I knew you were the one  
And no matter what I-I do ooh mmm  
I will never not think about you  
What we had only comes  
Once in a lifetime  
For the rest of mine always compare  
To the room  
In my heart with the memories we made  
Nights on fifth inbetween b and a  
There's no way I could ever forget mmm  
For as long as I live and as long as I love  
I will never not think about you  
You mmm  
I will never not think about you  
From the moment I loved I knew you were the one  
And no matter what I-I do ooh mmm  
I will never not think about you  
Didn't we have fun  
Didn't we have fun looking back  
Didn't we have fun  
Didn't we have fun  
Didn't we have fun  
Didn't we have fun looking back  
Didn't we have fun  
Didn't we have fun  
We were so beautiful  
We were so tragic  
No other magic could ever compare
