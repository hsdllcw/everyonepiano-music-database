**Daughters** 是John Mayer第三张录音室专辑《Heavier
Things》中的歌曲，2005年第47届格莱美奖年度最佳单曲，凭借此曲，John Mayer获得最佳男歌手。

这张专辑由美国著名的唱片制作人Jack Joseph Puig全权打造，这位曾经为包括Eric
Clapton等许多大牌歌星和乐队担任制作人的老手已经把John Mayer多年的老搭档John
Alagia挤走了。然而这张专辑确实没有让人失望，不仅商业上获得丰收，而且还赢得了苛刻的美国乐评界一致的好评。这是一张非常成熟的专辑，虽然没有过分的宣传和包装，但是专辑的歌曲流露出制作人的精心和细腻，快节奏时的微调，以及旋律转变的谐和等等，使得歌曲显得自然流畅。与过去的歌曲相比，新专辑中的歌曲更富有张力，从硬到柔，从快到慢，悦耳的旋律和真实的歌词被John
Mayer拿捏的非常到位，而且歌词也比以往更有深度。

### Daughters歌词：

I know a girl  
She puts the color inside of my world  
But she's just like a maze  
Where all of the walls all continually change  
And I've done all I can  
To stand on her steps with my heart in my hands  
Now I'm starting to see  
Maybe it's got nothing to do with me

Fathers, be good to your daughters  
Daughters will love like you do  
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers  
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

Oh, you see that skin?  
It's the same she's been standing in  
Since the day she saw him walking away  
Now she's left  
Cleaning up the mess he made

So fathers, be good to your daughters  
Daughters will love like you do  
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers  
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

Boys, you can break  
You'll find out how much they can take  
Boys will be strong  
And boys soldier on  
But boys would be gone without the warmth from  
A womans good, good heart

On behalf of every man  
Looking out for every girl  
You are the god and the weight of her world

So fathers, be good to your daughters  
Daughters will love like you do  
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers  
So mothers, be good to your daughters too [x3]
