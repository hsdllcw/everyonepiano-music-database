**Mele Kalikimaka双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Mele Kalikimaka_ 是夏威夷人过圣诞节时的祝福语Merry Christmas（圣诞快乐），此曲由R. Alex
Anderson于1949年创作。1950年，首次被Bing Crosby和the Andrews Sisters演唱。

在1820年之前，夏威夷从来不庆祝圣诞节。当库克船长和他的船员们抵达这里后，便把庆祝圣诞节的习俗带到了夏威夷。夏威夷把圣诞节叫作“Kalikimaka”，是英文Christmas的音译。因此圣诞快乐就是“Mele
Kalikimaka”。伴随着冬日的阳光和愉悦的心情，在这温暖的圣诞，一起说“Mele Kalikimaka”吧!

### Mele Kalikimaka歌词：

Mele Kalikimaka is the thing to say on a bright Hawian Christmas Day  
That's the island greeting that we send to you from the land where palm trees
sway  
Here we know that Christmas will be green and bright  
The sun to shine by day and all the stars at night  
Mele Kalikimaka is Hawaii's way to say Merry Christmas to you  
THe Andrew Sisters  
Mele Kalikimaka is the thing to say on a bright Hawian Christmas day  
That's the island greeting that we send to you from the land where palm trees
sway  
Here we know that Christmas will be green and bright  
The sun to shine by day and all the stars at night  
Mele Kalikimaka is Hawaii's way to say Merry Christmas to you  
The Andrew Sister's and Bing Crosby  
Here we know that Christmas will be green and bright  
The sun to shine by day and all the stars at night  
Mele Kalikimaka is Hawaii's way to say Merry Christmas to you  
Mele Kalikimaka is the thing to say on a bright Hawian Christmas Day  
Thats the island greeting that we send to you from the land where palm trees
