### Love to Go歌词：

Livin' in the fast lane time is precious  
I'm countin' down the seconds I can feel you on my skin  
I go in this direction I'm sorry that yours is different  
And it's turnin' up within  
You can't keep movin' back and forth  
I'll go my way you go yours  
Lost in the middle of it all  
Will things be the same when I come back  
Don't forget you told me that  
You'll always pick up pick up when I call  
I'll take our love to go  
I'll take our love to go  
'Cause everywhere I go you'll be my home  
I'll take our love to go  
I'll take our love to go  
No matter where I go you'll be my home  
I'll take our love to go  
No matter where I go  
I'll take our love to go  
You'll be my home  
I'll take our love to go  
No matter where I go  
I'll take our love to go  
You'll be my home  
All in you give me Heaven  
I got no hesitation after dealin' with the tears  
Can feel the radiation of my feelings  
I can give them a meanin' but I know that you're worth the risk  
You can't keep movin' back and forth  
I'll go my way you go yours  
Lost in the middle of it all  
Will things be the same when I come back  
Don't forget you told me that  
You'll always pick up pick up when I call  
I'll take our love to go  
I'll take our love to go  
'Cause everywhere I go you'll be my home  
I'll take our love to go  
I'll take our love to go  
No matter where I go you'll be my home  
I'll take our love to go  
No matter where I go  
I'll take our love to go  
You'll be my home  
I'll take our love to go  
No matter where I go  
I'll take our love to go  
You'll be my home  
I'll take our love to go  
Love to go  
No matter where I go  
Love to go  
I'll take our love to go  
Love to go  
You'll be my home  
Love to go  
I'll take our love to go  
Love to go  
No matter where I go  
Love to go  
I'll take our love to go  
Love to go  
You'll be my home
