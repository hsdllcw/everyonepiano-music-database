### Dark Necessities歌词：

Coming on to the light of day we got  
Many moons that are deep at play so I  
Keep an eye on the shadow smile  
To see what it has to say  
You and I both know  
Everything must go away  
What do you say?

Spinning off, head is on my heart  
It's like a bit of light in a touch of dark  
You got sneak attack from the zodiac  
But I see your fire spark  
Keep the breeze and go  
Blow by blow and go away  
What do you say?  
Yeah

You don't know my mind  
You don't know my kind  
Dark necessities are part of my design  
And tell the world that I'm  
Falling from the sky  
Dark necessities are part of my design

Stumble down to the parking lot  
You got no time for the afterthought  
They're like ice cream for an astronaut  
Well, that's me looking for weed  
Turn the corner  
And find the world at your command  
Playing the hand  
Yeah

You don't know my mind  
You don't know my kind  
Dark necessities are part of my design  
Tell the world that I'm  
Falling from the sky  
Dark necessities are part of my design

Do you want this love of mine?  
Darkness helps us all to shine  
Do you want it, do you want it now?

Do you want it all the time?  
But darkness helps us all to shine  
Do you want it, do you want it now?

Pick you up like a paper back with the  
Track record of a maniac so I  
Move it in and we unpack  
It's the same as yesterday  
Any way we roll  
Everything must go away  
What do you say? Yeah

You don't know my mind  
You don't know my kind  
Dark necessities are part of my design

Tell the world that I'm  
Falling from the sky and  
Dark necessities are part of my design
