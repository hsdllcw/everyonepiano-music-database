### My Way歌词：

[Hook:]  
Baby, won't you come my way?  
Got something I want to say  
Cannot keep you out my brain  
But first off I'mma start by saying this, ayy  
All headshots if you think you could take my bitch, ayy  
And I'm too turnt, when I shoot, swear I won't miss, ayy  
Ba-Baby, won't you come my way?  
Baby, won't you come my way?

Ba-Ba-Baby  
This is something you should know, I don't ever chase no hoes  
I spotted you, you had that glow, watch me pull out all this dough  
Take you where you want to go, flexing on your ex, I know  
He ain't ever take you out, barely even left your house  
How dare that nigga run his mouth when his pockets in a drought  
The last single he put out didn't even make it out  
And he dumb as hell and I swear his ass don't think, ayy  
If he disrespect, two shots and I won't blink, ayy  
Never really cared what the fuck these niggas think, ayy  
I got deep pockets and I swear my shit's on sink, ayy  
And he mad as fuck, big ZooWap all she sing, ayy  
And he mad as fuck, big ZooWap in her dreams, ayy  
Well he mad as fuck when they sex she scream for me, ayy  
Big ZooWap what these niggas should be, ayy

[Hook]

[Monty:]  
Baby girl, you can stay the night 'till the morn'  
All this ice on my arm  
What you like, what you want?  
And I might put you on  
Bitch, it's mine can't you see?  
And I rock seventeen  
All these knots in my jeans  
Me and Zoo turnin' up  
Got your boo in the cut  
And she sue cause it's looking like the roof going up  
Counting all this bread, I don't talk to feds  
Try and take my bitch, you gonna take two to the head  
Cause baby you the baddest  
All this money, I'mma cash it  
And I'm swervin' all in traffic  
While I'm trapping out the mansion  
And I'm moving through the tri-state  
Do two-hundred on the highway  
And I'm swerving in my i8  
Baby, you should come my way  
Squad!
