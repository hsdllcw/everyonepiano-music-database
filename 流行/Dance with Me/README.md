### Dance with Me歌词：

Thomas Rhett：  
Had another dream 'bout you  
These days only thing I do  
We been standin' in the same road  
People talkin' but I don't want to  
Sing in one ear and out the other  
I see you lookin' at me but you're with another  
Goes in one ear and out the other  
Both eyes open and I can hear 'em sayin'  
Dance with me dance with me  
Play that song like baby one two three  
Come here close and give me your body  
Let's take it so far so far there's nowhere left to go  
Dance with me dance with me  
Play that song like baby one two three  
Come here close and give me your body  
Let's take it so far so far there's nowhere left to go  
Thomas Rhett/Young Thug：  
Na-na-na-na na-na-na-na  
Na-na-na-na nowhere left to go  
Na-na-na-na na-na-na-na  
Na-na-na-na  
Young Thug：  
Na-na-na-na na-na-na-na  
Na-na  
Heard you read the text and didn't reply  
Looked your name up in the index and I didn't know why  
Had no choice but let you splurge and baby yeah I  
Once wanted to buy a chopper not no ten-speed  
Ten-speed  
I move this way without the ten-speed  
Ten-speed  
I wanna know if you was into me  
Or you just saw me with my equations up by decis  
Thomas Rhett：  
Dance with me dance with me  
Play that song like baby one two three  
Come here close and give me your body  
Let's take it so far so far there's nowhere left to go  
Dance with me dance with me  
Play that song like baby one two three  
Come here close and give me your body  
Let's take it so far so far this girl I got to know  
Thomas Rhett/Young Thug：  
Na-na-na-na na-na-na-na  
Na-na-na-na nowhere left to go  
Na-na-na-na na-na-na-na  
Na-na-na-na  
Thomas Rhett：  
Started two strangers on the back of a bus  
Had a good time and a heck of a rush  
Sometimes a memory is never enough  
It's never enough it's never enough no  
Started two strangers in the back of the bus  
Had a good time and a heck of a rush  
Sometimes a memory is never enough  
It's never enough it's never enough no  
Dance with me dance with me  
Play that song like baby one two three  
Come here close and give me your body  
Let's take it so far so far there's nowhere left to go  
Na-na-na-na na-na-na-na  
Na-na-na-na nowhere left to go  
Na-na-na-na na-na-na-na  
Na-na-na-na  
Nowhere left to go  
Na-na-na-na na-na-na-na  
Na-na-na-na nowhere left to go  
Na-na  
Na-na-na-na na-na-na-na  
Na-na-na-na nowhere left to go  
Young Thug：  
Oh oh oh oh
