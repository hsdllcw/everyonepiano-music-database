### Call It Love歌词：

Sing it back to me sing it back to me now  
Why don't we call it love call it love  
Two hearts in a billion  
One of all into ya  
Make me wanna shout it out  
Like a hallelujah  
'Cause time like these  
Times like these don't come and go  
We're two hearts in a billion  
Singing hallelujah  
Hey there's somethin' in the air tonight  
Way up in the blaze of gold  
Hey there's somethin'  
In the air tonight uh uh uh  
Say I feel it in the sky above  
The way down in the waves below  
Hey I feel it in the sky above  
Why don't we call it love yeah  
Sing it back to me  
Sing it back to me now yeah  
Why don't we call it love call it love yeah  
Sing it back to me  
Sing it back to me now yeah yeah  
Why don't we call it love call it love  
Why don't we call it love call it love  
Why don't we call it love call it love  
No sleep runnin' on a dream  
Down the golden coastline  
You give me all I need  
I'm like oh-my oh-my  
'Cause time like these  
Times like these don't come and go  
No sleep runnin' on a dream  
I'm like oh-my oh-my  
Hey there's somethin' in the air tonight  
Way up in the blaze of gold  
Hey there's somethin'  
In the air tonight uh uh uh  
Say I feel it in the sky above  
The way down in the waves below  
Hey I feel it in the sky above  
Why don't we call it love yeah  
Sing it back to me sing it back to me now yeah  
Why don't we call it love call it love yeah  
Sing it back to me
