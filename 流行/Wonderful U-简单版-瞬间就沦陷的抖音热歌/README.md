《 **Wonderful U**
》是AGA（江海迦）于2016年03月14日由环球唱片发行的歌曲。整首歌词好像诉说的是一个女生在爱情中深陷。感受到真爱的不可思议。但同时男生给她的爱并不够，她并不是很确定男生对她是不是也有同样深沉热烈的爱。

人们往往就是这样，拥有一段感情时，感觉不到它的珍贵，认为没什么值得去爱护和珍惜。更有甚者不但不去重视，还会肆意的挥霍，直到把双方的爱和耐心都消磨殆尽，走向分手！

情深缘浅，一别两宽。便是这首歌所表达的意思了。

所以小编呼吁大家，一定要懂得珍惜，不要等到失去后，才后悔！

### Wonderful U歌词：

I never knew  
When the clock stopped and I'm looking at you  
I never thought I'll miss someone like you  
Someone I thought that I knew  
I never knew  
I should have known something wouldn't be true  
Baby you know that I'm so into you  
More than I know I should do  
So why why why  
Why should we waited  
And I I I  
I should be waiting  
Waiting for someone new  
Even though that it wasn't you  
But I know that it's  
Wonderful  
Incredible  
Baby irrational  
I never knew it was obsessional  
And I never knew it was with you oooh  
Baby if it's just  
Wonderful  
Incredible  
Baby irrational  
I never knew it was so sad  
Just so sad  
I'm so sorry  
Even now I just cannot feel you feel me  
Hmmm  
Hmmm  
So why why why  
Why should we waited  
And I I I  
I should be waiting  
Waiting for someone new  
Even though that it wasn't you  
But I know that it's  
Wonderful  
Incredible  
Baby irrational  
I never knew it was obsessional  
And I never knew it was with you oooh  
Baby if it's just  
Wonderful  
Incredible  
Baby irrational  
I never knew it was so sad  
Just so sad  
I'm so sorry  
Even now I just cannot feel you fall  
I don't even know now  
I'm sure you'll wait for me  
Even now I just cannot deny  
I just hold on so tight  
Until you and I never could breathe  
Oh  
Wonderful  
Incredible  
Baby irrational  
I never knew it was obsessional  
And I never knew it was with you until you tell me to  
Baby if it's just  
Wonderful  
Incredible  
Baby irrational  
I never knew it was so sad  
Just so sad  
I'm so sorry  
Even now I just cannot feel you feel me
