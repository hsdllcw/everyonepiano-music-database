Cooper，开创新民谣风格的艺人，与Alax Kane组成Electric President并且在04年发行同名专辑《Electric
President》。这张11首歌曲的《Ghost》可以说代表了他个人的民谣思想。宁静，不嘈杂，生活的真实。专辑中稍带一些Lo-
fi和实验的味道，将人声，童声，风声，生活中的脚步声，开门声，风铃声，自然中的鸟声等等一些生活中的声音以音乐的方式加入歌曲中。

### Welcome Home歌词：

Sleep don't visit so I choke on sun  
And the days blur into one  
And the backs of my eyes hum with things I've never done  
Sheets are swaying from an old clothesline  
Like a row of captured ghosts over old dead grass  
Was never much but we made the most  
Welcome home  
Ships are launching from my chest  
Some have names but most do not  
You find If one please let me know what piece I've lost  
Heal the scars from off my back  
I don't need them anymore  
You can throw them out or keep them in your mason jars  
I've come home  
All my nightmares escaped my head  
Bar the door please don't let them in  
You were never supposed to leave  
Now my head's splitting at the seams  
And I don't know if I can  
Here beneath my lungs  
I feel your thumbs press into my skin again
