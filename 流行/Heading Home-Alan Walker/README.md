**Heading Home双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Heading Home_ 是教主Alan
Walker联手挪威创作歌手Ruben全新单曲。Alan解释道：这首歌是他在创作完《Faded》后创作的第一首歌，对他有很深的意义，时隔多年终于有机会发出了期待！

熟悉的中速迷醉旋律依旧抓耳，迷幻的vocal依然让人浮想联翩。一路走来，坎坷不平，但无限之希望与自由的力量是世界不可腐朽的话题，而音乐就是连接世界的最好途径。Alan
Walker正是用属于他的音乐与他的风格诠释了共和共美的世界复兴。

### Heading Home歌词：

I was so insatiable  
'Til the lights came on and the stories got old  
Now there's no one here I know  
And the city outside it's not the same anymore  
And I I remember when we were young  
We'd write our names in the sand  
So carelessly  
Then the rain came and yours was gone  
And now mine it stays alone  
Nobody sees me now I'm a one man show  
I'll do this on my own  
We knew it all then now this is all I know  
Guess I'm heading home now  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Yeah  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Guess I'm heading home now  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Guess I'm heading home now  
When the music always played  
With the sound of our lives and the sweetest escape  
And the neighbors would complain  
We would turn it up louder who cares anyway  
'Cause we we remember that we were young  
Our lives were grains in the sand  
And we made up castles and kingdoms of  
Now the rains have torn them down  
Nobody sees me now I'm a one man show  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Yeah  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Guess I'm heading home now  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Guess I'm heading home now  
You'll find me  
I'll be here oh  
I can't see  
I can't breathe anymore  
But how could we have stayed  
You were high on love I was drunk  
Drunk on the pain ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Yes I'm heading I'm heading I'm heading  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
I'm heading home now hmm  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Guess I'm heading home now
