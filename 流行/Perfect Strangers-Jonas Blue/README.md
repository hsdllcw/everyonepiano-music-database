### Perfect Strangers歌词：

You were looking at me like you wanted to stay  
你正用眼神凝视着我 如同渴望留下  
When I saw you yesterday  
当我昨天第一次见你的时候  
I'm not wasting your time, I'm not playing no games  
我既不愿浪费你的时间 也不想玩弄你的感情  
I see you  
如今我眼中全是你  
Who knows the secret tomorrow will hold?  
无法预测未来将会怀揣着怎样的秘密  
We don't really need to know  
我们也不必追根寻底  
Cause you're here with me now, I don't want you to go  
因为此刻你就在我的身边 我不想你离开  
You're here with me now, I don't want you to go  
你就在这儿和我一起 我不想你走  
Maybe we're perfect strangers  
也许我们会成为完美的陌生人  
Maybe it's not forever  
也许一切稍纵即逝  
Maybe intellect will change us
