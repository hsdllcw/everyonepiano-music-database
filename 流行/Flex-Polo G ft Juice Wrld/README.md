### Flex歌词：

Polo G：  
Mm-mm-mm mm-mm-mm  
Hit-Boy  
Mm-mm-mm mm-mm-mm  
Natural born hustler n***a stuntin' is my strong suit  
Flexin' with a hundred cash look at what these songs do  
Gangster and a baller baby I do what I want to  
I be with some steppers I don't care 'bout what you gon' do  
Wet s**t like the Warriors all my n***as gon' shoot  
He gon' have to take a loss some my n***as gone too  
I know a bad b***h and I'm who she belong to  
I just picked a Cuban up from Wafi b***h these stones new  
Dolce& Gabbanas on my feet and these my favorite pair  
Got a lot to lose still can't be scared to take it there  
I was in them slums s**t get dreadful like some Haitian hair  
I come from that zoo it's just cobras pigs and apes in there  
1300 block b***h I caught my last cases there  
Ain't no second chances in this s**t so we can't play it fair  
Foenem line s**t like a barber Glock knock off his facial hair  
Caught him lackin' in his whip they tryna find his face in there  
Lil Hop Out he stay on go b***h all he know is green light  
Let off shots with accuracy showed 'em what that beam like  
Posted by that liquor store was sellin' what the fiends like  
Used to wake up in low income now I live a dream life  
Natural born hustler n***a stuntin' is my strong suit  
Flexin' with a hundred cash look at what these songs do  
Gangster and a baller baby I do what I want to  
I be with some steppers I don't care 'bout what you gon' do  
Wet s**t like the Warriors all my n***as gon' shoot  
He gon' have to take a loss some my n***as gone too  
I know a bad b***h and I'm who she belong to  
I just picked a Cuban up from Wafi b***h these stones new  
Juice WRLD：  
Bury me like a pharaoh with this money and my gold too  
Keep a shooter in there try to rob me this the wrong tune  
I hit Johnny Dang and mixed the diamonds with the gold tooth  
The FN sing a song like it's the leader of a soul group  
Don't come 'round here like we friends you know I don't know you  
You know I got demons allow me to show you  
Lately I been on the road  
Yeah  
Show after show  
I know I'm makin' all the opps mad back home  
Been a while since I had to dial from a trap phone  
See you later alligator quite a while crocodile we gone  
Pray to God that my money stay long  
Also prayin' for good aim for when the devil try to go  
Polo G：  
Natural born hustler n***a stuntin' is my strong suit  
Flexin' with a hundred cash look at what these songs do  
Gangster and a baller baby I do what I want to  
I be with some steppers I don't care 'bout what you gon' do  
Wet s**t like the Warriors all my n***as gon' shoot  
He gon' have to take a loss some my n***as gone too  
I know a bad b***h and I'm who she belong to  
I just picked a Cuban up from Wafi b***h these stones new
