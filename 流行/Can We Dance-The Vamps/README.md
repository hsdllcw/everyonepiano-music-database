### Can We Dance歌词：

I talk a lot of shit when I'm drinking, baby,  
I'm known to go a little too fast.  
Don't mind all my friends, I know they're all crazy,  
But they're the only friends that I have.  
I know I don't know you,  
But I'd like to skip the small talk and romance, girl.  
That's all I have to say so, baby, can we dance?  
Here we go again, another drink I'm caving in,  
Stupid words keep falling from my mouth.  
You know that I mean well,  
My hands remember somewhere else.  
Your eyes are doing naughty butterflies  
Oh, oh, one more drink and I should go,  
Oh, oh, maybe she might like me though.  
Oh, oh, I just can't think of what to say,  
Should I go, should I stay?  
Just can't let her slip away.  
I talk a lot of shit when I'm drinking, baby,  
I'm known to go a little too fast.  
Don't mind all my friends, I know they're all crazy,  
But they're the only friends that I have.  
I know I don't know you,  
But I'd like to skip the small talk and romance, girl.  
That's all I have to say so, baby, can we dance?  
I was nearly in, but then came in the pushy friend,  
Killed my vibe and took my perfect ten away.  
You know I need you, girl,  
My heart's not made for someone else.  
Take me in 'cause I can barely stand.  
Oh, oh, one more drink and I should go,  
Oh, oh, maybe she might like me though.  
Oh, oh, I just can't take this any more,  
Should I stay? Should I go?  
It'll just lead back to her door.  
I talk a lot of shit when I'm drinking, baby,  
I'm known to go a little too fast.  
Don't mind all my friends, I know they're all crazy,  
But they're the only friends that I have.  
I know I don't know you,  
But I'd like to skip the small talk and romance, girl.  
That's all I have to say so, baby, can we dance?  
I've been a bad, bad boy  
Whispering rude things in her ear,  
Please say she'll break,  
Please say she'll change  
Her mind and bring me back to her place.  
I talk a lot of shit when I'm drinking, baby,  
I'm known to go a little too fast.  
Don't mind all my friends, I know they're all crazy,  
But they're the only friends that I have.  
I know I don't know you,  
But I'd like to skip the small talk and romance, girl.  
That's all I have to say so, baby, can we dance?
