### Butter歌词：

Smooth like butter  
Like a criminal undercover  
Gon' pop like trouble  
Breakin' into your heart like that  
Ooh  
Cool shade stunner  
Yeah I owe it all to my mother  
Hot like summer  
Yeah I'm makin' you sweat like that  
Break it down  
Oh when I look in the mirror  
I'll melt your heart into two  
I got that superstar glow so  
Ooh  
Do the boogie like  
Side step right left to my beat  
High like the moon rock with me baby  
Know that I got that heat  
Let me show you 'cause talk is cheap  
Side step right left to my beat  
Get it let it roll  
Smooth like butter  
Pull you in like no other  
Don't need no Usher  
To remind me you got it bad  
Ain't no other  
That can sweep you up like a robber  
Straight up I got ya  
Makin' you fall like that  
Break it down  
Oh when I look in the mirror  
I'll melt your heart into two  
I got that superstar glow so  
Ooh  
Do the boogie like  
Side step right left to my beat  
High like the moon rock with me baby  
Know that I got that heat  
Let me show you 'cause talk is cheap  
Side step right left to my beat  
Get it let it roll  
Get it let it roll  
Get it let it roll  
Ice on my wrist I'm the nice guy  
Got the right body and the right mind  
Rollin' up to party got the right vibe  
Smooth like  
Butter  
Hate us  
Love us  
Fresh boy pull up and we lay low  
All the playas get movin' when the bass low  
Got ARMY right behind us when we say so  
Let's go  
Side step right left to my beat  
Right left to my beat  
High like the moon rock with me baby  
Know that I got that heat  
Let me show you 'cause talk is cheap  
You know that talk is cheap  
Side step right left to my beat  
Get it let it roll  
Smooth like  
Butter  
Cool shade  
Stunner  
And you know we don't stop  
Hot like  
Summer  
Ain't no  
Bummer  
You be like oh my God  
We gon' make you rock and you say  
Yeah  
We gon' make you bounce and you say  
Yeah  
Hotter sweeter cooler butter  
Get it let it roll
