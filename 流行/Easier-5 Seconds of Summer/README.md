### Easier歌词：

Is it easier to stay Is it easier to go  
I don't wanna know oh  
But I know that I'm never ever gonna change  
And you know you don't want it any other way  
Why do we always gotta run away  
And we wind up in the same place  
It's like we're looking for the same thing  
Same thing yeah  
Yeah do we really gotta do this now  
Right here with all your friends around  
In the morning we can work it out  
Work it out  
I love you so much that I hate you  
Right now it's so hard to blame you  
'Cause you're so damn beautiful  
You're so damn beautiful  
Is it easier to stay Is it easier to go  
I don't wanna know oh  
But I know that I'm never ever gonna change  
And you know that you're always gonna stay the same  
Is it easier to stay Is it easier to go  
I don't wanna know oh  
But I know that I'm never ever gonna change  
And you know you don't want it any other way  
Every time that you say you're gonna leave  
That's when you get the very best of me  
You know we need it like the air we breathe  
Air we breathe yeah  
I love you so much that I hate you  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
Right now it's so hard to blame you Oh  
'Cause you're so damn beautiful Oh  
You're so damn beautiful Oh-oh oh-oh  
Is it easier to stay Is it easier to go  
I don't wanna know oh  
But I know that I'm never ever gonna change  
And you know that you're always gonna stay the same  
Is it easier to stay Is it easier to go  
I don't wanna know oh I don't wanna know  
But I know that I'm never ever gonna change  
And you know you don't want it any other way  
The hardest part of all  
Da-da-da-dum-da-da  
Is that we're only built to fall  
Is it any easier  
Is it easier to stay Is it easier to go  
I don't wanna know oh Oh-oh  
But I know that I'm never ever gonna change  
And you know that you're always gonna stay the same Is it easier  
Is it easier to stay Is it easier to go Yeah  
I don't wanna know oh Oh  
But I know that I'm never ever gonna change  
And you know you don't want it any other way  
I love you so much that I hate you  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
Right now it's so hard to blame you  
'Cause you're so damn beautiful
