**Friends双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Friends_ 是Justin Bieber与美国顶级制作人BloodPop合作的最新单曲。Justin
Bieber可以说是“出名要趁早”的典范。用“狂热”两个字可能已不足以形容他在流行乐坛掀起的潮流。他在面对如此多的名利诱惑时却表现得谨慎而冷静，表示不想做昙花一现的“流星”，而是能在乐坛真正立足。

除BloodPop外，全新单曲《Friends》更有金曲制作人Julia Michaels、Justin
Tranter联合创作。继《Despacito》之后，Bieber又一首值得无限循环的热单，Friends请收下！

### Friends歌词：

[Intro]  
BloodPop  
[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]  
I was wonderin' 'bout your mama  
Did she get that job she wanted?  
Sell that car that gave her problems?  
I'm just curious 'bout her, honest  
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]  
Know you're wonderin' why I been callin'?  
Like I got ulterior motives  
I know we didn't end this so good  
But you know we had something so good  
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]  
So I'm wondering, can we still be friends? (ah-ah)  
Can we still be friends? (ah-ah)  
Doesn't have to end (ah-ah)  
And if it ends, can we be friends?  
Can we be friends?  
Can we be friends?  
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]  
Wonderin' if you got a body  
To hold you tighter since I left  
Wonderin' if you think about me  
Actually, don't answer that  
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]  
Know you're wonderin' why I been callin'?  
Like I got ulterior motives  
I know we didn't end this so good  
But you know we had something so good  
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]  
So I'm wondering, can we still be friends? (ah-ah)  
Can we still be friends? (ah-ah)  
Doesn't have to end (ah-ah)  
And if it ends, can we be friends?  
Can we be friends?  
Can we be friends?  
And if it ends, can we be friends?  
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]  
Know you're wonderin' why I been callin'?  
Like I got ulterior motives  
I know we didn't end this so good  
But you know we had something so good  
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]  
I'm wondering, can we still be friends? (ah-ah)  
Can we still be friends? (ah-ah)  
Doesn't have to end (ah-ah)  
And if it ends, can we be friends?
