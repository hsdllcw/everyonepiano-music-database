### There For You歌词：

I woke up pissed off today,  
And lately everyone feels fake  
Somewhere, I lost a piece of me  
Smoking cigarettes on balconies  
But I can't do this alone  
Sometimes I just need a light  
If I call you on the phone  
Need you on the other side  
So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river  
I'll be there for you  
I'll be there for you  
When you're screaming, but they only hear you whisper  
I'll be loud for you  
But you gotta be there for me too  
But you gotta be there for me too  
Last year took a toll on me  
But I made it with you next to me  
Around the world and back again  
I hope you waited at the end  
But I can't do this alone  
Sometimes I just need a light  
If I call you on the phone  
Need you on the other side  
So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river  
I'll be there for you  
I'll be there for you  
When you're screaming, but they only hear you whisper  
I'll be loud for you  
I'll be loud for you  
I got you, I promise  
Let me be honest  
Love is a road that goes both ways  
When your tears roll down your pillow like a river  
I'll be there for you  
But you gotta be there for me too  
But you gotta be there for me too  
But I'm holding on to something  
Won't let go of you for nothing  
I'm running, running just to keep my hands on you  
There was a time that I was so blue  
What I got to do to show you?  
I'm running, running just to keep my hands on you  
Running, running just to keep my hands on you  
Running, running just to keep my hands on you  
So, I'm running, running just to keep my hands on you  
But you gotta be there for me too  
But you gotta be there for me too
