**Happiness** 是Taylor Swift第九张个人专辑《Evermore》收录的十七首歌曲之一。

她的音乐总是拥有治愈人心的能量。此曲唱入了心扉，看歌名以为是讲幸福快乐的事，实际上歌内容是一段悲伤的故事。一段原本完美长久的感情出现了问题，最终破裂的伤心故事，Taylor把这首歌创作的太好了，词曲都很精美。

### Happiness歌词：

Honey when I'm above the trees  
I see this for what it is  
But now I'm right down in it all the years I've given  
Is just s**t we're dividing up  
Showed you all of my hiding spots  
I was dancing when the music stopped  
And in the disbelief I can't face reinvention  
I haven't met the new me yet  
There'll be happiness after you  
But there was happiness because of you  
Both of these things can be true  
There is happiness  
Past the blood and bruise  
Past the curses and cries  
Beyond the terror in the nightfall  
Haunted by the look in my eyes  
That would've loved you for a lifetime  
Leave it all behind  
And there is happiness  
Tell me when did your winning smile  
Begin to look like a smirk  
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons  
Pointed at my deepest hurt  
I hope she'll be a beautiful fool  
Who takes my spot next to you  
No I didn't mean that  
Sorry I can't see facts through all of my fury  
You haven't met the new me yet  
There'll be happiness after me  
But there was happiness because of me  
Both of these things I believe  
There is happiness  
In our history across our great divide  
There is a glorious sunrise  
Dappled with the flickers of light  
From the dress I wore at midnight leave it all behind  
And there is happiness  
I can't make it go away by making you a villain  
I guess it's the price I pay for seven years in heaven  
And I pulled your body into mine  
Every godd**n night now I get fake niceties  
No one teaches you what to do  
When a good man hurts you  
And you know you hurt him too  
Honey when I'm above the trees  
I see it for what it is  
But now my eyes leak acid rain  
On the pillow where you used to lay your head  
After giving you the best I had  
Tell me what to give after that  
All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness  
You haven't met the new me yet  
And I think she'll give you that  
There'll be happiness after you  
But there was happiness because of you too  
Both of these things can be true  
There is happiness  
In our history across our great divide  
There is a glorious sunrise  
Dappled with the flickers of light  
From the dress I wore at midnight leave it all behind  
Oh leave it all behind  
Leave it all behind  
And there is happiness
