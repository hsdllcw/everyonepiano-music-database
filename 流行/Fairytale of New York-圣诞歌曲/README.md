### Fairytale of New York歌词：

It was Christmas Eve babe  
In the drunk tank  
An old man said to me  
Won't see another one  
And then he sang a song  
The Rare Old Mountain Dew  
I turned my face away  
And dreamed about you  
Got on a lucky one  
Came in eighteen-to-one  
I've got a feeling  
This year's for me and you  
So Happy Christmas  
I love you baby  
I can see a better time  
When all our dreams come true  
They've got cars big as bars  
They've got rivers of gold  
But the wind goes right through you  
It's no place for the old  
When you first took my hand  
On a cold Christmas Eve  
You promised me Broadway was waiting for me  
You were handsome  
You were pretty Queen of New York City  
When the band finished playing  
They howled out for more  
Sinatra was swinging  
All the drunks they were singing  
We kissed on a corner  
Then danced through the night  
The boys of the NYPD choir  
Were singing Galway Bay  
And the bells were ringing out  
For Christmas day  
You're a bum you're a punk  
You're an old slut on junk  
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed  
You scumbag you maggot  
You cheap lousy faggot  
Happy Christmas your arse  
I pray God it's our last  
The boys of the NYPD choir  
Still singing Galway Bay  
And the bells are ringing out  
For Christmas day  
I could have been someone  
Well so could anyone  
You took my dreams from me  
When I first found you  
I kept them with me babe  
I put them with my own  
Can't make it all alone  
I've built my dreams around you  
The boys of the NYPD choir  
Still singing Galway Bay  
And the bells are ringing out  
For Christmas day
