### Wrong Direction歌词：

I don't hate you  
No I couldn't if I wanted to  
I just hate all the hurt that you put me through  
And that I blame myself for letting you  
Did you know I already knew  
Couldn't even see you through the smoke  
Lookin' back I probably should have known  
But I just wanted to believe that you were out sleepin' alone  
Loved me with your worst intentions  
Didn't even stop to question  
Every time you burned me down  
Don't know how for a moment it felt like heaven  
Loved me with your worst intentions  
Painted us a happy ending  
Every time you burned me down  
Don't know how for a moment it felt like heaven  
And it's so gut-wrenchin'  
Fallin' in the wrong direction  
On my tip-toes  
But I still couldn't reach your ego  
Guess I was crazy to give you my body my mind  
Don't know what I was thinkin' 'til now  
Everyone thinks that you're somebody else  
You even convinced yourself  
Couldn't even see you through the smoke  
Lookin' back I probably should have known  
But I just wanted to believe that you were out sleepin' alone  
Loved me with your worst intentions  
Didn't even stop to question  
Every time you burned me down  
Don't know how for a moment it felt like heaven  
Loved me with your worst intentions  
Painted us a happy ending  
Every time you burned me down  
Don't know how for a moment it felt like heaven  
And it's so gut-wrenchin'  
Ooh ooh  
Fallin' in the wrong direction  
Ooh ooh  
How did you sweep me right off my feet  
Baby I can't keep  
Fallin' in the wrong direction  
How did you sweep me right off my feet  
Right off my feet  
Couldn't even see you through the smoke  
Lookin' back I probably should have known  
But I just wanted to believe that you were out sleepin' alone  
Loved me with your worst intentions  
Didn't even stop to question  
No  
Every time you burned me down  
Me down  
Don't know how for a moment it felt like heaven  
Loved me with your worst intentions  
Painted us a happy ending  
Ooh  
Every time you burned me down  
Me down  
Don't know how for a moment it felt like heaven  
And it's so gut-wrenchin'  
Fallin' in the wrong direction
