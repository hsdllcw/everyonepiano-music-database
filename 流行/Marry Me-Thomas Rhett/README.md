### Marry Me歌词：

She wants to get married she wants it perfect  
She wants her grandaddy preaching the service  
Yeah she wants magnolias out in the country  
Not too many people save her daddy some money  
Ooh she got it all planned out  
Yeah I can see it all right now  
I'll wear my black suit black tie hide out in the back  
I'll do a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask  
I'll try to make it through without crying so nobody sees  
Yeah she wanna get married  
But she don't wanna marry me  
I remember the night when I almost kissed her  
Yeah I kinda freaked out we'd been friends forever  
And I always wondered if she felt the same way  
When I got the invite I knew it was too late  
Oh her daddy's been dreading this day  
Oh but he don't know he ain't the only one giving her away  
I'll wear my black suit black tie hide out in the back  
I'll do a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask  
I'll try to make it through without crying so nobody sees  
Yeah she wanna get married  
But she don't wanna marry me  
She got on her dress now welcoming the guests now  
I could try to find her get it off of my chest now  
But I ain't gonna mess it up so I'll wish her the best now  
So I'm in my black suit black tie hiding out in the back  
Doing a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask  
I'll try to make it through without crying so nobody sees  
Yeah she wanna get married  
Yeah she gonna get married  
But she ain't gonna marry me  
Whoa but she ain't gonna marry me no
