All of the Stars歌词：

It's just another night and I'm staring at the moon  
I saw a shooting star and thought of you  
I sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew  
If you were here, I'd sing to you

You're on the other side  
As the skyline splits in two  
Miles away from seeing you

But I can see the stars from America  
I wonder, do you see them too?

So open your eyes and see  
The way our horizons meet  
And all of the lights will lead  
Into the night with me  
And I know these scars will bleed  
But both of our hearts believe  
All of these stars will guide us home

I can hear your heart on the radio beat  
They're playing "Chasing Cars" and I thought of us  
Back to the time you were lying next to me  
I looked across and fell in love

So I took your hand  
Back through lamp-lit streets and dew  
Everything led back to you

So can you see the stars over Amsterdam?  
Hear the song my heart is beating to

So open your eyes and see  
The way our horizons meet  
And all of the lights will leave  
Into the night with me  
And I know these scars will bleed  
But both of our hearts believe  
All of these stars will guide us home

And oh  
And oh  
And oh whoa  
I can see the stars from America
