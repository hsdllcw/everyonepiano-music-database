**Shotgun** 是英伦创作才子George
Ezra的歌曲。此曲连续两周登上英国UK单曲榜榜首，这也是他收获的个人第一首冠单。在音乐上，Ezra受Bob Dylan和Woody
Guthrie的影响，他的声音曾被评为布鲁斯乐的年度之声。浑厚磁性的嗓音，&ldquo;鲜肉&rdquo;外表和&ldquo;邻家大男孩&rdquo;的气质，这种反差萌也成功撩到了一大波粉丝。

他的全新专辑《Staying at Tamara's》已于三月正式发行，口碑获得了各大音乐媒体的认可。而专辑中的这首《 _Shotgun_
》旋律轻快俏皮，歌词版MV也走有爱的路线，网友表示这是标准的“男友脸”啊，听他唱歌嘴角不知不觉就上扬~

### Shotgun歌词：

Home grown alligator see you later  
Gotta hit the road gotta hit the road  
Something changed in the atmosphere  
Architecture unfamiliar  
I could get used to this  
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun  
Feeling like I'm someone  
Time flies by in the yellow and green  
Stick around and you'll see what I mean  
There's a mountaintop that I'm dreaming of  
If you need me you know where I'll be  
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun  
Feeling like I'm someone  
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun  
Feeling like I'm someone  
The South of the Equator navigator  
Gotta hit the road gotta hit the road  
Deep sea diving round the clock bikini bottoms Lager tops  
I could get used to this  
Time flies by in the yellow and green  
Stick around and you'll see what I mean  
There's a mountaintop that I'm dreaming of  
If you need me you know where I'll be  
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun  
Feeling like I'm someone  
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun  
Feeling like I'm someone  
We got two in the front  
Two in the back  
Sailing along  
And we don't look back back back back back  
Time flies by in the yellow and green  
Stick around and you'll see what I mean  
There's a mountaintop that I'm dreaming of  
If you need me you know where I'll be  
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun  
Feeling like I'm someone  
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun  
Feeling like I'm someone  
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun  
Feeling like I'm someone  
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun  
Feeling like I'm someone  
I'm someone  
I'm someone  
I'm someone
