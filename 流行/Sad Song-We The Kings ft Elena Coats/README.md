### Sad Song歌词：

You and I  
We're like fireworks and symphonies exploding in the sky  
With you I'm alive  
Like all the missing pieces of my heart they finally collide  
So stop time right here in the moonlight  
Cause I don't ever wanna close my eyes  
Without you I feel broke  
Like I'm half of a whole  
Without you I've got no hand to hold  
Without you I feel torn  
Like a sail in a storm  
Without you I'm just a sad song  
I'm just a sad song  
With you I fall  
It's like I'm leaving all my past in silhouettes up on the wall  
With you I'm a beautiful mess  
It's like we're standing hand in hand with all our fears up on the edge  
So stop time right here in the moonlight  
Cause I don't ever wanna close my eyes  
Without you I feel broke  
Like I'm half of a whole  
Without you I've got no hand to hold  
Without you I feel torn  
Like a sail in a storm  
Without you I'm just a sad song  
You're the perfect melody  
The only harmony I wanna to hear  
You're my favorite part of me  
With you standing next to me  
I've got nothing to fear  
Without you I feel broke  
Like I'm half of a whole  
Without you I've got no hand to hold  
Without you I feel torn  
Like a sail in a storm  
Without you  
Without you I feel broke  
Like I'm half of a whole  
Without you I've got no hand to hold  
Without you I feel torn  
Like a sail in a storm  
Without you I'm just a sad song  
I'm just a sad song
