**POV** 是由美国女歌手Ariana
Grande录唱的一首歌曲，收录在其于2020年10月30日发行的第六张录音室专辑《Positions》中。整首歌非常温柔，加上Ariana迷人的嗓音，十分抓耳！

歌曲的结尾是宁静的，是深邃的，是如泉水般清澈的。它不是忧伤的，就像Ariana说的，她挺过去了。留下的是那甜如蜜糖的美梦，让人不想醒来。在专辑前面的任何火热，任何激动，此刻都融化在一起，只不过在这里所有颜色融合在一起不再是忧伤的黑色。而是淡雅的白色。

### POV歌词：

It's like you got superpowers  
Turn my minutes into hours  
You got more than 20/20 babe  
Made of glass the way you see through me  
You know me better than I do  
Can't seem to keep nothing from you  
How you touch my soul from the outside  
Permeate my ego and my pride  
I wanna love me  
Ooh  
The way that you love me  
Ooh  
Ooh for all of my pretty  
And all of my ugly too  
I'd love to see me from your point of view  
I wanna trust me  
Trust me  
The way that you trust me  
Trust me  
Ooh 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do  
I'd love to see me from your point of view  
I'm getting used to receiving  
Still getting good at not leaving  
I'ma love you even though I'm scared  
Oh scared  
Learnin' to be grateful for myself  
Oh oh oh  
You love my lips 'cause they say the  
Things we've always been afraid of  
I can feel it startin' to subside  
Learnin' to believe in what is mine  
I wanna love me  
Ooh  
The way that you love me  
Ooh  
Ooh for all of my pretty  
And all of my ugly too  
I'd love to see me from your point of view  
I wanna trust me  
Trust me  
The way that you trust me  
Trust me  
Ooh 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do  
I'd love to see me from your point of view  
I couldn't believe it or see it for myself  
Boy I be impatient but now I'm out here  
Fallin' fallin' frozen slowly  
Fallin' got me right  
I won't keep you waitin'  
Waitin'  
All my baggage fadin' safely  
My baggage fadin'  
And if my eyes deceive me  
Won't let them stray too far away  
I wanna love me  
Ooh  
The way that you love me  
Ooh  
Ooh for all of my pretty  
And all of my ugly too  
I'd love to see me from your point of view  
I wanna trust me ooh  
Trust me  
The way that you trust me baby  
Trust me  
'Cause nobody ever loved me like you do  
I'd love to see me from your point of view  
Oh  
Yeah
