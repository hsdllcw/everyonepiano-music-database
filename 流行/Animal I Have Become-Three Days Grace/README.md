Three Days
Grace，简称TDG，3DG，中文译为为“三天的宽限”或“宽限三天”，是一支来自加拿大的另类金属乐队。乐队前身是Groundswell，早在1992年就已经成立，1995年解散，然而又在1997年重组，活跃至今。  
  
_Animal I Have Become_ 他们专辑《One-X》的主打曲目，是Gontier在逐渐冷静下来的时候所写另外还包括“Over and
Over”，“Gone Forever”，“Pain”和“Never
tooLate”。Gontier在2006年的一次采访中谈到：比起乐队以前的作品，这张专辑更多的是个人的东西，因为灵感来自于他自己的经历，悲观沮丧，药物滥用，还有治疗，这些构成了他这两年的生活。新专辑《One-X》在2006年6月13日发行，这是吉他手Barry
Stock首次参与录制。

### Animal I Have Become歌词：

I can't escape this hell  
So many times I've tried  
But I'm still caged inside  
Somebody get me through this nightmare  
I can't control myself

So what if you can see the darkest side of me?  
No one will ever change this animal I have become  
Help me believe it's not the real me  
Somebody help me tame this animal  
(This animal, this animal)

I can't escape myself  
(I can't escape myself)  
So many times I've lied  
(So many times I've lied)  
But there's still rage inside  
Somebody get me through this nightmare  
I can't control myself

So what if you can see the darkest side of me?  
No one will ever change this animal I have become  
Help me believe it's not the real me  
Somebody help me tame this animal I have become  
Help me believe it's not the real me  
Somebody help me tame this animal

Somebody help me through this nightmare  
I can't control myself  
Somebody wake me from this nightmare  
I can't escape this hell

(This animal, this animal, this animal, this animal, this animal, this animal,
this animal)

So what if you can see the darkest side of me?  
No one will ever change this animal I have become  
Help me believe it's not the real me  
Somebody help me tame this animal I have become  
Help me believe it's not the real me  
Somebody help me tame this animal  
(This animal I have become)
