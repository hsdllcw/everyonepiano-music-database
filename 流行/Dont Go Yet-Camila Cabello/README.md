古巴女神Camila Cabello，时隔两年狂野回归，回归单曲《 **Don't Go Yet**
》于2021年7月23日发行。歌曲融合古巴与墨西哥音乐元素，火热与动感燃情释放！同时，此曲也将收录在其即将发行的第三张录音室专辑《Familia》中。

2019的夏天，她与Shawn Mendes合作的单曲《[ **Señorita**](Music-10525-Señorita-Shawn-
Mendes和Camila-Cabello.html
"Señorita")》发行后再次爆火，随后二人恋情公布，广受大家祝福。然而二专发行不久，铺天盖地的中伤和粗语都集中在Camila身上，许多人落井下石，更有甚者不分事实抹黑，让人们将好专《Romance》抛之脑后，成为意难平。

现如今，三专首单《 _Don't Go Yet_ 》发行，重现异域风情，同样也将上映电影灰姑娘，这是要音乐、影业。爱情三丰收的节奏啊！

### Don't Go Yet歌词：

Oh my love oh yeah yeah  
I'm in love yeah  
I'll replay this moment for months  
Alone in my head waitin' for it to come  
I wrote all your lines and the script's in my mind and  
I hope that you follow it for once  
I imagine myself in satin the room was platinum and gold  
I dance and catch your eye you'll be mesmerized oh  
We find a corner then your hands in my hair  
Finally we're here so I  
Sayin' you got a flight need an early night no  
Don't go yet  
Oh yeah don't go yet don't go yet  
Oh yeah don't go yet don't go yet  
Oh yeah don't go yet don't go yet  
What you leavin' for when my night is yours  
Just a little morе don't go yet  
Baby don't go yet 'cause I worе this dress for a lil' drama  
In a bed I bet that you think that you know but you don't  
Baby come to mama

And I get it how I wanna wanna  
And I want you baby gotta get you baby  
We find a corner then your hands in my hair
