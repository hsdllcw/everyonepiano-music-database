### Find You歌词：

Silent love is calling faith  
To shatter me through your hallways  
Into echoes you can feel  
And rehearse the way you heal

Make them dance  
Just like you  
Cause you make me move  
Yeah you always make me go

I'll run away with your foot steps  
I'll build a city that dreams for two  
And if you lose yourself  
I will find you

High on words  
We almost used  
We're fireworks with a wet fuse  
Flying planes with paper wheels  
To the same Achilles heels

Make them dance  
Just like you  
Cause you make me move  
Yeah you always make me go

I'll run away with your foot steps  
I'll build a city that dreams for two  
And if you lose yourself  
I will find you

(yeah you always make me go)

Open up your skies  
Turn up your night  
To the speed of life  
Turn up your night  
Put your love in lights  
Turn up your night  
I will find you

Make them dance  
Just like you  
Cause you make me move  
Yeah you always make me go

(yeah you always make me go)

I'll run away with your foot steps  
I'll build a city that dreams for two  
And if you lose yourself  
I will find you

(yeah you always make me go go go go go)  
Turn up your night  
(go go go go)  
Turn up your night  
(go go go go turn it up turn it up)  
Turn up your night  
I will find you

Make them dance  
Just like you  
Cause you make me move  
Yeah you always make me go
