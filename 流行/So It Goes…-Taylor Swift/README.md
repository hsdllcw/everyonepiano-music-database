**So It Goes…双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_So It Goes…_ 是美国创作型女歌手Taylor
Swift演唱的一首歌曲。收录于2017年11月10日发行的第6张录音室专辑《Reputation》中。

此曲不是快歌，很放松，真的是我第一遍就喜欢上的歌，它给小编一种从辽远空旷的悬崖纵身一跃然后支离破碎，漫天纷飞或者是在氤氲水中沉浮，挣扎，绽放，升华的感觉。

### So It Goes…歌词：

See you in the dark  
All eyes on you my magician  
All eyes on us  
You make everyone disappear and  
Cut me into pieces  
Gold cage hostage to my feelings  
Back against the wall  
Trippin' trip-trippin' when you're gone  
'Cause we break down a little  
But when you get me alone it's so simple  
'Cause baby I know what you know  
We can feel it  
And all our pieces fall  
Right into place  
Get caught up in the moments  
Lipstick on your face  
So it goes  
I'm yours to keep  
And I'm yours to lose  
You know I'm not a bad girl but I  
Do bad things with you  
So it goes  
Met you in a bar  
All eyes on me your illusionist  
All eyes on us  
I make all your grey days clear and  
Wear you like a necklace  
I'm so chill but you make me jealous  
But I got your heart  
Skippin' skip-skippin' when I'm gone  
'Cause we break down a little  
But when I get you alone it's so simple  
'Cause baby I know what you know  
We can feel it  
And all our pieces fall  
Right into place  
Get caught up in the moments  
Lipstick on your face  
So it goes  
I'm yours to keep  
And I'm yours to lose  
You know I'm not a bad girl but I  
Do bad things with you  
So it goes  
Come here dressed in black now  
So so so it goes  
Scratches down your back now  
So so so it goes  
You did a number on me  
But honestly baby who's counting  
I did a number on you  
But honestly baby who's counting  
You did a number on me  
But honestly baby who's counting  
Who's counting  
1 2 3  
And all our pieces fall pieces fall  
Right into place  
Get caught up in the moments caught up caught up  
Lipstick on your face  
So it goes goes  
I'm yours to keep oh  
And I'm yours to lose baby  
You know I'm not a bad girl but I  
Do bad things with you  
So it goes  
Come here dressed in black now  
So so so it goes  
Scratches down your back now  
So so so it goes  
Come here dressed in black now  
So so so it goes  
Scratches down your back now  
So so so it goes
