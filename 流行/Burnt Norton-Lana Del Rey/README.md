**Burnt Norton双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Burnt Norton_ 是Lana Del Rey的歌曲，收录在其专辑Honeymoon中。其实此曲来源于一首诗歌，名字也为Burnt
Norton，中文译为《烧毁的诺顿》。《烧毁的诺顿》是诺贝尔奖获得者艾略特晚期代表作的《四个四重奏》其中的一首。《四个四重奏》四首分别是对现在、过去、未来及时间整体的救赎问题的思想与体悟，《燃毁的诺顿》则集中于“时间现在”。《燃毁的诺顿》指一座英国乡间住宅的玫瑰园遗址。

### Burnt Norton歌词：

Time present and time past  
Are both perhaps present in time future  
And time future contained in time past  
If all time is eternally present  
All time is unredeemable  
What might have been is an abstraction  
Remaining a perpetual possibility  
Only in a world of speculation  
What might have been and what has been  
Point to one end, which is always present  
Footfalls echo in the memory  
Down the passage which we did not take  
Towards the door we never opened  
Into the rose-garden
