### Anyone for You (Tiger Lily)歌词：

Tiger lily moved to the city  
She just turned twenty-one  
And then I said "Here's my number hit me up  
If you're needing anyone"  
And I could be anyone anyone anyone anyone anyone for you  
Anyone anyone anyone anyone anyone  
I could love you I could be  
Anything you want of me  
And in the darkness of the night  
Baby let me be your light  
I could love you I could be  
Anything you want of me  
And in the darkness of the night  
Baby let me be your light  
Be your light  
Be your light  
Yeah  
Well it came along but it wasn't enough  
So she called me up just to call it off  
I can't afford to make that mistake this time  
And if you're flying over the Serengeti  
Tiger lily don't forget me  
The way I am or the way I was mmm  
And I could be anyone anyone anyone anyone anyone for you  
Anyone anyone anyone anyone anyone  
I could love you I could be  
Anything you want of me  
And in the darkness of the night  
Baby let me be your light  
I could love you I could be  
Anything you want of me  
And in the darkness of the night  
Baby let me be your light  
Be your light  
Be your light  
Light light light  
Anyone for you  
I could love you I could be  
Anything you want of me  
And in the darkness of the night  
Baby let me be your light  
I could love you I could be  
Anything you want of me  
And in the darkness of the night  
Baby let me be your light  
I could love you I could be  
Anything you want of me  
And in the darkness of the night  
Baby let me be your light  
I could love you I could be  
Anything you want of me  
And in the darkness of the night  
Baby let me be your light  
Be your light  
Woo  
Be your light  
Woo  
Oh  
I can be your light
