### Her Bright Smile Haunts Me Still歌词：

'Tis years since last we met, and we may not meet again;  
I have draggled to forget, but that struggle was in vain-  
For her voice lives on the breeze, and her spirit comes at w I'll;  
In the midnight, on the seas. her bright smile haunts me still.  
For her voice lives on the breeze, and her spirit comes at will;  
In the midnight, on the seas, her bright smile haunts me still.

At the first sweet dawn of light, when I gaze upon the deep.  
Her form still greets my sight, while the stars their vigils keep.  
When I close mine aching eyes, sweet dreams my senses till;  
And from sleep a hen I arise her bright smile haunts me still.  
When I close mine aching eyes sweet dreams my senses fill;  
And from sleep when I arise her bright smile haunts me still.

I have sailed 'neath alien skies, I have trod the desert path;  
I have seen the storm arise like a giant in his wrath;  
Every danger I have known that a reckless life can fill;  
Yet her presence is not flown, her bright smile haunts me still.  
Every danger I have known that a reckless lift can fill;  
Yet her presence is not flown, her bright smile haunts me still.
