### Love Not War (The Tampa Beat)歌词：

Jason derulo  
Yeah  
Oh oh  
Ooh  
Bust it open for a gift  
I put diamonds on your wrist  
I can't buy your lovin'  
It's never enough  
I took that girl on a trip  
'Cause we was arguin'  
Ever since we stopped touchin'  
We're not in touch  
I know money can't buy buy buy your love  
I guess I didn't try try try hard enough  
But we could work this like a nine to five  
Oh oh  
Mama told me stop playin' playin' all the games  
Steady throwin' dollars expectin' change  
But every war ends the same  
Can we just make love not war  
Oh oh  
Can we just make love not war  
I solve my problems with a check  
Now I'm payin' for it  
You wanted nothin' uh  
Nothin' but love  
I can't lie I'm a mess  
I'm too jealous yes  
So hard to trust you  
When I don't trust myself  
I know money can't buy buy buy your love  
I guess I didn't try try try hard enough  
But we could work this like a nine to five  
Oh oh  
Mama told me stop playin' playin' all the games  
Steady throwin' dollars expectin' change  
But every war ends the same  
Can we just make love not war  
Oh oh  
Can we just make love not war  
Oh oh  
And my people say  
Oh oh  
Let's just trust in lovin' baby  
But shawty I know  
I know money can't buy buy buy your love  
I guess I didn't try try try hard enough  
Call we could work this like a nine to five five five  
Oh oh baby  
Mama told me stop playin' playin' all the games  
Stop playin' the games  
Steady throwin' dollars expectin' change  
But every war ends the same  
Can we just make love and not war  
Oh oh baby  
Can we just make love not war  
Oh oh  
Not war baby
