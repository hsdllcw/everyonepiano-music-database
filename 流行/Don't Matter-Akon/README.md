### Don’t Matter歌词：

Konvict, Konvict, Konvict  
Nobody wanna see us together  
But it don't matter, no  
('Cause I got you babe)  
Nobody wanna see us together  
But it don't matter, no  
('Cause I got you babe)  
'Cause we gon' fight  
Oh yes, we gon' fight  
(We gon' fight)  
Believe we gon' fight  
(We gon' fight)  
Fight for our right to love, yeah  
(Right to love, yeah)  
Nobody wanna see us together  
But it don't matter, no  
'Cause I got you  
Nobody wanna see us together, nobody thought we'd last forever  
I feel I'm hopin' and prayin' things between us gon' get better  
Men steady comin' after you, women steady comin' after me  
Seems like e'rybody wanna go for self and don't wanna respect boundary  
Tellin' you all those lies just to get on your side  
But I must admit there was a couple secrets I held inside  
But just know that I tried to always apologize  
And I'ma have you first always in my heart to keep you satisfied  
Nobody wanna see us together  
But it don't matter, no  
('Cause I got you babe)  
Nobody wanna see us together  
But it don't matter, no  
('Cause I got you babe)  
'Cause we gon' fight  
Oh yes, we gon' fight  
(We gon' fight)  
Believe we gon' fight  
(We gon' fight)  
Fight for our right to love, yeah  
(Right to love, yeah)  
Nobody wanna see us together  
But it don't matter, no  
'Cause I got you  
Got every right to wanna leave, you got every right to wanna go  
You got every right to hit the road and never talk to me no more  
You don't even have to call, even check for me at all  
Because the way I been actin' lately has been off the wall  
Especially towards you, puttin' girls before you  
And they watchin' everything I been doin' just to hurt you  
Most of it just ain't true and they won't show you  
How much of a queen you are to me and why I love you baby  
Nobody wanna see us together  
But it don't matter, no  
('Cause I got you babe)  
Nobody wanna see us together  
But it don't matter, no  
('Cause I got you babe)  
'Cause we gon' fight  
Oh yes, we gon' fight  
(We gon' fight)  
Believe we gon' fight  
(We gon' fight)  
Fight for our right to love, yeah  
(Right to love, yeah)  
Nobody wanna see us together  
But it don't matter, no  
'Cause I got you babe  
'Cause I got you babe  
'Cause I got you babe  
'Cause I got you babe  
'Cause I got you babe  
Nobody wanna see us together  
But it don't matter, no  
('Cause I got you babe)  
Nobody wanna see us together  
But it don't matter, no  
('Cause I got you babe)  
'Cause we gon' fight  
Oh yes, we gon' fight  
(We gon' fight)  
Believe we gon' fight  
(We gon' fight)  
Fight for our right to love, yeah  
(Right to love, yeah)  
Nobody wanna see us together  
But it don't matter, no  
'Cause I got you babe  
Nobody wanna see us together  
But it don't matter, no  
('Cause I got you babe)  
Nobody wanna see us together  
But it don't matter, no  
('Cause I got you babe)  
'Cause we gon' fight  
Oh yes, we gon' fight  
(We gon' fight)  
Believe we gon' fight  
(We gon' fight)  
Fight for our right to love, yeah  
(Right to love, yeah)  
Nobody wanna see us together  
But it don't matter, no  
'Cause I got you, babe  
'Cause I got you, babe
