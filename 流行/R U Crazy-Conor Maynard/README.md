### R U Crazy歌词：

No no no no no no no no no no [4x]

Are you crazy?  
Are you crazy?  
Are you crazy?  
Are you crazy?  
Must be stupid if you think that we can start again  
Are you joking? Must be joking  
You ain't laughin', I ain't smokin'  
Must be crazy if you think that we can start again

Yeah, ain't no need to cry no more  
When you break my heart into twenty four  
I'll pick up the pieces you left  
If you think I'm coming back,  
Don't hold your breath

I ain't your mister, no  
'Cause I'm breakin' up with ya  
Shoulda hooked up with your sister  
Go now, here's my middle finger

'Cause I'm hurting, baby, hurting, baby  
Look what you did

Are you crazy?  
Are you crazy?  
Are you crazy?  
Are you crazy?  
Must be stupid if you think that we can start again  
Are you joking? Must be joking  
You ain't laughin', I ain't smokin'  
Must be crazy if you think that we can start again

Yeah, I'm with my boys hit the town  
Let's go see what kind of chick knocks me out  
Now I know that she wants me back  
Nothing sounds more better than "Hit the road, Jack" (Jack)

Don't call me mister,  
Girl, I've broken up with ya  
Love me now, my name is bigger  
Girl, I'm giving you the finger

'Cause I'm hurting, baby, hurting, baby  
Look what you did

Are you crazy?  
Are you crazy?  
Are you crazy?  
Are you crazy?  
Must be stupid if you think that we can start again (start again)  
Are you joking? Must be joking  
You ain't laughin', I ain't smokin'  
Must be crazy if you think that we can start again

Are you crazy?  
Are you crazy?  
Are you crazy?  
Are you crazy?  
Must be stupid if you think that we can start again  
Are you joking? Must be joking

Must be crazy if you think that we can start again

You don't understand  
There's no second chance for us, baby  
It's not a game, so why are you tryin' to play me?  
Now I gotta go, I'm not gonna stay and watch you cry

'Cause I'm hurting, baby, hurting, baby  
Look what you did
