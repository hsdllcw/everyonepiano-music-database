### The Other Girl歌词：

Kelsea Ballerini：  
I bet you're from out west somewhere  
Hazel eyes and dark brown hair  
And everything you wear fits you just right  
I bet you drink martinis dry  
And never let 'em see you cry  
I bet you're more promiscuous than I  
Kelsea Ballerini/Halsey：  
I bet you're bold I bet that's why you seem to occupy his mind  
I bet you're smart but do you know about me  
Is it you  
Kelsea Ballerini：  
Is it me Is it you  
Tell me who who's the other girl  
Who's the first Who's the fool  
Who's the diamond Who's the pearl  
Are you mad Me too  
And I wonder in his world  
Is it me Is it you  
Who's the other girl  
Halsey：  
Who's gonna put on the red dress  
Scarlet letter on her chest  
Can't love with this on her conscience  
Tell me who's the other girl Girl girl girl  
Halsey：  
Are you the one he's talkin' to  
When he gets up and leaves the room  
He comes back with a distance in his eyes  
Eyes  
Maybe I should be the one to leave  
But d**n when he starts lovin' me  
It makes me think I'm all that's on his mind  
I I  
Halsey：  
Is it me Is it you  
Tell me who who's the other girl  
Who's the first Who's the fool  
Who's the diamond Who's the pearl  
Are you mad Me too  
And I wonder in his world  
Is it me Is it you  
Who's the other girl  
Halsey：  
Who's gonna put on the red dress  
Scarlet letter on her chest  
Can't love with this on her conscience  
Tell me who's the other girl Girl girl girl  
Halsey/Kelsea Ballerini：  
I bet you're cool  
I bet that's why you seem to occupy his time  
I bet by now you know about me  
You know about me  
Kelsea Ballerini/Halsey：  
Is it me  
Is it me  
Is it you  
Is it you  
Tell me who who's the other girl  
Who's the first  
Who's the first  
Who's the fool  
Who's the fool Yeah  
Who's the diamond Who's the pearl  
Are you mad  
Are you mad  
Me too  
Me too  
And I wonder in his world  
Is it me  
Is it me  
Is it you  
Is it you  
Who's the other girl  
Halsey：  
Who's gonna put on the red dress  
Scarlet letter on her chest  
Can't love with this on her conscience  
Tell me who's the other girl Girl girl girl
