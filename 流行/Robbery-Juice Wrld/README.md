### Robbery歌词：

Man what  
This s**t funny  
I was like  
Oof this hennessy strong as f**k boy  
She told me put my heart in the bag in the bag  
And nobody gets hurt nobody  
Now I'm running from her love I'm not fast fast  
So I'm making it worse  
Now I'm digging up a grave from my past  
I'm a whole different person I'm a whole different person  
It's a gift and a curse  
But I cannot reverse it  
I can't reverse it  
It was a gift and a curse  
And now I'm drinkin' too much so I'ma talk with a slur  
Last time I saw you it ended in a blur  
I woke up in a hearse  
She said you loved me first first  
One thing my dad told me was  
Never let your woman know when you're insecure  
So I put gucci on the fur  
And I put my wrist on iceberg  
One thing my heart tells me is  
Flex on a ho every time they're insecure  
Ooh I'm running from you  
Is your love for real for real for real  
Is your love really true  
She told me put my heart in the bag in the bag  
And nobody gets hurt nobody  
Now I'm running from her love I'm not fast fast  
So I'm making it worse  
Now I'm digging up a grave from my past  
I'm a whole different person person  
It's a gift and a curse curse  
But I cannot reverse it  
You gave me the runaround  
I really hate the runaround  
You really got me paranoid  
I always keep a gun around  
You always give me butterflies  
When you come around  
When you come around  
When you come around  
You let me know love is not the answer  
Not the answer not the answer  
I love to do drugs so mind my manners  
I get high when you don't decide to answer  
Phone home I need to phone home  
I'm throwing rocks at your window I need to go home  
I don't wanna leave  
I just wanna be with you  
You you you  
She told me put my heart in the bag in the bag  
And nobody gets hurt nobody  
Now I'm running from her love I'm not fast fast  
So I'm making it worse making it worse  
Now I'm digging up a grave from my past  
I'm a whole different person I'm a whole different person  
It's a gift and a curse it's a gift and a curse  
But I cannot reverse it
