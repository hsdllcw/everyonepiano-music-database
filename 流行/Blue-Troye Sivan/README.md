### Blue歌词：

Life it's hard, I know  
All your lights are red, but I'm green to go  
Used to see you high, now you're only low  
All your lights are red but I'm green to go

I want you  
I'll colour me blue  
Anything it takes to make you stay  
Only seeing myself  
When I'm looking up at you  
I want you  
I'll colour me blue  
Anything it takes to make you stay  
Only seeing myself  
When I'm looking up at you

I can't say no  
Though the lights are on  
There's nobody home  
Swore I'd never lose control  
Then I fell in love with a heart that beats so slow

I want you  
I'll colour me blue  
Anything it takes to make you stay  
Only seeing myself  
When I'm looking up at you  
I want you  
I'll colour me blue  
Anything it takes to make you stay  
Only seeing myself  
When I'm looking up at you

I know you're seeing black and white  
So I'll paint you a clear blue sky  
Without you I am colour-blind  
It's raining every time I open my eyes  
I know you're seeing black and white  
So I'll paint you a clear blue sky  
Without you I am colour-blind  
It's raining every time I open my eyes

I want you  
I'll colour me blue  
Only seeing myself  
When I'm looking up at you  
When I'm looking up at you

I want you  
I'll colour me blue  
Anything it takes to make you stay  
Only seeing myself  
When I'm looking up at you  
I want you  
I'll colour me blue  
Anything it takes to make you stay  
Only seeing myself  
When I'm looking up at you

I want you  
I'll colour me blue  
Anything it takes to make you stay  
Only seeing myself  
When I'm looking up at you
