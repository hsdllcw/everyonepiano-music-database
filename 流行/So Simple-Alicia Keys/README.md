### So Simple歌词：

It would be, it would be  
It would be so simple  
What it is ain't what it was  
What should it be when it comes to you and....  
How it seems ain't how it is  
There's been a change when it comes to me and...

[Chorus:]

Oh baby you  
Oh baby me  
Oh maybe we can try another day  
Another way  
All in my mind  
I'm wondering why we cannot find  
What was left of the beginning  
If I could  
Meet you again,  
Miss you again,  
Kiss you again  
It would be, it would be so simple  
Cause I would love you again  
Hold you again  
Need you again  
It would be, it would be  
Could it be, could it be so simple  
Now it's hardly simple,  
It's just simply hard  
When it comes to you and  
I find myself not being myself  
Just to avoid all this confrontation with  
Oh baby you  
Oh baby me  
Oh maybe we can put this armor down  
And settle down  
Oh it's off track  
That is a fact  
Can we get it back  
Get it back to the beginning  
If I could meet you again,  
Miss you again,  
Kiss you again  
It would be, it would be so simple  
Cause I would love you again  
Hold you again  
Need you again  
It would be, it would be  
Could it be, could it be so simple  
Don't you know that it would be  
Don't you know that it could be  
Don't you know that it would be  
Meet you again,  
Miss you again,  
Kiss you again  
It would be, it would be so simple  
Cause I would love you again  
Hold you again  
Need you again  
It would be, it would be  
Could it be, so simple  
[Ad libs and out...]
