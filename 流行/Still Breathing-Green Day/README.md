### Still Breathing歌词：

I'm like a child looking off on the horizon  
I'm like an ambulance that's turning on the sirens  
Oh, I'm still alive  
I'm like a soldier coming home for the first time  
I dodged a bullet and I walked across a landmine  
Oh, I'm still alive

Am I bleeding? Am I bleeding from the storm?  
Just shine a light into the wreckage, so far away, away

'Cause I'm still breathing  
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own  
My head's above the rain and roses  
Making my way away  
'Cause I'm still breathing  
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own  
My head's above the rain and roses  
Making my way away  
My way to you

I'm like a junkie tying off for the last time  
I'm like a loser that's betting on his last dime  
Oh, I'm still alive  
I'm like a son that was raised without a father  
I'm like a mother barely keeping it together  
Oh, I'm still alive

Am I bleeding? Am I bleeding from the storm?  
Just shine a light into the wreckage, so far away, away

'Cause I'm still breathing  
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own  
My head's above the rain and roses  
Making my way away  
'Cause I'm still breathing  
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own  
My head's above the rain and roses  
Making my way, away, away...

As I walked out on the ledge  
Are you scared to death to live?  
I've been running all my life  
Just to find a home that's for the restless  
And the truth that's in the message  
Making my way, away, away

'Cause I'm still breathing  
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own  
My head's above the rain and roses  
Making my way away  
'Cause I'm still breathing  
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own  
My head's above the rain and roses  
Making my way, away  
'Cause I'm still breathing  
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own  
My head's above the rain and roses  
Making my way, away  
My way to you
