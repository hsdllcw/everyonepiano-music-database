### 2step歌词：

I had a bad week  
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep  
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over  
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment  
You know you take all of my stress right down  
Help me get it off my chest and out  
Into the ether with the rest of this mess  
That just keeps us depressed  
We forget that we're here right now  
'Coz we're living life at a different pace  
Stuck in a constant race keep the pressure on  
You're bound to break  
Something's got to change  
We should just be cancelling all our plans  
And not give a damn  
If we're missing out on what the people think is right  
Seeing through a picture behind the screen  
And forget to be lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read  
I think maybe you and me  
Oh we should head out to the place where the music plays  
And then we'll go all night  
Two stepping with the woman I love  
All my troubles turn to nothing when I'm in your eyes  
Electrified we'll keep turning up and go all night  
Oh we had dips and falls in our time  
But we know what it feels to be low then up alone and then loved  
And all we need is us to go  
All night night  
Two stepping with the woman I love  
Night yeah all we need is us  
Baby  
Sun coming up when we walk out  
We lost the track of time  
Everything that I been dealing with ain't even cross my mind  
I don't see nobody in here but us for real  
For you I'm blind  
We go anywhere  
It don't take much for us to catch a vibe  
Come here I need to tell you something  
Let me whisper in your ear  
Do whatever to get you there I'll put you on a Lear  
Private island for a month straight  
They'll think you disappeared  
Lamb truck look good on ya  
I'm copping you that urus  
I think I'm bout ready to make love in this club  
Only thing I need is my drank and my d**gs  
I done got on 10 and forgot where I was  
Some parts I don't like but this part I love  
Only me and my guys  
I been having me a good time  
You can see it in all in my eyes  
Two stepping with shorty  
Got her rocking side to side  
You should let me know when you get ready to ride cause  
We'll go all night  
Two stepping with the woman I love  
All my troubles turn to nothing when I'm in your eyes  
Electrified we'll keep turning up and go all night  
Oh we had dips and falls in our time  
But we know what it feels to be low then up alone then loved  
And all we need is us to go  
All night night  
Two step and with the woman I love  
Night yeah all we need is us to go all night  
Night night  
Two step and with the woman I love  
Night yeah all we need is us to go all night
