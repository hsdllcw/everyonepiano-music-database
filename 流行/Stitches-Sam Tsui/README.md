### Stitches歌词：

I thought that I've been hurt before  
But no one's ever left me quite this sore  
Your words cut deeper than a knife  
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life  
Got a feeling that I'm going under  
But I know that I'll make it out alive  
If I quit calling you my lover  
Move on  
You watch me bleed till I can't breathe  
shaking, falling onto my knees  
And now that I'm without your kisses  
I'll be needing stitches  
Tripping over myself  
Aching, begging you to come help  
And now that I'm without your kisses  
I'll be needing stitches  
Just like a moth drawn to a flame  
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain  
Your bitter heart cold to a touch  
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow  
I'm left seeing red on my own  
Got a feeling that I'm going under  
But I know that I'll make it out alive  
If I quit calling you my lover  
Move on  
You watch me bleed till I can't breathe  
shaking, falling onto my knees  
And now that I'm without your kisses  
I'll be needing stitches  
Tripping over myself  
Aching, begging you to come help  
cause now that I'm without your kisses  
I'll be needing stitches  
Needle and a thread, gotta get you out of my head  
Needle and a thread, gonna wind up dead  
Needle and a thread, gotta get you out of my head  
Needle and a thread, gonna wind up dead  
Needle and a thread, gotta get you out of my head  
Needle and a thread, gonna wind up dead  
Needle and a thread, gotta get you out of my head, get you out of my head  
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe  
Shaking, falling onto my knees  
And now that I'm without your kisses  
I'll be needing stitches  
Tripping over myself  
I'm aching, begging you to come help  
'Cause now that I'm without your kisses  
I'll be needing stitches  
I'm without your kisses  
I'll be needing stitches
