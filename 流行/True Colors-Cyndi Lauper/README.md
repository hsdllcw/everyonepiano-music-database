**True Colors** 是美国女歌手Cyndi Lauper第二张专辑<True
Colors>中的一首同名单曲。入围第29届格莱美奖最佳流行女歌手与在第4届MTV音乐录影带大奖最佳女歌手录影带。此曲曾作为柯达胶卷的广告歌曲。

_True Colors_ 由Billy Steinberg与Tom
Kelly操刀，是专辑中唯一非Cyndi所写的曲子，但此曲却成为传唱至今的隽永经典，后人更是翻唱不断。真挚略哑的嗓音，与简单纯粹的弦乐、吉他编曲，及充满正能量的歌词让这首歌的张力直接穿透身体，触动最深层无法言喻的情绪。

Cyndi对这首歌曲之所以产生共鸣，是因为这首歌让Cyndi想起因艾滋病而逝的旧交Gregory
Natal。这首歌因此也成为同志圈的代表歌曲，Cyndi也因此建立了"True
Colors"基金会，主要受益群众为男女同志人群，双性恋以及变性人等弱势群体。

### True Colors歌词：

You with the sad eyes  
Don't be discouraged  
Oh I realize  
It's hard to take courage  
In a world full of people  
You can lose sight of it all  
And the darkness inside you  
Can make you feel so small

But I see your true colors  
Shining through  
I see your true colors  
And that's why I love you  
So don't be afraid to let them show  
Your true colors  
True colors are beautiful,  
Like a rainbow

Show me a smile then,  
Don't be unhappy, can't remember  
When I last saw you laughing

If this world makes you crazy  
And you've taken all you can bear  
You call me up  
Because you know I'll be there

And I'll see your true colors  
Shining through  
I see your true colors  
And that's why I love you  
So don't be afraid to let them show  
Your true colors  
True colors are beautiful,  
Like a rainbow

[Whisper:] Can't remember, when I last saw you laugh.

If this world makes you crazy  
And you've taken all you can bear  
You call me up  
Because you know I'll be there

And I'll see your true colors  
Shining through  
I see your true colors  
And that's why I love you  
So don't be afraid to let them show  
Your true colors  
True colors  
True colors are shining through

I see your true colors  
And that's why I love you  
So don't be afraid to let them show  
Your true colors  
True colors are beautiful,  
Like a rainbow.
