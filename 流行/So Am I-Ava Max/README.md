### So Am I歌词：

Do you ever feel like a misfit  
Everything inside you is dark and twisted  
Oh but it's okay to be different  
'Cause baby so am I  
So am I so am I so am I I I I I  
Can you hear the whispers all across the room  
You feel her eyes all over you like cheap perfume  
You're beautiful but misunderstood  
So why you tryna be just like the neighborhood  
I can see it I know what you're feelin'  
So let me tell you 'bout my little secret  
I'm a little crazy underneath this  
Underneath this  
Do you ever feel like a misfit  
Everything inside you is dark and twisted  
Oh but it's okay to be different  
'Cause baby so am I  
So am I so am I so am I  
Do you ever feel like an outcast  
You don't have to fit into the format  
Oh but it's okay to be different  
'Cause baby so am I  
So am I so am I so am I I I I I  
Oh so dressed so fancy like Sid and Nancy  
Yeah  
Walkin' Killer Queen gotta keep 'em guessin'  
So baby come pass me a lighter  
We're gonna leave 'em on fire  
We're the sinners and the blessings  
I can see it I know what you're feelin'  
So let me tell you 'bout my little secret  
I'm a little crazy underneath this  
Underneath this ooh  
Do you ever feel like a misfit  
Everything inside you is dark and twisted  
Oh but it's okay to be different  
'Cause baby so am I  
So am I so am I so am I  
Do you ever feel like an outcast  
You don't have to fit into the format  
Oh but it's okay to be different  
'Cause baby so am I  
So am I so am I so am I I I I I  
Ah ah ah  
You're king and you're queen  
You're strong and you're weak  
You're bound but so free  
Ah ah ah  
So come and join me  
And call me Harley  
And we'll make a scene  
Do you ever feel like a misfit  
Everything inside you is dark and twisted  
Oh but it's okay to be different  
'Cause baby so am I  
So am I so am I so am I  
Do you ever feel like an outcast  
You don't have to fit into the format  
Oh but it's okay to be different  
'Cause baby so am I  
So am I so am I so am I I I I I
