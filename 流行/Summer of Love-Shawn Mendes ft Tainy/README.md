加拿大才子Shawn Mendes与波多黎各唱片制作人Tainy合作带来最新单曲《 **Summer Of Love**
》带领我们沉静在那充满爱而又美好的夏天。

此曲于8月20日发行，整首歌充斥着夏日的活力，吉他声配着Mendes的嗓音仿佛夹着夏日的阳光，夏天的气息和爱的感觉扑面而来，空气中弥漫着柠檬海盐的汽水味和少年干净的白衬衫的味道，在松软沙滩上踩出深浅不一的脚印，又或是抱着切开一半的冰西瓜……
清爽的热带风暴迎面而来，柠檬、甜橙加上一点点薄荷，这才是最好的夏天，所谓Summer和Love也不过如此吧？

### Summer of Love歌词：

Kisses on your body were like heaven  
We were taking it slow  
Tangled in the sheets until the evening  
There was nowhere to go yeah  
We were in a daze learning each other&apos;s shapes  
Tracing shadows of rain down your back oh  
Kisses on your body you&apos;re my memory baby nothing comes close  
It was the summer of love  
A delicate daydream  
And for a couple of months  
It felt like we were 18  
It was the summer of  
La-la-love

It was the summer of  
La-la-love

Didn&apos;t know how much I need ya  
Hate it when I have to leave ya  
I&apos;ve been taking mental pictures  
For when I miss you in the winter  
Staying up until the sunrise  
Praying it won&apos;t be the last time  
It was the summer of love  
A delicate daydream  
And for a couple of months  
It felt like we were 18  
It was the summer of  
La-la-love  
La-la-love yeah  
It was the summer of  
La-la-love  
La-la-love  
Kisses on your body were like heaven  
We were taking it slow  
Tangled in the sheets until the evening  
There was nowhere to go no  
It was the summer of love  
It was the summer of love  
A delicate daydream  
And for a couple of months  
It felt like we were 18 yeah  
It was the summer of  
La-la-love  
La-la-love yeah  
It was the summer of  
La-la-love  
La-la-love  
It was the summer of  
La-la-love  
La-la-love yeah  
It was the summer of  
La-la-love  
La-la-love  
It was the summer of
