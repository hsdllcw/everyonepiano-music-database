### Hymn歌词：

Even the stars and the moon  
Don't shine quite like we do  
Dreamers searchin' for the truth  
Go on, read about us in the news  
Pretty reckless, pretty wild  
Talking shit and we'll just smile  
Don't you see these fuckin' crowns?  
If you know what I mean, you on the team  
This is a hymn for the hymnless, kids with no religion  
Yeah, we keep on sinning, yeah, we keep on singing  
Flying down the highway, backseat of the Hyundai  
Pull it to the front, let it run, we don't valet  
Sorry if you're starstruck, blame it on the stardust  
I know that I'm perfect, even though I'm fucked up  
Hymn for the hymnless, don't need no forgiveness  
'Cause if there's a heaven, don't care if we get in  
This is a hymn, hymn, hymn for how we live, live, live  
This is a hymn, hymn, hymn for how we live, for how we live  
After all we've been through  
No, we won't stand and salute  
So we just ride, we just cruise  
Livin' like there's nothing left to lose  
If we die before we wake  
Who we are is no mistake  
This is just the way we're made  
You know what I mean, you on the team  
This is a hymn for the hymnless, kids with no religion  
Yeah, we keep on sinning, yeah, we keep on singing  
Flying down the highway, backseat of the Hyundai  
Pull it to the front, let it run, we don't valet  
Sorry if you're starstruck, blame it on the stardust  
I know that I'm perfect, even though I'm fucked up  
Hymn for the hymnless, don't need no forgiveness  
'Cause if there's a heaven, don't care if we get in  
This is a hymn, hymn, hymn for how we live, live, live  
This is a hymn, hymn, hymn for how we live, for how we live  
This is a hymn for the hymnless, kids with no religion  
Yeah, we keep on sinning, yeah, we keep on singing  
Flying down the highway, yeah, we do it our way  
High as outer space, we don't hear what the rest say  
Sorry if you're starstruck, blame it on the stardust  
I know that I'm perfect, even though I'm fucked up  
Hymn for the hymnless, don't need no forgiveness  
'Cause if there's a heaven, don't care if we get in  
This is a hymn, hymn, hymn for how we live, live, live  
This is a hymn, hymn, hymn for how we live, for how we live
