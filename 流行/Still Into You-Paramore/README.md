**Still Into You**
是Paramore演唱的。这个年轻的乐队成立于美国Franklin，Tennessee，当13岁就开始唱歌的Hayley从她的老家Meridian搬到当地时遇到了同样热爱音乐的两兄弟Josh
Farro和Zac Farro.随后bass手Jeremy Davis，Hunter
Lamb加入乐队，一再增添了歌曲更为坚实的音乐架构。他们给自己起了一个特殊的名字 - Paramore。

### Still Into You歌词：

Can't count the years one hand  
That we've been together  
I need the other one to hold you.  
Make you feel, make you feel better.  
It's not a walk in the park  
To love each other.  
But when our fingers interlock,  
Can't deny, can't deny you're worth it  
Cause after all this time.  
I'm still into you  
I should be over all the butterflies  
But I'm into you (I'm in to you)  
And baby even on our worst nights  
I'm into you (I'm into you)  
Let em wonder how we got this far  
Cause I don't really need to wonder at all  
Yeah after all this time  
I'm still into you  
Recount the night that I first  
Met your mother  
And on the drive back to my house  
I told you that, I told you that I loved ya.  
You felt the weight of the world  
Fall off your shoulder  
And to your favorite song  
We sang along to the start of forever  
And after all this time.  
I'm still into you  
I should be over all the butterflies  
But I'm into you (I'm in to you)  
And baby even on our worst nights  
I'm into you (I'm into you)  
Let em wonder how we got this far  
Cause I don't really need to wonder at all  
Yeah after all this time  
I'm still into you  
Some things just,  
Some things just make sense  
And one of those is you and I  
Some things just,  
Some things just make sense  
And even after all this time  
I'm into You  
Baby not a day goes by that  
I'm not into you  
I should be over all the butterflies  
But I'm into you (I'm in to you)  
And baby even on our worst nights  
I'm into you (I'm into you)  
Let em wonder how we got this far  
Cause I don't really need to wonder at all  
Yeah after all this time  
I'm still into you  
I'm still into you  
I'm still into you
