### Green Light歌词：

I do my make-up in somebody else's car  
We order different drinks at the same bars  
I know about what you did and I wanna scream the truth  
She thinks you love the beach, you're such a damn liar  
Those great whites, they have big teeth  
Hope they bite you  
Thought you said that you would always be in love  
But you're not in love, no more  
Did it frighten you  
How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?  
On the light up floor  
But I hear sounds in my mind  
Brand new sounds in my mind  
But, honey, I'll be seein' you 'ever I go  
But, honey, I'll be seein' you down every road  
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it  
'Cause, honey, I'll come get my things, but I can't let go  
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it  
Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go  
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it  
Sometimes I wake up in a different bedroom  
I whisper things, the city sings them back to you  
All those rumors, they have big teeth  
Hope they bite you  
Thought you said that you would always be in love  
But you're not in love, no more  
Did it frighten you  
How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?  
On the light up floor  
But I hear sounds in my mind  
Brand new sounds in my mind  
But, honey, I'll be seein' you 'ever I go  
But, honey, I'll be seein' you down every road  
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it  
'Cause, honey, I'll come get my things, but I can't let go  
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it  
Oh, honey, I'll come get my things, but I can't let go  
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it  
Yeah, honey, I'll come get my things, but I can't let go  
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it  
Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go  
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it  
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it  
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it  
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it  
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it  
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it  
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
