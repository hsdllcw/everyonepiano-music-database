### Your Body Is a Wonderland歌词：

We got the afternoon  
You got this room for two  
One thing I've left to do  
Discover me  
Discovering you

One mile to every inch of  
Your skin like porcelain  
One pair of candy lips and  
Your bubblegum tongue

And if you want love  
We'll make it  
Swim in a deep sea  
Of blankets  
Take all your big plans  
And break 'em  
This is bound to be a while

Your body is a wonderland  
Your body is a wonder (I'll use my hands)  
Your body is a wonderland

Something 'bout the way the hair falls in your face  
I love the shape you take when crawling towards the pillowcase  
You tell me where to go and though I might leave to find it  
I'll never let your head hit the bed without my hand behind it

you want love?  
We'll make it  
Swim in a deep sea  
Of blankets  
Take all your big plans  
And break 'em  
This is bound to be a while

Your body is a wonderland  
Your body is a wonder (I'll use my hands)  
Your body is a wonderland  
(I'll never speak again... I'll use my hands)

Damn baby  
You frustrate me  
I know you're mine, all mine, all mine  
But you look so good it hurts sometimes

Your body is a wonderland  
(I'll never speak again... I'll use my hands)  
Your body is a wonder (I'll use my hands)  
Your body is a wonderland  
(I'll never speak again... I'll use my hands)  
Your body is a wonderland
