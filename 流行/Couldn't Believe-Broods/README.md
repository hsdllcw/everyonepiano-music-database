### Couldn’t Believe歌词：

You got the key from under the mat  
Took off your coat and hung up your hat  
I burnt my fingers trying to help  
You burnt the wood, you burnt the wood, you burnt the wood

We hid under blankets of ignorance  
Cause that was the only time that it all made sense  
You gave me a list of your promises  
Listen to this, listen to this, listen to this

And I couldn't believe my eyes  
I couldn't believe my ears  
I couldn't believe my luck  
I couldn't believe you're here

And I couldn’t believe my eyes  
I couldn’t believe my ears  
But I’m looking at you now  
And I can’t believe we’re here

You never kept anyone for long  
I was the worst at being alone  
You came around when I needed you  
Let’s give in to this, give in to this, give in to this

And I couldn't believe my eyes  
I couldn't believe my ears  
I couldn't believe my luck  
I couldn't believe you're here

And I couldn’t believe my eyes  
I couldn’t believe my ears  
But I’m looking at you now  
And I can’t believe we’re here

You care for me  
You ask of me  
I'll do it

And I couldn't believe my eyes  
I couldn't believe my ears  
I couldn't believe my luck  
I couldn't believe you're here

And I couldn’t believe my eyes  
I couldn’t believe my ears  
But I’m looking at you now  
And I can’t believe we’re here

And I couldn’t believe my eyes  
I couldn't believe we're here
