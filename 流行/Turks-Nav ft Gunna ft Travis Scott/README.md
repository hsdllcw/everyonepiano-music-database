### Turks歌词：

Wheezy outta here  
NAV：  
I'm a late bloomer third year on the scene  
Twenty racks don't feel like nothin' to me  
Came from the streets it turned me to a beast  
Invisible set diamonds huggin' my piece  
Book me for a show I need eighty at least  
I want the smoke ain't no keepin' the peace  
Keep me a razor when I'm in the East  
Open 'em up just like a surgery  
Everything burnin' around me I'm lit  
Show a lil' attitude swap out the b***h  
I spent two-fifty don't know where it went  
My hood on my back I gotta represent  
Toronto you useless you don't got a pole  
Warm that boy up he got shot in the cold  
Thirty rounds in the clip let it unload  
I f**k the b***h I picked right out of Vogue  
Took twenty b***hes on my first vacay  
I ain't pickin' up I'm in Turks lil' baby  
Every other watch got diamonds in the face  
Pullin' out ask to take a taste lil' baby  
Pullin' out fifty racks walkin' out of Chase  
If I drop dead I'll be hard to replace  
Hardly get thirsty got water like a lake  
My brother got locked another bond I gotta pay  
Gunna/Future：  
Trappin' on the block I'd never serve a cop  
I always kept a Glock I ain't 'bout to see the grave  
'Bout to see the grave  
Pull up I'll make a quick stop  
Yeah  
I shop one stop I'm high for seven days  
High for seven days  
Who is that lil' n***a icy hoppin' out a Wraith  
Hoppin' out a Wraith  
Chopper get it choppin' like a blade  
Chop  
You ain't get no money but you poppin' on your page  
Poppin' on your page  
Trust me we could never be the same  
Never be the same  
You know I like to flirt no skirts in Turks  
Yeah  
I'm puttin' in work I beat her out the frame  
Beat her out the frame  
Wheezy outta here  
She sweet I was movin' off a Perc'  
I bought her a Birk' and a birthday cake  
Birthday cake  
Line his a*s up like a barber do the fade  
Barber do the fade  
Fed your ho crêpes and grapes  
Cash told me "Wait it's a billion on the way"  
Billion on the way  
We just split a billi' with the gang  
NAV：  
Took twenty b***hes on my first vacay  
I ain't pickin' up I'm in Turks lil' baby  
Every other watch got diamonds in the face  
Pullin' out ask to take a taste lil' baby  
Pullin' out fifty racks walkin' out of Chase  
If I drop dead I'll be hard to replace  
Hardly get thirsty got water like a lake  
My brother got locked another bond I gotta pay  
Travis Scott：  
First time in Turks had a whole bunch of work  
Had to bring two jets had a whole lot of babes  
Yeah  
I first take a game-changin' verse  
Swear the change gon' hurt but it really ain't a game  
Yeah  
Shawty like to twerk I bring the rage  
Yeah  
Really get to trippin' on the stage  
Never ever let 'em see the man unless they pay  
Alright  
N***as havin' beef I hope they pray  
Cactus Jack me up and down head to toe  
Make sure the ones you with on go  
Make sure the ones you with is with it  
Make sure the ones you with ah  
Yeah  
She need a quick tan come to Turks with the G's  
Yeah  
Work for that body need more than degrees  
Fillin' her nose with some s**t I can ski with  
Say this her first time it's hard to believe  
NAV：  
Took twenty b***hes on my first vacay  
I ain't pickin' up I'm in Turks lil' baby  
Every other watch got diamonds in the face  
Pullin' out ask to take a taste lil' baby  
Pullin' out fifty racks walkin' out of Chase  
If I drop dead I'll be hard to replace  
Hardly get thirsty got water like a lake  
My brother got locked another bond I gotta pay
