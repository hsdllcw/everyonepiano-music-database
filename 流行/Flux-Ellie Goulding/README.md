### Flux歌词：

Remember me in a simple way  
Not what I did or said  
When I think of you now  
I just think of the day we met  
Don't forget me like I didn't care  
Yeah I stole from myself  
Just to make you complete  
Flux flux  
I don't think you have the patience  
I don't think you know the difference  
Flux flux  
And I don't want cute imitations  
I know you wanted to save me  
And I'm still in love  
With the idea of loving you  
It's a state of flux  
But it's not enough  
And I'm still in love  
With the idea of loving you  
It's a state of flux  
I just keep holding on  
Would you be taking me higher  
Would we be living as liars  
I wanna know I wanna know  
When the memories pack up and leave  
It will set me free  
All those days on the beach  
Will be washing away from me  
I will keep it secretly just to keep the peace  
Keep steering this ship  
Through the dark and the stormy seas  
Flux flux  
I should be counting my blessings  
Staying safe in confusion  
Flux flux  
And maybe I'm learning my lesson  
I know you wanted to save me  
I'm still in love  
With the idea of loving you  
It's a state of flux  
But it's not enough  
And I'm still in love  
With the idea of loving you  
It's a state of flux  
I just keep holding on  
Would you be taking me higher  
Would we be living as liars  
I wanna know I wanna know  
Would we be living in Camden  
Getting a ticket to your bed  
I wanna know I wanna know  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh I'm still in love  
With the idea of loving you oh with the idea  
It's a state of flux it's a state of  
But it's not enough it's not enough  
I'm still in love  
With the idea of loving you  
It's a state of flux  
I just keep holding on  
Oh I just keep holding on  
I'm still in love  
With the idea of loving you  
It's a state of flux  
But it's not enough  
Oh I'm still in love  
I'm still in love  
With the idea of loving you  
It's a state of flux  
I just keep holding on
