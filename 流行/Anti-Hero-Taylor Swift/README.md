《 **Anti-Hero** 》是美国女歌手泰勒•斯威夫特（Taylor
Swift）演唱的一首歌曲，收录于2022年10月21日发行的专辑《Midnights》中。

歌曲融合了一丝city
pop风格的编曲，泰勒低音中带着坚定，与高音相和而成，使得这首歌颇具超现实主义风格。同时，她将自己作为一个两极化人物的故事展述。“Sometimes, I
feel like everybody is a sexy baby, And I'm a monster on the
hill.”泰勒用令人发笑的歌词自嘲。生活充满矛盾和困惑，而这些都出自我本身。副歌中与自己对话“Hi. I'm the problem, it's
me.”与其深陷无限的自耗中，不如早日与自己和解。是的，我就是那个问题。坦诚地面对自己吧。

在 _Anti-Hero_
看似诙谐幽默的歌词背后，其实描述了自卑与自恋人格的对比反差。和大多数人一样，Taylor有时也会缺乏安全感，讨厌自己的不完美，直到最终跟自己和解。看完MV你就会发现：“每个我都是我讨厌的自己，肥胖，巨大，不合群，孤僻，不讨人喜欢，好像每一个我都是怪咖，所以我厌恶自己，但是最终每一个我讨厌的自己围坐在一起喝着酒，接纳每一个真实的自己”。

### Anti-Hero歌词：

I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser  
Midnights become my afternoons  
When my depression works the graveyard shift  
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room  
I should not be left to my own devices  
They come with prices and vices  
I end up in crisis  
Tale as old as time  
I wake up screaming from dreaming  
One day I'll watch as you're leaving  
Cause you got tired of my scheming  
For the last time  
It's me hi I'm the problem it's me  
At teatime everybody agrees  
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror  
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero  
Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby  
And I'm a monster on the hill  
Too big to hang out slowly lurching toward your favorite city  
Pierced through the heart but never killed  
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism  
Like some kind of congressman  
Tale as old as time  
I wake up screaming from dreaming  
One day I'll watch as you're leaving  
And life will lose all its meaning  
For the last time  
It's me hi I'm the problem it's me  
At teatime everybody agrees  
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror  
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero  
I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money  
She thinks I left them in the will  
The family gathers around and reads it and then someone screams out  
"She's laughing up at us from hell"  
It's me hi I'm the problem it's me  
It's me hi I'm the problem it's me  
It's me hi everybody agrees  
Everybody agrees  
It's me hi I'm the problem it's me (I'm the problem it's me)  
At teatime everybody agrees  
Everybody agrees  
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror  
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
