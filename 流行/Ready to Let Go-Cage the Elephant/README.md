### Ready to Let Go歌词：

Sun went down sun went down over Pompeii  
On both sides the vow was broken  
Oh my my I'm the one  
Trying to hide this damage done  
One day all our secrets will be spoken  
As we slow dance I became your statue frozen  
'Times I wonder are we just a puff of smoke yeah  
Underneath this bed of ashes still withholding everything  
Like we were never close  
Don't you worry baby no sense trying to change it  
I'mma strike these matches never had control  
I'm ready to let go no was I fooling myself  
I'mma spread these ashes never had control  
I'm ready I'm ready I'm ready to let go  
Sun went down sun went down over Pompeii  
On holy ground our vows were broken  
We met up we broke bread  
I was blue your dress was red ain't it strange  
We both knew this day was coming  
As we slow dance I became your statue frozen  
'Times I wonder are we just a puff of smoke yeah  
Underneath this bed of ashes still withholding everything  
Like we were never close  
Don't you worry baby no sense trying to change it  
I'mma strike these matches never had control  
I'm ready to let go no was I fooling myself  
I'mma spread these ashes never had control  
I'm ready I'm ready I'm ready to let go  
Don't you worry baby no sense trying to change it  
I'mma strike these matches never had control  
I'm ready to let go no was I fooling myself  
I'mma spread these ashes never had control  
I'm ready I'm ready I'm ready to let go
