### Easy Come Easy Go歌词：

All my friends are gone I don't blame them  
I guess I'll move on do the same thing  
So I wrote a song to be my lullaby  
Sing me to sleep at night open my third eye  
I'm not gon' lie to you I miss you so much  
Tell me what I did wrong to lose touch  
I'm not gon' lie to you this has been a hard year  
Oh I wish that you were here  
I just need to let it go waitin' on a miracle  
Guess that's just the way it goes easy come easy go  
I just need to let it go turn it down and lay low  
It's just the way it goes easy come easy go  
Sometimes I drive a little too fast  
Think I'm runnin' from demons of my past  
So I wrote a song to help me slow down  
Keep my mind straight but it's a bit late  
I'm not gon' lie to you I miss you so much  
Tell me what I did wrong to lose touch  
I'm not gon' lie to you this has been a hard year  
Oh I wish that you were here  
I just need to let it go waitin' on a miracle  
Guess that's just the way it goes easy come easy go  
I just need to let it go turn it down and lay low  
It's just the way it goes easy come easy go  
I just need to let it go  
I just need to let it go  
Waitin' on a miracle  
Waitin' on a miracle  
Guess that's just the way it goes  
Guess that's just the way it goes  
Easy come easy go  
I just need to let it go  
I just need to let it go  
Turn it down and lay low  
Lay low  
It's just the way it goes  
It's just the way it goes  
Easy come easy go  
Remember when you got sick cancer of the bone  
Everyone at school while you sitting at home  
In your wheelchair of grief find no relief  
We were there for the ups and downs  
And there for the constant rounds of chemo  
Yeah you know that you are our hero  
You were there when I was a zero  
And I swear I'll make things right before the long night  
Swear I'll make things right tomorrow  
But as for tonight  
I just need to let it go  
I just need to let it go  
Waitin' on a miracle  
Waitin' on a miracle  
Guess that's just the way it goes  
Guess that's just the way it goes  
Easy come easy go  
I just need to let it go  
I just need to let it go  
Turn it down and lay low  
Lay low  
It's just the way it goes  
It's just the way it goes  
Easy come easy go  
I just need to let it go  
I just need to let it go  
Waitin' on a miracle  
Waitin' on a miracle  
Guess that's just the way it goes  
Guess that's just the way it goes  
Easy come easy go  
I just need to let it go  
I just need to let it go  
Turn it down and lay low  
Lay low  
It's just the way it goes  
It's just the way it goes  
Easy come easy go  
I just need to let it go  
I just need to let it go  
Waitin' on a miracle  
Waitin' on a miracle  
Guess that's just the way it goes  
Guess that's just the way it goes  
Easy come easy go  
I just need to let it go  
I just need to let it go  
Turn it down and lay low  
Lay low  
It's just the way it goes
