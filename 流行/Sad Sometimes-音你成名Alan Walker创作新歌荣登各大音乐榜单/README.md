### Sad Sometimes歌词：

I've been dancing by myself tonight  
Close my eyes I'm fading with the lights  
Did you always keep me in the dark  
If you knew why did you let me stay  
Should'a never let you break my heart  
Now there is nothing left for me to say  
Cause I'm lost in the silence between you and me  
Now you're gone nothing's left of what used to be  
That's ok that's alright  
Go ahead and live your life  
That's ok that's alright  
But don't blame me if I get sad sometimes  
I still got a messed up point of view  
All I see in everything is you oh  
Did you always keep me in the dark  
If you knew why did you let me stay  
Should'a never let you break my heart  
Now there is nothing left for me to say  
Cause I'm lost in the silence between you and me  
Now you're gone nothing's left of what used to be  
That's ok that's alright  
Go ahead and live your life  
That's ok that's alright  
But don't blame me if I get sad sometimes  
But don't blame me if I get sad sometimes  
Sad sometimes  
Sad sometimes
