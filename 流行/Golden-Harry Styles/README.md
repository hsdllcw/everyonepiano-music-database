**Golden双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Golden_ 由 Harry Styles 演唱，收录于《Fine Line》专辑中。从60年代的复古摇滚到70~80年代的黄金摇滚， Harry
Styles越唱越远了，像是站在一个卷轴上，唱出他对音乐风格的喜好，也像是一个摇滚音乐史的演绎人，娓娓道来。他坚持了自己对音乐的诠释，牢牢把握着整张专辑的风格衔接。可以说这张专辑风格更具包容。

### Golden歌词：

Hey  
Golden golden golden as I open my eyes  
Holding focus hoping take me back to the light  
I know you were way too bright for me  
I'm hopeless broken so you wait for me in the sky  
Brown my skin just right  
You're so golden  
You're so golden  
I'm out of my head and I know that you're scared  
Because hearts get broken  
I don't want to be alone  
I don't want to be alone when it ends  
Don't wanna let you know  
I don't want to be alone  
But I can feel it take a hold  
I can feel it take a hold  
I can feel you take control  
I can feel you take control  
Of who I am and all I've ever known  
Lovin' is the antidote  
Golden  
You're so golden  
I don't want to be alone  
You're so golden  
You're so golden  
I'm out of my head and I know that you're scared  
Because hearts get broken  
I know that you're scared because I'm so open  
You're so golden  
I don't want to be alone  
You're so golden  
You're so golden  
You're so golden  
I'm out of my head and I know that you're scared  
Because hearts get broken
