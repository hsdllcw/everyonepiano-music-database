### Cirice歌词：

I feel your presence amongst us  
You cannot hide in the darkness  
Can you hear the rumble  
Can you hear the rumble that's calling  
I know your soul is not tainted  
Even though you've been told so  
Can you hear the rumble  
Can you hear the rumble that's calling  
I can feel the thunder that's breaking in your heart  
I can see through the scars inside you  
I can feel the thunder that's breaking in your heart  
I can see through the scars inside you  
A candle casting a faint glow  
You and I see eye to eye  
Can you hear the thunder  
Can you hear the thunder that's breaking  
Now there is nothing between us  
From now our merge is eternal  
Can't you see that you're lost  
Can't you see that you're lost without me  
I can feel the thunder that's breaking in your heart  
I can see through the scars inside you  
I can feel the thunder that's breaking in your heart  
I can see through the scars inside you  
Can't you see that you're lost without me  
I can feel the thunder that's breaking in your heart  
I can see through the scars inside you  
I can feel the thunder that's breaking in your heart  
I can see through the scars inside you  
I can feel the thunder that's breaking in your heart  
I can see through the scars inside you  
I can feel the thunder that's breaking in your heart  
I can see through the scars inside you
