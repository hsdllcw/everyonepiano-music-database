**Look at You** 是美国当代乡村第一才华双人组合Big & Rich的歌曲。虽然成长于美国乡村音乐重镇纳什维尔，但由“Big”Kenny
Alphin和前著名乡村组合Lonestar主唱John Rich组建的Big &
Rich组合的音乐却并不像传统的乡村音乐，她们的音乐变得更为多样化，加入了更多的摇滚成分。

### Look at You歌词：

Baby when I look at you, with them baby blues,  
cuttin' right through me.  
You set me on the rewind, back to the good times,  
when you couldn't get enough of me.  
I guess I givin' myself away.  
Sayin' all the things I never did say.  
I lose myself, there's nothing else I can do.  
Baby, when I look at you.

Yeah, baby when I look at you.

Last thing I thought I'd see was,  
you across the bar from me, and  
holdin' on to that turkey bottle,  
shootin' em down, and runnin' full throttle.  
Oh I can still taste the last time,  
you and me and nothin' but the tan lines.  
Keeps runnin' through my my mind.  
on and on and on and on and

Baby when I look at you, with them baby blues,  
cuttin' right through me.  
You set me on the rewind, back to the good times,  
when you couldn't get enough of me.  
I guess I givin' myself away.  
Sayin' all the things I never did say.  
I lose myself, there's nothing else I can do.  
Baby, when I look at you.

Yeah, baby when I look at you.

Well I know you know I'm a watchin'.  
Your low cut on the dance floor rockin'.  
Got the whole place worked up and locked in.  
With every move so sexy it's shockin'.  
Girl you sure do know how to serve it.  
The way I did ya Lord I deserve it.  
You know my heart, you know how to hurt it.

on and on and on and on and

Baby when I look at you, with them baby blues,  
cuttin' right through me.  
You set me on the rewind, back to the good times,  
when you couldn't get enough of me.  
I guess I givin' myself away.  
Sayin' all the things I never did say.  
I lose myself, there's nothing else I can do.  
Baby, when I look at you.

Yeah, baby when I look at you

Well, I could start a tab and run it up,  
or close it out and head to my truck, and  
drive away as fast as I can  
and forget we ever bucked.

Baby when I look at you, with them baby blues,  
they're cuttin' right through me.  
You set me on the rewind, back to the good times,  
when you couldn't get enough of me.  
I guess I givin' myself away.  
Sayin' all the things I never did say.  
I lose myself, there's nothing else I can do.  
Oh, I lose myself, there's nothing else I can do.  
Baby, when I look at you.  
Yeah, baby, when I look at you.

Baby when I look at you, with them baby blues,  
They're cuttin' right through me.
