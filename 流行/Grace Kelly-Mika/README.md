**Grace Kelly** 是英国创作歌手、音乐家Mika在2007年初发表的第二首单曲。该曲也曾收录在其专辑《Life in Cartoon
Motion（卡通人生）》中。此曲一经发行，便获得了绝佳的成绩，蝉连英国单曲榜六周冠军，而他令人惊艳的创作风格，使他受到音乐界前所未有的关注，让他获选为英国广播公司（BBC）2007「年度之声」，他也被业界评选为最有前途的新人，短短几月，他从喜爱音乐的平凡小子，摇身一变成为炙手可热的当红新星。

  
而Mika的首张专辑《Life in Cartoon Motion（卡通人生）》也获得巨大的成功，他也开始被外界拿来与其他音乐家比拟，比如Freddie
Mercury，David Bowie，Prince，Robbie Williams，Scissor Sisters，及Elton
John相提并论。事实上，Mika曾在《 _Grace Kelly_
》的歌词中提到皇后乐队主唱：“我想学习优雅的摩纳哥王妃，但她的样子太过悲伤，所以我试着做小Freddie，我想我已经人格混乱了。”
Mika天生的音色和高音唱腔和Freddie颇为相似，他也被评论重现了老牌乐队Queen主唱的经典嗓音。

### Grace Kelly歌词：

I wanna talk to you.  
The last time we talked  
Mr. Smith  
you reduced me to tears.  
I promise you that wont happen again!  
Do I attract you?  
Do I repulse you with my queasy smile?  
Am I too dirty?  
Am I too flirty?  
I could be wholesome  
I could be loathsome  
I guess Im a little bit shy  
Why dont you like me?  
Why dont you like me without making me try?  
I tried to be like Grace Kelly  
But all her looks were too sad  
So I tried a little Freddie  
Ive gone identity mad!  
I could be brown I could be blue  
I could be violet sky  
I could be hurtful I could be purple  
I could be anything you like  
Gotta be green Gotta be mean  
Gotta be everything more  
Why dont you like me? Why dont you like me?  
Why dont you walk out the door!  
Getting angry doesn\'t solve anything.  
How can I help it How can I help it  
How can I help what you think?  
Hello my baby Hello my baby  
Putting my life on the brink  
Why dont you like me Why dont you like me  
Why dont you like yourself?  
Should I bend over?  
Should I look older just to be put on your shelf?  
I tried to be like Grace Kelly  
But all her looks were too sad  
So I tried a little Freddie  
Ive gone identity mad!  
I could be brown I could be blue  
I could be violet sky  
I could be hurtful I could be purple  
I could be anything you like  
Gotta be green Gotta be mean  
Gotta be everything more  
Why dont you like me? Why dont you like me?  
Walk out the door!  
Say what you want to satisfy yourself  
But you only want what everybody else says you should want  
you want  
I could be brown I could be blue  
I could be violet sky  
I could be hurtful I could be purple  
I could be anything you like  
Gotta be green Gotta be mean  
Gotta be everything more  
Walk out the door!  
I could be brown I could be blue  
I could be violet sky  
I could be hurtful I could be purple  
I could be anything you like  
Gotta be green Gotta be mean  
Gotta be everything more  
Why dont you like me? Why dont you like me?  
Why dont you like me? Why dont you like me?  
Walk out the door!
