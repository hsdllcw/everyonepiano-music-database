### One歌词：

Long hours and a few dying flowers  
But you never seem to stick around  
How could you let something so good  
Go to waste and bleed the colours out  
You don't know what you got 'til it's gone  
Know when it's right 'til it's wrong  
In search of perfect when you had it with you all along  
You broke her heart down with ease  
Now I'm picking up every piece  
You must be so hard to please  
I wish I could say  
Thank you for all the mistakes  
Thank you for all of the pain  
I guess somebody else's loss is another's gain  
I'm saying thank you to the one who let her get away  
Away  
She gave you love but it wasn't enough  
You had your mind set out on other things  
Can't sleep at night now you're paying the price  
You let another come and take your place  
You don't know what you got till it's gone  
Know when it's right till it's wrong  
In search of perfect when you had it with you all along  
You broke your heart down with ease  
Now I'm picking up every piece  
You must be so hard to please  
I wish I could say  
Thank you for all the mistakes  
Thank you for all of the pain  
I guess somebody else's loss is another's gain  
I'm saying thank you to the one who let her get away  
Away  
Thank you to the one who caused her heart to break  
I'm thanking you for giving me a soul to save  
Thank you to the one who let her get away  
You know I wish I could say  
Thank you for all the mistakes  
Thank you for all of the pain  
I guess somebody else's loss is another's  
So I wish I could say  
Thank you for all the mistakes  
Thank you for all of the pain  
I guess somebody else's loss is another's gain  
I'm saying thank you to the one who let her get away  
Away
