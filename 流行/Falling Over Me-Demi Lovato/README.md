### Falling Over Me歌词：

I'm standing in the center of the room  
I watch the boys follow girl's perfume  
All is as it should be I assume  
Except for the distance between me and you

You're standing as a flower on the wall  
The room is still but we're about to fall  
And all the names that brought us here  
Simply fade away.....

Who you are is falling over me  
(Who you are is falling over me)  
Who you are is everything I need  
(Who you are is everything I need)

I'm hoping  
I'm waiting  
I'm praying you are the one  
I'm hoping  
I'm waiting  
I'm praying you are the one

I can't believe that night turned into today  
I used the line you were supposed to say  
And all the names that brought us here  
Now we have to thank

Who you are is falling over me  
(Who you are is falling over me)  
Who you are has got me on my knees  
(Who you are has got me on my knees)

I'm hoping  
I'm waitng  
I'm praying you are the one

If you are I will wait I will follow  
I'm here to stay  
As long as we're promised tomorrow  
I promise you today I'll wait  
I'll wait  
Who you are is falling over me  
(Who you are is falling over me)  
Who you are has got me on my knees  
(Who you are has got me on my knees)

I'm hoping  
I'm waiting  
I'm praying you are the one  
I'm hoping  
I'm waiting  
I'm praying you are the one

You are the one
