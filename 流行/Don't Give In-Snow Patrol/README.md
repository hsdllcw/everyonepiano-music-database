Don't give in  
别轻言放弃  
Don't you dare quit so easy  
你不会轻易妥协  
Give all that you got on the soul  
倾注你所有的灵魂  
Don't say that you want it forever  
你曾说过你想永远得到这一切  
I know, I know  
我理解  
It's in your blood  
满腔热血  
And it's in your making  
摩拳擦掌  
So don't hold your tongue  
别再缄默不言  
'Cause it's, it's no longer working  
因为机会转瞬即逝  
Don't fall on your sword  
别独自承受后果  
Just follow your instinct  
相信你的直觉  
Like an old lesson learned  
像是接受古训  
Like an old lesson learned  
接受古训  
Only you know what it, what it is to see through  
只有你知道 洞察真相  
See through the eyes that are trained on me now  
透过你的眼眸 我知道你学有所成  
I can, I can only tell you how it, how it looks from here  
我只能从我的角度  
I think you made up your mind  
知道你思想成熟  
I think you made up your mind  
羽化成蝶

Yes there's a lot we can  
是的 我们进步空间还很大  
We can learn from this loss  
我们将取长补短  
Learn not to let it fall around our ears  
学会不被周围的闲言碎语击垮  
Don't fall in love with the, with the way things were  
经得起眼前的诱惑  
It'll fuck up your mind, it'll fuck up your mind  
它将干扰的思绪 扰乱你的思维  
For this is all on the wings of others  
别人也会乘人之危，趁机领先  
I loved you more  
我更爱你  
More in your own flight  
独立自主  
So it ain't the same  
特立独行  
It won't be lost forever

And I don't know why, and I don't know why
