### 白色圣诞White Christmas歌词：

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas

Just like the ones I used to know

Where the treetop's glisten,

And children listen

To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas

With every Christmas card I write

May your days be merry and bright

And may all your Christmases be white

The sun is shining

The grass is green

The orange and palm trees sway

I've never seen such a day

In beautiful old LA

But it's December the 24th

And I am longing to be up north

Merry Christmas, everybody!

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas

Just like the ones I used to know

Where the treetop's glisten,

And children listen

To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas

With every Christmas card I write

May your days be merry and bright

And may all your Christmases be white

May your days be merry and bright

And may all your Christmases be white
