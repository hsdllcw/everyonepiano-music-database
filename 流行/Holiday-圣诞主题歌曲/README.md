### Holiday歌词：

T-T-Tay Keith Took it to ten  
Hey  
Ayy it's a holiday  
I got h*es on h*es and they outta control yeah  
Ayy it's another way  
All my n***as on go and I hope that you know it  
I can't even close my eyes  
And I don't know why guess I don't like surprises  
I can't even stay away from the game that I play  
They gon' know us today yeah  
Ayy can I pop s**t  
I might bottom on the low but I top s**t  
Switch the genre on you h*es do a rock hit  
I got the biggest d**n song f**k the charts sis  
I don't need 'em  
They wanna know if I be lastin'  
B***h even if I started floppin' that'd be fashion  
Poppin' up in movies ain't no Nasy b***h it's Ashton  
Hee hee I'm bad as Michael Jackson  
Dun dun dun  
Ayy it's a holiday  
I got h*es on h*es and they outta control yeah  
Ayy it's another way  
All my n***as on go and I hope that you know it  
I can't even close my eyes  
And I don't know why guess I don't like surprises  
I can't even stay away from the game that I play  
They gon' know us today yeah  
Man I snuck into the game came in on a horse  
I pulled the gimmick I admit it I got no remorse  
Nobody tried to let me in nobody opened doors  
I kicked them motherf**kers down they didn't have a choice  
Dun-dun-dun  
They tried to next me hey boy no blessy  
And you know I flex but my checks give 'em Vettes  
Ayy and I'm sexy they wanna s*x me  
Pop star but the rappers still respect me  
They wanna know if I be lastin'  
B***h even if I started floppin' that'd be fashion  
Poppin' up in movies ain't no Nasy b***h it's Ashton  
Hee hee I'm bad as Michael Jackson  
Dun dun dun  
Ayy it's a holiday  
I got h*es on h*es and they outta control yeah  
Ayy it's another way  
All my n***as on go and I hope that you know it  
I can't even close my eyes  
And I don't know why guess I don't like surprises  
I can't even stay away from the game that I play  
They gon' know us today yeah
