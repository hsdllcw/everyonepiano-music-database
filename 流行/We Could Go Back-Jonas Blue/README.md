### We Could Go Back歌词：

Should have could have would have but it's too late  
Shouldn't catch feelings on a first date  
0 to 100 no first base  
Ended up with coffee back at your place  
Every night is keeping me awake  
I keep thinking about all the things I would change  
If I could go back  
Tell me would you even would you still believe in  
And if we could turn back  
Tell me would you even would you still believe in me  
But it's no race  
Never a time to find our own pace  
Trying to drive feelings that won't go away  
Sleep in the bed of my own mistakes  
Every night is keeping me awake  
I keep thinking about all the things I would change  
If I could go back  
Tell me would you even would you still believe in  
We could turn back  
Tell me would you even would you still believe in me  
I know time waits for no man  
I'm standing here now with no plans  
Let's go baby  
Go go baby  
I know time waits for no man  
I'm standing here now with no plans  
Let's go baby  
Go go baby  
If I could go back  
Tell me would you even would you still believe in  
And if we could turn back if we could come back  
Tell me would you even would you still believe in me  
Tell me would you still believe in me  
Tell me would you still believe
