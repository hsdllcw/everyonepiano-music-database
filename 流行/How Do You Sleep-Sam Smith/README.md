### How Do You Sleep歌词：

I'm done hating myself for feeling  
I'm done crying myself awake  
I've gotta leave and start the healing  
But when you move like that I just want to stay  
What have I become  
Looking at your phone oh no  
Love to you is just a game  
Look what I have done  
Dialing up the numbers on you  
I don't want my heart to break  
Baby how do you sleep when you lie to me  
All that shame and all that danger  
I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight  
Baby how do you sleep when you lie to me  
All that fear and all that pressure  
I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight  
Tell me how do you  
Love will keep you up tonight  
Tell me how do you  
Oh no how did I manage to lose me  
I am not this desperate not this crazy  
There's no way I'm sticking around to find out  
I won't lose like that I won't lose myself  
Look what I have done  
Dialing up the numbers on you  
I don't want my heart to break  
Baby how do you sleep when you lie to me  
All that shame and all that danger  
I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight  
Baby how do you sleep when you lie to me  
All that fear and all that pressure  
I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight  
Tell me how do you  
Love will keep you up tonight  
Tell me how do you  
Love will keep you up tonight  
Baby how do you sleep when you lie to me  
All that shame and all that danger  
I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight  
Baby how do you sleep when you lie to me  
All that fear and all that pressure  
I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight  
Tell me how do you
