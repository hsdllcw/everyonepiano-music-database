### That Funny Feeling歌词：

I can't really, uh, play the guitar very well or sing, so uh, apologies  
Stunning 8K-resolution meditation app  
In honor of the revolution, it's half-off at the Gap  
Deadpool, self-awareness, loving parents, harmless fun  
The backlash to the backlash to the thing that's just begun  
There it is again  
That funny feeling  
That funny feeling  
There it is again  
That funny feeling  
That funny feeling  
The surgeon general's pop-up shop, Robert Iger's face  
Discount Etsy agitprop, Bugles' take on race  
Female Colonel Sanders, easy answers, civil war  
The whole world at your fingertips, the ocean at your door  
The live-action Lion King, the Pepsi Halftime Show  
Twenty-thousand years of this; seven more to go  
Carpool Karaoke, Steve Aoki, Logan Paul  
A gift shop at the gun range, a mass shooting at the mall  
There it is again  
That funny feeling  
That funny feeling  
There it is again  
That funny feeling  
That funny feeling  
Reading Pornhub's terms of service, going for a drive  
And obeying all the traffic laws in Grand Theft Auto V  
Full agoraphobic, losing focus, cover blown  
A book on getting better hand-delivered by a drone  
Total disassociation, fully out your mind  
Googling derealization, hating what you find  
That unapparent summer air in early fall  
The quiet comprehending of the ending of it all  
There it is again  
That funny feeling  
That funny feeling  
There it is again  
That funny feeling  
That funny feeling  
Hey, what can you say?  
We were overdue  
But it'll be over soon  
You wait  
Hey, what can you say?  
We were overdue  
But it'll be over soon  
Just wait  
Hey, what can you say?  
We were overdue  
But it'll be over soon  
You wait  
Hey, what can you say?  
We were overdue  
But it'll be over soon  
You wait  
Hey, what can you say?  
We were overdue  
But it'll be over soon  
You wait
