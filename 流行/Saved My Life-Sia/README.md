### Saved My Life歌词：

Boom boom boom  
Beats my heart heart heart  
Baby boom boom boom  
In the dark dark dark  
Baby boom boom boom  
Fall apart part part  
Baby boom boom boom  
From the start start start  
But I've been waiting for you  
I've been waiting for you  
I've been waiting for you  
I've been waiting for you  
I've been waiting for you  
I've been waiting for you  
I've been waiting for you  
Yeah I've been waiting for you  
Well someone must have sent you here to save my life  
Someone must have sent you to save me tonight  
I know that in darkness I have found my light  
I know that in darkness I've been given sight  
In your loving arms I feel delight  
In your loving arms I'll be alright  
Someone must have sent you to save me tonight  
Someone must have sent you here to save my life  
Save my life  
Save my life  
Save my life  
Save my life  
Save my life  
Save my life  
Save my life  
Save my life  
High high high we take flight flight flight  
Baby high high high  
Touch the sky sky sky  
Baby high high high  
Diamond nights nights nights  
Baby high high high  
'Cause love don't lie lie lie  
I've been waiting for you  
I've been waiting for you  
I've been waiting for you  
I've been waiting for you  
I've been waiting for you  
I've been waiting for you  
I've been waiting for you  
I've been waiting for you  
Well someone must have sent you here to save my life  
Someone must have sent you to save me tonight  
I know that in darkness I have found my light  
I know that in darkness I've been given sight  
In your loving arms I feel delight  
In your loving arms I'll be alright  
Someone must have sent you to save me tonight  
Someone must have sent you here to save my life  
Save my life  
Save my life  
Save my life  
Save my life  
Save my life  
Save my life  
Save my life  
Save my life  
Save my life  
Save my life  
Save my life  
Save my life  
Save my life  
Save my life  
Save my life  
You saved my life
