### Mandy歌词：

I remember all my life  
raining down as cold as ice.  
Shadows of a man  
a face through a window cryin' in the night  
the night goes into  
Morning just another day  
happy people pass my way  
Looking in their eyes  
I see a memory I never realized  
how happy you made me.  
Oh Mandy well  
you came and you gave without taking  
but I sent you away.  
Oh Mandy  
well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking  
and I need you today. Oh Mandy!  
I'm standing on the edge of time  
I've walked away when love was mine.  
Caught up in a world of uphill climbing  
the tears are in my mind  
and nothin' in rhyming.  
Oh Mandy well  
you came and you gave without taking  
but I sent you away.  
Oh Mandy well  
you kissed me and stopped me from shaking  
and I need you today. Oh Mandy!

Yestoday's a dream I face the Molin  
Cry'in our breath  
The pay's callin'  
Oh Mandy well  
you came and you gave without taking  
but I sent you away.  
Oh Mandy well  
you kissed me and stopped me from shaking  
and I need you today. Oh Mandy!  
you came and you gave without taking  
but I sent you away.  
Oh Mandy  
you kissed me and stopped me from shaking  
and I need you
