《 **In the Stars** 》是美国创作型歌手Benson
Boone演唱的歌曲。凭借高亢的嗓声和坚定诚实的歌词，此曲发行首周就空降单曲榜第21位。

Benson Boone此前凭借一曲《Ghost
Town》崭露头角甚至取得了北欧一国的冠单，如今时隔数月终于带来了自己的第二首正式单曲，果不其然得到更高的关注度并最终反馈在初动空降名次上。

《 _In the Stars_
》封面好像是一只手向宇宙深处抓去，仿佛想触摸遥不可及的星辰，又像是五指在黑夜中化为光点散为星空一片。我们可以从一声又一声“I'm still
holding”听出他的挣扎，我们互相仰望，我们自成宇宙。

### In the Stars歌词：

Sunday mornings were your favorite  
I used to meet you down on Woods Creek Road  
You did your hair up like you were famous  
Even though it's only church where we were going  
Now Sunday mornings I just sleep in  
It's like I've buried my faith with you  
I'm screaming at a God I don't know if I believe in  
'Cause I don't know what else I can do  
I'm still holding on to everything that's dead and gone  
I don't wanna say goodbye 'cause this one means forever  
Now you're in the stars and six-feet's never felt so far  
Here I am alone between the heavens and the embers  
Oh it hurts so hard for a million different reasons  
You took the best of my heart and left the rest in pieces  
Digging through your old birthday letters  
A crumpled twenty still in the box  
I don't think that I could ever find a way to spend it  
Even if it's the last twenty that I've got  
Oh I'm still holding on to everything that's dead and gone  
I don't wanna say goodbye 'cause this one means forever  
Now you're in the stars and six-feet's never felt so far  
Here I am alone between the heavens and the embers  
Oh it hurts so hard for a million different reasons  
You took the best of my heart and left the rest in pieces  
I'm still holding  
On  
Holding  
On  
Holding on  
I'm still holding  
On  
Holding  
On  
Holding on  
I'm still holding  
On  
Holding  
On  
I'm still holding on  
I'm still holding ooh still holding on  
I'm still holding on to everything that's dead and gone  
I don't wanna say goodbye 'cause this one means forever  
Now you're in the stars and six-feet's never felt so far  
Here I am alone between the heavens and the embers  
Oh it hurts so hard for a million different reasons  
You took the best of my heart and left the rest in pieces
