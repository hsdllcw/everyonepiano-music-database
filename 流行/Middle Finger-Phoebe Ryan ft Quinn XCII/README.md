### Middle Finger歌词：

Phoebe Ryan：  
What I offer is something rare  
If your heart's changing then that's not fair  
You might hate this but I don't care  
I don't care  
I'm acting up 'cause you don't listen to me  
Quinn XCII：  
What I give you is something real  
I thought that my heart was yours to steal  
You're so absent like what's the deal  
Hopefully you're acting up 'cause you can't live without me  
Both：  
When it comes through  
I see it always leads to one thing  
But I need something more than your time  
Yeah I love me some love and affection  
I'm so tired of being stressed and polite  
I don't wanna waste another moment with us apart  
Baby this should be simple  
Loving me is not that hard  
You're always on my agenda  
You've been on it from the start  
But when you act like it's nothing  
It's a middle finger to my heart  
Quinn XCII：  
I think it's crazy I know this is wrong  
But I can't stop you from doing what you want  
Phoebe Ryan：  
You're so amazing  
Before you're gone just tell me  
Are you coming back to us eventually  
Both：  
When it comes through  
I see it always leads to one thing  
But I need something more than your time  
Yeah I love me some love and affection  
I'm so tired of being stressed and polite  
I don't wanna waste another moment with us apart  
Baby this should be simple  
Loving me's not that hard  
You're always on my agenda  
You've been on it from the start  
But when you act like it's nothing  
It's a middle finger to my heart  
It's a middle finger to my  
Middle finger to my heart  
Middle finger to my heart  
When you act like it's nothing  
Middle finger to my heart  
It's a middle finger to my  
Middle finger to my heart  
It's a middle finger to my  
Phoebe Ryan：  
My heart is in your hands for a reason  
Don't act like it's nothing yeah  
I'm giving you my all but you don't see it  
You act like it's nothing  
Cause I don't wanna waste another moment with us apart  
Both：  
Baby this should be simple  
Phoebe Ryan：  
Loving me is not that hard  
Both：  
You're always on my agenda  
Phoebe Ryan：  
You've been on it from the start  
But when you act like it's nothing  
Both：  
I don't wanna waste another moment with us apart  
Baby this should be simple  
Loving me is not that hard  
You're always on my agenda  
You've been on it from the start  
But when you act like it's nothing  
It's a middle finger to my heart  
It's a middle finger to my  
Middle finger to my heart yeah yeah  
Middle finger to my heart  
When you act like it's nothing  
Middle finger to my heart  
It's a middle finger to my  
Middle finger to my heart  
It's a middle finger to my
