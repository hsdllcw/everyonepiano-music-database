**Get Well Soon** 由美国女歌手Ariana Grande演唱。

这首歌是为了纪念2017年曼城爆炸袭击事件中的受难者，从歌名Get Well Soon到歌曲中不断重复着的“You Can Feel It Feel
It”都体现了Ariana直面曾受过的磨难。化身天使般的歌喉虽充满着含蓄的忧郁，却让这种真诚的方式揭开最真实的自我，从而散发着对未来的美好。

正是这种高度私人化的情绪，使她对于自身风格更具有一种探索性。歌曲由多重和声重叠，人声在不断穿梭的空间粒子感中如一丝微风从人耳到达心头。经典的Soul范式在她的演绎下富有层次感，犹如一剂良药抚慰了人们的心灵。

### Get Well Soon歌词：

You can feel it feel it  
Yeah yeah  
They say my system is overloaded  
Girl what's wrong with you  
Come back down  
I'm too much in my head  
Did you notice  
Girl what's wrong with you  
Come back down  
My body's here on Earth  
But I'm floating  
Girl what's wrong with you  
Come back down  
Disconnected so sometimes  
I feel frozen and alone  
This is for everybody  
Babe you gotta take care of your body yuh yuh  
Ain't no time to deny it  
That is why we talking about it  
Yeah we talking about it  
To deal with it don't try to get by it  
Ain't no time to deny it  
So we had to sit down and just write it  
Want you to get better  
My life is so controlled by the what-ifs  
Girl what's wrong with you  
Come back down  
Is there anybody else whose mind does this mmm  
Girl what's wrong with you  
Come back down  
Down down down down  
Is there such a ladder to get above this  
Down down down down down down down down  
Girl what's wrong with you  
Come back down  
Maybe I should ground myself where the mud is  
Before I'm gone  
This is for everybody  
Babe you gotta take care of your body yuh yuh  
Ain't no time to deny it  
That is why we talking about it  
Yeah we talking about it  
To deal with it don't try to get by it  
Ain't no time to deny it  
So we had to sit down and just write it  
You can work your way to the top  
You can feel it feel it woo  
Just know that there's up and downs and there's drops  
You can feel it feel it woo  
Unfollow fear and just say "You are blocked"  
You can feel it feel it yuh  
Just know there is so much room at the top  
You can feel it feel it yuh  
Well here's one thing you can trust yuh  
It take you and me to make us  
One of those days you had enough  
I'll be there yuh yuh yuh  
If it ain't one thing it's another  
When you need someone to pull you out the bubble  
I'll be right there just to hug you  
I'll be there  
Where are you  
Are you home  
Call me right on the phone  
I'll be there yeah  
I'll be there  
I don't care who is gone  
You shouldn't be alone  
I'll be there there  
You can work your way to the top  
You can feel it feel it woo  
I'm with you I'm with you  
I'm with you just call me  
I'm with you I'm with you  
Just know that there's up and downs and there's drops  
You can feel it feel it babe  
I'm with you I'm with you  
I'm with you just call me  
I'm with you I'm with you  
Unfollow fear and just say "You are blocked"  
You can feel it feel it yuh  
I'm with you I'm with you  
I'm with you just call me  
I'm with you I'm with you  
Just know there is so much room at the top  
You can feel it feel it yeh  
I'm with you I'm with you  
I'm with you just call me  
No matter the issue  
No matter what uh uh uh  
Here's one thing you can trust yuh  
It takes you and me to make us  
One of those days you had enough  
I'll be there I'll be there  
'Cause if it ain't one thing it's another  
When you need someone to pull you out the bubble  
I'll be right there just to hug you  
I'll be there

Call me right on the phone  
I'll be there yeah I'll be there
