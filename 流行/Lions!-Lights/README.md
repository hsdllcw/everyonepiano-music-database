Lions!歌词：

give me a disaster, give me an emergency  
stand me at the head of the crusade without a remedy  
show me to the shipwreck, show me how you're bones shake  
and when i'm at the edge of sorrow's blade,  
show me how a heart breakes  
be steady on your feet  
no matter the trouble you meet  
lions make you brave  
giants give you faith  
death is a charade  
you don't have to feel safe to feel unafraid  
find me at the bottom looking at the vultures  
standing in the heart of the disease,  
following the hard curves  
i'm looking for the thunder, i'm looking for the blacknes  
i'm learning how to get up off my knees and all takes is practice  
be ready on your feet  
no matter the trouble you meet  
lions make you brave  
giants give you faith  
death is a charade  
you don't have to feel safe to feel unafraid  
i'm not the hunter, i'm not the marked  
just looking for wisdom in the dark  
lions make you brave  
giants give you faith  
death is a charade  
you don't have to feel safe to feel unafraid  
lions make you brave  
giants give you faith  
death is a charade  
you don't have to feel safe to feel unafraid  
you don't have to feel safe to feel unafraid
