### Needy歌词：

If you take too long to hit me back  
I can't promise you how I'll react  
But all I can say  
Is at least I'll wait for you  
Lately I've been on a roller coaster  
Tryna get a hold of my emotions  
But all that I know is I need you close  
And I'ma scream and shout for what I love  
Passionate but I don't give no f**ks  
I admit that I'm a lil' messed up  
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up  
I'm obsessive and I love too hard  
Good at overthinking with my heart  
How you even think it got this far  
This far  
And I can be needy way too d**n needy  
I can be needy tell me how good it feels to be needed  
I can be needy so hard to please me  
I know it feels so good to be needed  
Sorry if I'm up and down a lot yeah  
Sorry that I think I'm not enough  
And sorry if I say sorry way too much  
You can go ahead and call me selfish selfish  
But after all this damage I can't help it help it  
But what you can trust is I need your touch  
I'ma scream and shout for what I love  
Passionate but I don't give no f**ks  
I admit that I'm a lil' messed up  
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up  
I'm obsessive and I love too hard  
Good at overthinking with my heart  
How you even think it got this far  
This far  
And I can be needy way too d**n needy  
I can be needy tell me how good it feels to be needed  
I can be needy so hard to please me  
I know it feels so good to be needed
