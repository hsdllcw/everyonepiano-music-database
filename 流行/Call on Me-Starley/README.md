### Call on Me歌词：

When you're low  
And your knees can't rise  
You feel helpless  
And you're looking to the sky  
Some people would say  
To accept their fate  
Well, if this is fate  
Then we'll find a way to cheat

Cause, oh, oh, oh, oh we'll say a little prayer  
But, oh, oh, oh, oh if the answer isn't fair

You know you can call on me  
When you need somebody  
You know you can call on me  
When you can't stop the tears from falling down, down, down  
You know you can call on me  
Call on me, darling  
You know you can call on me  
Call on me, darling (Call on me)

When you're weary  
And the road is dark  
And I'll guide you  
With the beating of my heart  
And if the calvary  
And the help don't come  
Well, then we'll find a way  
To dodge a smoking gun

Cause, oh, oh, oh, oh we'll say a little prayer  
But, oh, oh, oh, oh if the answer isn't fair (then call on me)

You know you can call on me  
When you need somebody  
You know you can call on me  
When you can't stop the tears from falling down, down, down  
You know you can call on me  
Call on me, darling  
You know you can call on me  
Call on me, darling (call on me)

When you're, you need someone (Just call on me)  
You need somebody to cling to (Call on me)  
When you're, you need someone (Just call on me)  
You need somebody to dry your tears  
When you're, you need someone (You can call me)  
You need somebody to cling to (Just call on me)

Just call on me, love (Just call on me)  
Just call on me, love (Call on me)  
Just call on me, love (Just call on me)  
Just call on me, love (Call on me)  
Just call on me, love, on me
