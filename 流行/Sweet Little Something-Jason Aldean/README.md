### Sweet Little Somethin'歌词：

Just what I had in mind  
Thinking about the weekend  
Standing by the Yeti with the party lights plugged in  
Got a jug of feel good, going around  
There's just one thing missing, baby, right about now

I need a sweet little somethin' like you got  
Standing there red hot, tied up little tank top  
Looking like you must be straight out of the country  
Honey, what I wouldn't do for a sweet little somethin' like you

I see you dancing over there with your girlfriends  
Got your fine self showing off that sun tan  
You keep smiling that smile at me  
Like you're reading my mind, and you know...

I need a sweet little somethin' like you got  
Standing there red hot, tied up little tank top  
Looking like you must be straight out of the country  
Honey, what I wouldn't do for a sweet little somethin' like you

I need a sweet little somethin' like you, girl,  
Sliding into my world  
Yeah, I've been needing it all night  
Slow kinda just right,  
Honey suckle sweet little somethin'

I need a sweet little somethin' like you got  
Standing there red hot, tied up little tank top  
Looking like you must be straight out of the country  
Honey, what I wouldn't do for a sweet little somethin'

Sweet little somethin' like you got  
Standing there red hot, tied up little tank top  
Looking like you must be straight out of the country  
Honey, what I wouldn't do for a sweet little somethin' like you

I wanna ride you round in my old truck  
Keep you out until the sun comes up  
Girl, you got some serious  
Sweet little somethin' like you

The way you slide that across the seat  
Looking so damn good to me  
Hey little girl right now  
I need a sweet little somethin' like

I wanna ride you round in my old truck  
Keep you out until the sun comes up  
Girl, you got some serious  
Sweet little somethin' like you

The way you slide that across the seat  
Looking so damn good to me  
Hey little girl right now  
I need a sweet little somethin' like you
