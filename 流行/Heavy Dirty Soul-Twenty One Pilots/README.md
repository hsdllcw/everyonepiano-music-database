### Heavy Dirty Soul歌词：

There's an infestation in my mind's imagination,  
I hope that they choke on smoke 'cause I'm smoking them out the basement,  
This is not rap, this is not hip-hop,  
Just another attempt to make the voices stop,  
Rapping to prove nothing, just writing to say something,  
'Cause I wasn't the only one who wasn't rushing to sayin' nothing,  
This doesn't mean I lost my dream,  
It's just right now I got a really crazy mind to clean.

Gangsters don't cry,  
Therefore, therefore I'm,  
Mr. Misty-eyed, therefore I'm.

Can you save, can you save my—  
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?  
Can you save, can you save my—  
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?  
For me, for me, uh  
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?  
For me, for me, uh  
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?

Nah, I didn't understand a thing you said,  
If I didn't know better I'd guess you're all already dead,  
Mindless zombies walking around with a limp and a hunch,  
Saying stuff like, "You only live once."  
You've got one time to figure it out,  
One time to twist and one time to shout,  
One time to think and I say we start now,  
Sing it with me if you know what I'm talking about.

Gangsters don't cry,  
Therefore, therefore I'm,  
Mr. Misty-eyed, therefore I'm.

Can you save, can you save my—  
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?  
Can you save, can you save my—  
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?  
For me, for me, uh  
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?  
For me, for me, uh  
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?

Death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit. [2x]

Can you save, can you save my—  
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?  
Can you save, can you save my—  
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?  
For me, for me, uh  
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?  
For me, for me, uh  
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?

Can you save, can you save my—save my—  
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?  
Can you save, can you save my—save my—  
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
