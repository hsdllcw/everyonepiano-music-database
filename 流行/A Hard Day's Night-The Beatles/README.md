### A Hard Day's Night歌词：

It's been a hard day's night  
And I've been working like a dog.  
It's been a hard day's night,  
I should be sleeping like a log.  
But when I get home to you,  
I find the things that you do  
Will make me feel alright.  
You know I work all day  
To get you money to buy you things.  
And it's worth it just to here you say,  
You're gonna give me everything.  
So why on earth should I moan,  
'Cos when I get you alone  
You know I feel okay.  
When I'm home everything seems to be right.  
When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah.  
It's been a hard day's night  
And I've been working like a dog.  
It's been a hard day's night,  
I should be sleeping like a log.  
But when I get home to you,  
I find the things that you do  
Will make me feel alright.  
So why on earth should I moan,  
'Cos when I get you alone  
You know I feel okay.  
When I'm home everything seems to be right.  
When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah.  
It's been a hard day's night  
And I've been working like a dog.  
It's been a hard day's night,  
I should be sleeping like a log.  
But when I get home to you,  
I find the things that you do  
Will make me feel alright.  
You know I feel alright,  
You know I feel alright.
