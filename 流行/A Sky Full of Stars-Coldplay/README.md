### A Sky Full of Stars歌词：

Cause you're a sky, cause you're a sky full of stars  
I'm gonna give you my heart  
Cause you're a sky, cause you're a sky full of stars  
Cause you light up the path  
And I don't care, go on and tear me apart  
I don't care if you do  
Cause in a sky, cause in a sky full of stars  
I think I saw you  
Cause you're a sky, cause you're a sky full of stars  
I want to die in your arms  
Cause you get lighter the more it gets dark  
I'm gonna give you my heart  
And I don't care, go on and tear me apart  
And I don't care if you do  
Cause in a sky, cause in a sky full of stars  
I think I see you  
I think I see you  
Because you're a sky, you're a sky full of stars  
Such a Heavenly view  
You're such a Heavenly view  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Woo!
