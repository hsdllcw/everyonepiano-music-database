### Always Been You歌词：

It's a fairytale I can't explain  
Full of words I don't know how to say  
And without a little twist of fate  
I know I'd still be searching baby  
I swear that you've been sent to save me  
You're the only one that my heart keeps coming back to  
It's always been you it's always been you  
It's always been you it's always been you  
It's always been you  
And you've seen all my darkest fears  
Like you've known me for a thousand years  
The boy who's really underneath  
All the scars and insecurities baby  
I swear that you've been sent to save me  
You're the only one that my heart keeps coming back to  
It's always been you it's always been you  
It's always been you it's always been you  
It's always been you  
You're the only one that my heart keeps coming back to  
It's always been you yeah  
It's always been you  
You're the only one that my heart keeps coming back to
