### Teach Me How to Love歌词：

Ooh, your body's like an ocean  
I'm devoted  
To explore you  
Ooh, what do you desire  
I'm inspired  
I'll do it for you  
Won't you draw a map for me  
Laced with strawberries  
And I'll get on my knees  
Put my hands around you  
Ooh, teach me how to  
Touch you, tease, caress you and please you  
Teach me how to love  
Put my hands around you  
Ooh, teach me how to  
Touch you, tease, caress you and please you  
Teach me, teach me, teach me how to love  
Your imagination  
Now I'm fixated  
And I'm dying to learn  
Every inch of you, there's something new  
F'ing me up  
I'm what you deserve  
Just draw a map for me  
Laced with strawberries  
And I'll get on my knees  
Put my hands around you  
Ooh, teach me how to  
Touch you, tease, caress you and please you  
Teach me how to love  
Put my hands around you  
Ooh, teach me how to  
Touch you, tease, caress you and please you  
Teach me, teach me, teach me how to love  
How to love  
How to love  
Teach me, teach me, teach me how to love  
Teach me, teach me, teach me how to love  
Babe, I won't stop till you feel the rush  
Babe, I won't stop till you feel the rush  
Babe, I won't stop till you feel the rush  
Teach me, teach me, teach me how to love  
Babe, I won't stop till you feel the rush  
Babe, I won't stop till you feel the rush  
Babe, I won't stop till you feel the rush  
Put my hands around you  
Ooh, teach me how to  
Touch you, tease, caress you and please you  
Teach me how to love  
Put my hands around you  
Ooh, teach me how to  
Touch you, tease, caress you and please you  
Teach me, teach me, teach me how to love  
How to love  
How to love  
Teach me, teach me, teach me how to love  
How to love  
How to love  
Teach me, teach me, teach me how to love  
Babe, I won't stop till you feel the rush  
Babe, I won't stop till you feel the rush  
Babe, I won't stop till you feel the rush  
Teach me, teach me, teach me how to love  
Babe, I won't stop till you feel the rush  
Babe, I won't stop till you feel the rush  
Babe, I won't stop till you feel the rush  
Teach me, teach me, teach me how to love
