### Afire Love歌词：

Things were all good yesterday  
And then the devil took your memory  
And if you fell to your death today  
I hope that heaven is your resting place  
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain  
But then that could've been the medicine  
And now you're lying in the bed again  
Either way I'll cry with the rest of them

And my father told me, son  
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face  
And you're not the only one  
Although my grandma used to say  
That he used to sing.

Darling, hold me in your arms the way you did last night  
And we'll lie in sight for a little while, he wrote  
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up  
And we're wrapped in light, in life, in love  
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut  
For they're designed to be together, oh  
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one  
And we're set alight, we're afire love

Things were all good yesterday  
But then the devil took your breath away  
And now we're left here in the pain  
Black suit, black tie, standing in the rain  
And now my family is one again  
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend  
Came to my mind, I should paint it with a pen  
Six years old, I remember when

My father told me, son  
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face  
And you're not the only one  
Although my grandma used to say  
He used to sing.

Darling, hold me in your arms the way you did last night  
And we'll lie in sight for a little while, he wrote  
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up  
And we're wrapped in light, in life, in love  
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut  
For they're designed to be together, oh  
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one  
And we're set alight, we're afire in love

To the love we love to love we love [3x]

And my father and all of my family rise from their seats to sing hallelujah  
And my mother and all of my family rise from their seats to sing hallelujah  
And my brother and all of my family rise from their seats to sing hallelujah  
(And all of my brothers and my sisters, yeah)  
And my father and all of my family rise from their seats to sing hallelujah  
To the love we love to love we love [3x]
