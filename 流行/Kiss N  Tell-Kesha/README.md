### Kiss N Tell 歌词：

Listen to yourself, you're a hot mess  
St-st-stutter through your words, breaking a sweat  
What's it gonna take to confess?  
We both know

Yeah, I was outta town last weekend  
You were feeling like a pimp 'round your lame friends  
Now your little party's gonna end  
So here we go

Whoa, you got a secret  
Whoa, you couldn't keep it  
Whoa, somebody leaked it  
And now some shit's about to go down

I never thought that you would be the one  
Acting like a slut when I was gone  
Maybe you shouldn't, oh  
Kiss 'n' tell

You really should've kept it in your pants  
I'm hearing dirty stories from your friends  
Maybe you shouldn't, oh  
Kiss 'n' tell

You're looking like a tool not a baller  
You're acting like a chick, why bother?  
I can find someone way hotter  
With a bigger, wow, well

'Cause I'm talkin' 'bout all the ways that you've messed up  
You weren't smart enough to keep your stupid mouth shut  
I'm so sick of it, I've had enough  
I hope you cry

Whoa, you got a secret  
Whoa, you couldn't keep it  
Whoa, somebody leaked it  
And now some shit's about to go down

I never thought that you would be the one  
Acting like a slut when I was gone  
Maybe you shouldn't, oh  
Kiss 'n' tell

You really should've kept it in your pants  
I'm hearing dirty stories from your friends  
Maybe you shouldn't, oh  
Kiss 'n' tell

Kiss 'n' tell, kiss 'n' tell  
Kiss 'n' tell, kiss 'n' tell  
Kiss 'n' tell, kiss 'n' tell  
Kiss 'n' tell, kiss 'n' tell

Oh, I hope you know you gotta go  
Yo, get up and go, I don't wanna know  
How or why you're gross, you gotta go  
Yo, get up and go 'cause I don't wanna know

I never thought that you would be the one  
Acting like a slut when I was gone  
Maybe you shouldn't, oh  
Kiss 'n' tell

You really should've kept it in your pants  
I'm hearing dirty stories from your friends  
Maybe you shouldn't, oh  
Kiss 'n' tell

Maybe you shouldn't, oh  
Kiss 'n' tell
