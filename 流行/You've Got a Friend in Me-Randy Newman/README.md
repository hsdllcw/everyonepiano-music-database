### You've Got a Friend in Me歌词：

You've got a friend in me  
You've got a friend in me  
When the road looks rough ahead  
And you're miles and miles  
From your nice warm bed  
You just remember what your old pal said  
Boy you've got a friend in me  
Yeah you've got a friend in me  
You've got a friend in me  
You've got a friend in me  
You got troubles and I got 'em too  
There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you  
We stick together we can see it through  
'Cause you've got a friend in me  
You've got a friend in me  
Some other folks might be  
A little bit smarter than I am  
Bigger and stronger too  
Maybe  
But none of them  
Will ever love you the way I do  
It's me and you boy  
And as the years go by  
Our friendship will never die  
You're gonna see it's our destiny  
You've got a friend in me  
You've got a friend in me  
You've got a friend in me
