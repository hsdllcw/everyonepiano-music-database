### Play Date歌词：

You call me on the telephone you feel so far away  
You tell me to come over they're some games you want to play  
I'm walking to your house nobody's home  
It's just me and you you and me alone  
We're just playing hide and seek  
It's getting hard to breath under the sheets with you  
I don't want to play no games  
I'm tired of always chasing chasing after you  
I don't give a f**k about you anyways  
Whoever said I give a sh*t about you  
You never share your toys or communicate  
I guess I'm just a play date to you  
Wake up in your bedroom and there's nothing left to say  
When I try to talk you're always playing board games  
I wish I had monopoly over your mind  
I wish I didn't care all the time  
We're just playing hide and seek  
It's getting hard to breath under the sheets with you  
I don't want to play no games  
I'm tired of always chasing chasing after you  
I don't give a f**k about you anyways  
Whoever said I give a sh*t about you  
You never share your toys or communicate  
I guess I'm just a play date to you  
Ring around the rosy  
I never know I never know what you need  
Ring around the rosy  
I want to give you want to give you  
What you need  
I don't give a f**k about you anyways  
Whoever said I give a sh*t about you  
You never share your toys or communicate  
I guess I'm just a play date to you  
You know I give a f**k about you everyday  
Guess it's time I tell you the truth  
If I share my toys will you let me stay  
Don't want to leave this play date with you
