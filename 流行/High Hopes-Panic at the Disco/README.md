**High Hopes双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_High Hopes_ 是美国另类摇滚的乐队Panic! at the Disco的歌曲。Panic! At The
Disco这名字看来有点古怪。根据他们的解释，"Panic"一字是引自加洲奥兰治县(The O.C.!!)乐队Name Taken中的一句歌词，以及The
Smiths的同名歌曲而作成的。虽然他们没有对At The Disco作任何注解，但是凭着这个字根，你也可以想象他们的音乐类型了。

### High Hopes歌词：

Had to have high high hopes for a living  
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing  
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision  
Always had high high hopes  
Had to have high high hopes for a living  
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling  
I was gonna be that one in a million  
Always had high high hopes  
Mama said  
Fulfill the prophecy  
Be something greater  
Go make a legacy  
Manifest destiny  
Back in the days  
We wanted everything wanted everything  
Mama said  
Burn your biographies  
Rewrite your history  
Light up your wildest dreams  
Museum victories everyday  
We wanted everything wanted everything  
Mama said don't give up it's a little complicated  
All tied up no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting  
Had to have high high hopes for a living  
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing  
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision  
Always had high high hopes  
Had to have high high hopes for a living  
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling  
I was gonna be that one in a million  
Always had high high hopes  
Mama said  
It's uphill for oddities  
The stranger crusaders  
Ain't ever wannabes  
The weird and the novelties  
Don't ever change  
We wanted everything wanted everything  
Stay up on that rise  
Stay up on that rise and never come down  
Stay up on that rise  
Stay up on that rise and never come down  
Mama said don't give up it's a little complicated  
All tied up no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting  
They say it's all been done but they haven't seen the best of me  
So I got one more run and it's gonna be a sight to see  
Had to have high high hopes for a living  
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing  
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision  
Always had high high hopes  
Had to have high high hopes for a living  
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling  
I was gonna be that one in a million  
Always had high high hopes  
Had to have high high hopes for a living  
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing  
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision  
Always had high high hopes  
Had to have high high hopes for a living  
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling  
I was gonna be that one in a million  
Always had high high hopes
