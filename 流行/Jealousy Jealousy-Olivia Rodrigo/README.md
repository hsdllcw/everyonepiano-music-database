### Jealousy, Jealousy歌词：

I kinda wanna throw my phone across the room  
'Cause all I see are girls too good to be true  
With paper white teeth and perfect bodies  
Wish I didn't care  
I know their beauty's not my lack  
But it feels like that weight is on my back  
And I can't let it go  
Com-comparison is killin' me slowly  
I think I think too much  
'Bout kids who don't know me  
I'm so sick of myself I'd rather be rather be  
Anyone anyone else  
My jealousy jealousy started followin' me  
He-he-he he  
Started followin' me  
He-he-he he  
And I see everyone gettin' all the things I want  
And I'm happy for them but then again I'm not  
Just cool vintage clothes and vacation photos  
I can't stand it oh God I sound crazy  
Their win is not my loss  
I know it's true  
But I can't help gettin' caught up in it all  
Com-comparison is killin' me slowly  
I think I think too much  
'Bout kids who don't know me  
I'm so sick of myself I'd rather be rather be  
Anyone anyone else  
My jealousy jealousy  
Yeah all your friends are so cool you go out every night  
In your daddy's nice car yeah you're livin' the life  
Got a pretty face a pretty boyfriend too  
I wanna be you so bad and I don't even know you  
All I see is what I should be  
Happier prettier jealousy jealousy  
All I see is what I should be  
I'm losin' it all I get's jealousy jealousy  
Com-comparison is killin' me slowly  
I think I think too much  
'Bout kids who don't know me  
And I'm so sick of myself I'd rather be rather be  
Oh oh  
Anyone anyone else  
Anybody else  
Jealousy jealousy  
Oh  
I'm so sick of myself I'd rather be rather be  
Oh-oh-oh  
Anyone anyone else  
Jealousy jealousy  
Started followin' me
