### R.I.P.歌词：

[Rita Ora]  
R.I.P, to the girl you used to see  
Her days are over, baby she's over  
I decided to give you all of me  
Baby come closer, baby come closer  
[Tinie Tempah]  
Sexy senorita, I feel you ora  
Jump out at no remoter  
Get in my flight and saucer  
I'll make you call me daddy  
Even though you ain't my daughter  
Baby I ain't talking books  
When I say that I can take you across the borders  
I'm young and free, I'm london G  
I'm tan and cheek  
So they be giving us some try to drink  
Slow and steady for me  
Go on like a desert for me  
And say the words soon as you're ready for me  
[Rita Ora]  
I'm ready for ya  
Hit 'em all, switch it up  
Put it on, zip it up  
Let my perfume, soak into your sweater  
Say you'll be here soon, sooner the better  
No option for, you saying no  
I run this game, just a play a role  
Follow my lead, what you waiting for?  
Thought it over and decided tonight is your night  
[Chorus]  
R.I.P, to the girl you used to see  
Her days are over, baby she's over  
I decided to give you all of me  
Baby come closer, baby come closer  
[Rita Ora]  
Nothing on, I strut around  
I do it big, I shut it down  
I wonder if you'll be able to handle me  
Mental pictures, no cameras please  
[Chorus]  
R.I.P, to the girl you used to see  
Her days are over, baby she's over  
I decided to give you all of me  
Baby come closer, baby come closer  
(I, I, I'm ready for ya)  
[Bridge]  
Yeah I hear you talking  
Don't know who you trying to flatter  
Got my mind made up (I, I, I'm ready for ya)  
I'm in contro, but with you being a man, you don't seem to understand (I,  
I, I'm ready for ya)  
I, I, I'm ready for ya  
I, I, I'm ready for ya  
So keep thinking you the man  
Cause it's all part of a plan  
I, I, I'm ready for ya  
[Outro]  
R.I.P, to the girl you used to see  
Her days are over...
