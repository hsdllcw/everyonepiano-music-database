### Creepin'歌词：

Ooh ooh-ooh  
Ooh-ooh-ooh  
Just can't believe this man  
Metro Boomin want some more n***a  
Somebody said they saw you  
The person you were kissing wasn't me  
And I would never ask you  
I just kept it to myself  
I don't wanna know  
If you're playin' me keep it on the low  
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore  
And if you're creepin' please don't let it show  
Oh baby I don't wanna know  
Oh-oh oh-oh oh-woah  
Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh  
Oh yeah  
I think about it when I hold you  
When lookin' in your eyes I can't believe  
And I don't need to know the truth  
Baby keep it to yourself  
I don't wanna know  
If you're playin' me keep it on the low  
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore  
And if you're creepin' please don't let it show  
Oh baby I don't wanna know  
Did he touch you better than me  
Touch you better than me  
Did he watch you fall asleep  
Watch you fall asleep  
Did you show him all those things that you used to do to me  
If you're better off that way  
Better off that way  
There ain't more that I can say  
More that I can say  
Just go on and do your thing and don't come back to me  
Ooh ooh-ooh  
Ooh-ooh-ooh  
Woah woah woah 21  
Had me questioned I was cuffin' like the precinct  
How you go from housewife to a sneaky link  
Got you riding 'round in all type of Benzes and Rovers  
Girl you used to ride in the rinky dink  
I'm the one put you on Elliantte  
On God  
Fashion Nova model I put you on the runway  
On God  
You was rockin' coach bags got you Chane'-ne'  
Sad ***** in Fresco I call her my baby  
21  
I got a girl but I still feel alone  
On God  
If you playin' me that mean my home ain't home  
On God  
Havin' nightmares of goin' through your phone  
21  
Can't even record you got me out my zone  
I don't wanna know  
If you're playin' me keep it on the low  
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore  
And if you're creepin' please don't let it show  
Oh baby I don't wanna know  
If you're playin' me keep it on the low  
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore  
And if you're creepin' please don't let it show  
Oh baby I don't wanna know  
If you creepin' just don't let me find out  
On God  
Get a hotel never bring 'em to the house  
On God  
If you're better off that way  
Baby all that I can say  
If you're gonna do your thing then don't come back to me
