### Blurred Lines歌词：

[Intro: Pharrell] Everybody get up  
Everybody get up Hey, hey, hey  
Hey, hey, hey Hey, hey, hey  
[Verse 1: Robin Thicke]  
If you can't hear what I'm trying to say  
If you can't read from the same page  
Maybe I'm going deaf, maybe I'm going blind  
Maybe I'm out of my mind  
[Pre-chorus: Robin Thicke]  
Ok now he was close, tried to domesticate you  
But you're an animal, baby it's in your nature  
Just let me liberate you （Hey, hey, hey）  
You don't need no papers （Hey, hey, hey）  
Than man is not your maker  
[Chorus: Robin Thicke]  
And that's why I'm gon' take a good girl  
I know you want it I know you want it  
I know you want it You're a good girl  
Can't let it get passed me  
You're far from plastic  
Talk about getting blasting  
I hate these blurred lines  
I know you want it I know you want it  
I know you want it But you're a good girl  
The way you grab me Must wanna get nasty  
Go ahead, get at me  
[Verse 2: Robin Thicke]  
What do they make dreams for  
When you got them jeans on  
What do feelings stem from  
You the hottest bitch in this place  
I feel so lucky, you wanna hug me  
（Hey, hey, hey） What rhymes with hug me?  
（Hey, hey, hey） Everybody get up  
[Pre-chorus: Robin Thicke]  
Ok now he was close, tried to domesticate you  
But you're an animal, baby it's in your nature  
Just let me liberate you （Hey, hey, hey）  
You don't need no papers  
（Hey, hey, hey） Than man is not your maker  
（Hey, hey, hey）  
[Chorus: Robin Thicke]  
And that's why I'm gon' take a good girl  
I know you want it I know you want it  
I know you want it You're a good girl  
Can't let it get passed me You're far from plastic  
Talk about getting blasting  
I hate these blurred lines  
I know you want it I know you want it  
I know you want it But you're a good girl  
The way you grab me  
Must wanna get nasty  
Go ahead, get at me  
[Verse 3: T.I.]  
One thing I ask you  
Let me be there when you bet that ass too  
Yo, from Malibu, to Paribu  
Yeah, had a big machine daddy  
So hit me up when you pass through  
I'll give you something big enough to take your ass too  
Swag on, when you dress casual  
I mean it's not most unbearable  
Then, honey you're not there when I'm  
With my foresight bitch you pay me by  
Nothing like your leg, I ain't too square for you  
I'll smack that ass and pull your hair like that  
So I jail watch, hand wave for you to salute  
But you didn't pick  
Not many women get a puberty  
But I'm a nice guy, but you get it if you get with me  
[Bridge: Robin Thicke]  
Shake the vibe, get down, get up  
Do it like it hurt, like it hurt  
Watcha doing like word Everybody get up  
[Pre-chorus: Robin Thicke]  
Baby can you breathe  
I got this from Jamaica  
It always works for me Dakota to Dakata, uh huh  
No more pretending （Hey, hey, hey）  
Cause now you winning （Hey, hey, hey）  
Here's our beginning  
[Chorus: Robin Thicke]  
I always wanted a good girl  
Everybody get up I know you want it  
I know you want it I know you want it  
You're a good girl  
Can't let it get passed me You're far from plastic  
Talk about getting blasting  
I hate these blurred lines  
Everybody get up I know you want it  
I know you want it I know you want it  
But you're a good girl The way you grab me  
Must wanna get nasty Go ahead, get at me  
[Outro: Pharrell]  
Everybody get up Everybody get up  
（Hey, hey, hey） （Hey, hey, hey）  
（Hey, hey, hey）
