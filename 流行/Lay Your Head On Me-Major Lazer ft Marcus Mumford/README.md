### Lay Your Head On Me歌词：

When you're numb to the touch  
You cannot chase this ghost away  
And this too shall pass this too shall pass  
It won't always be the same  
And every single scar that you claim  
Is a stone in the path to this place  
And every single choice that you make  
Has led you this way so lay your head on me  
Lay your head on me  
Lay your head on me  
Lay your head on me  
Don't be afraid love  
And I can see it in your eyes love  
Your secret is not safe with me  
You can spin through the night with your powdered mind  
But don't cover up your scars for me  
And every single choice that you make  
Is a stone in the path to this place  
And every single cut that you claim  
Has led you this way  
Lay your head on me  
Lay your head on me  
Lay your head on me  
Lay your head on me  
Don't be afraid love  
I said it's okay it's alright  
Someday we will be fine  
Staring down the long night  
Waiting for the sunrise  
It's alright it's okay  
I've been there in your place  
It's okay it's alright  
Just lay your head on me  
It's okay it's alright  
Lay your head on me  
It's okay it's alright  
Lay your head on me  
It's okay it's alright  
Lay your head on me  
It's okay it's alright  
Don't be afraid love
