### Believe歌词：

No matter how hard I try  
纵然我付出万般尝试  
You keep pushing me aside and I can't break through  
你仍不停将我推离 我终难破你心墙  
There's no talking to you  
无言相对  
It's so sad that you're leaving, it takes time to believe it  
你的离去让我心碎 仍旧需时日去接受这事实  
But after all is said and done  
但怎奈尘埃落定 再难逆转  
You're gonna be the lonely one, oh  
你将孤身一人  
Do you believe in life after love?  
在经历过爱情后你可还会相信生活?  
I can feel something inside me say  
我能感到我心中有个声音在说  
I really don't think you're strong enough, no  
我可不觉得你已足够坚强  
Do you believe in life after love?

I can feel something inside me say

I really don't think you're strong enough, no  
我可不觉得你已足够坚强  
What am I supposed to do  
我该怎么做才好呢  
Sit around and wait for you well I can't do that  
停止原地 为你守候?我可不能那样做  
There's no turning back  
再无破镜重圆可言  
It takes time to move on, It takes love to feel strong  
忘记往事需要时间 重新坚强需要爱情  
And I've got time to think it through  
我花了些时间终于想明白了  
And maybe I'm too good for you, oh  
或许是你配不上我的好  
Do you believe in life after love?  
在经历过爱情后你可还会相信生活?

And I know that I'll get through this  
而我明白我会抗过这一遭  
Cause I know that I am strong  
因为我甚至我足够强大  
I don't need you anymore  
我不再需要着你  
I don't need you anymore  
我不再期待着你  
I don't need you anymore  
我不再为你等待  
I don't need you anymore  
也不再为你欣喜为你忧愁
