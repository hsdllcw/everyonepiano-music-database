### Just Gettin' Started歌词：

I knew the minute that I picked you up  
It was gonna be a wild ride  
You kissed me like you couldn't get enough  
Barely made it out of your drive  
Burning a little rubber at the red light  
Got a little warning from the blue lights  
It's only going on 9 o'clock but feels more like midnight

We ain't even turned up the radio  
Ain't been two miles down the road  
The way you look at me baby I don't know  
If we even gonna make it to the party  
Yeah we gotta whole lot of moon light left  
Already having the time of our lives  
And we're just getting started tonight

Girl you already got the window down  
And you got your seat laid back  
I ain't even make it halfway to town  
And you already talking about a 6 pack  
Already got your shoes off  
And you talking about slippin' off  
No we ain't even found your friends saying  
You already wanna get lost

We ain't even turned up the radio  
Ain't been two miles down the road  
The way you look at me baby I don't know  
If we even gonna make it to the party  
Yeah we gotta whole lot of moon light left  
Already have the time of our lives  
And we're just getting started tonight

Ain't had a drink and I'm torn up  
Ain't even had a taste of your love  
But girl the crazy thing is  
We're just getting warmed up

We ain't even turned up the radio  
Ain't been two miles down the road  
The way you look at me baby I don't know  
If we even gonna make it to the party  
Yeah we gotta whole lot of moon light left  
Already have the time of our lives  
And we're just getting started tonight

And we're just getting started, tonight
