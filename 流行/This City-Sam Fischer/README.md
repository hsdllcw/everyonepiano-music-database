**This City** 是澳大利亚新时代唱作才子Sam Fischer演唱的歌曲，其富有穿透力的嗓音诉说着城市的落寞。

为了音乐的梦想，Sam
Fischer只身前往洛杉矶，后来毕业于著名的伯克利音乐学院。但现实依旧残酷，就像歌曲MV中的电视戏剧一般，跌跌撞撞，被拥抱过，也被抛弃过。在美国的音乐路上，他处处被拒绝，作品不但在没有发行的情况下直接被唱片厂牌解约，甚至一度只能睡在朋友的车上。还好梦想从未被孤独打败，他坚持创作的才华，真挚深情的嗓音，早已成为了国外各大音乐平台的热门歌曲！

### This City歌词：

I've been seeing lonely people in crowded rooms  
Covering their old heartbreaks with new tattoos  
It's all about smoke screens and cigarettes  
Looking through low lights at silhouettes  
But all I see is lonely people in crowded rooms  
This city's gonna break my heart  
This city's gonna love me then leave me alone  
This city's got me chasing stars  
It's been a couple months since I felt like I'm home  
Am I getting closer to knowing where I belong  
This city's gonna break my heart  
She's always gonna break your heart oh  
I remember mornings when my head didn't hurt  
And I remember nights when art didn't feel like work  
She wakes up at noon and she's out 'til three  
She leaves her perfume all over me  
But I remember mornings when my head didn't hurt  
This city's gonna break my heart  
This city's gonna love me then leave me alone  
This city's got me chasing stars  
It's been a couple months since I felt like I'm home  
Am I getting closer to knowing where I belong  
This city's gonna break my heart  
She's always gonna break your heart oh  
She got a hold on me  
She got me wrapped round her finger  
She got a hold on me  
She got me wrapped round her finger oh yeah  
This city's gonna break my heart  
This city's gonna love me then leave me alone  
This city's got me chasing stars  
It's been a couple months since I felt like I'm home  
Am I getting closer to knowing where I belong  
This city's gonna break my heart  
She's always gonna break your heart oh  
This city's gonna break my heart hey  
She's always gonna break your heart
