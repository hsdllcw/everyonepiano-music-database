### Hard 2 Face Reality歌词：

Poo Bear：  
Sometimes it's hard to face reality oh oh  
Even though you might get mad at me oh oh  
Sometimes it's hard to face reality  
Should've been adjusted to my life  
Had the opportunity to stay and wait for the last time  
Now you're standin' right in front of me  
It hurts me to know that I lied  
Tryna protect your feelings  
You been in between the lines  
Hope your heart has started healing  
Sometimes it's hard to face reality oh oh  
Even though you might get mad at me oh oh  
Sometimes it's hard to face reality  
Justin Bieber：  
Don't be afraid to stand alone  
Don't be afraid to stand outside your comfort zone  
I know it's hard away from home  
And it ain't easy all alone  
Relationships over the phone  
Talkin' to your significant other all night long  
Sometimes it's hard to face reality oh oh  
Even though you might get mad at me oh oh  
Sometimes it's hard to face reality  
Sometimes it's hard to face reality  
Jay Electronica：  
Love and death are quite similar  
How they come and go like cat burglars  
Reality is kinda hard to face  
Like actual facts is to flat-earthers  
Rain's a requirement for flowers to grow  
And pain's a requirement for power to grow  
It's a miracle how one could change from one what was just hours ago  
Such is life though it's just a cycle  
The bigger picture and the smaller picture  
Exactly same it's macro micro  
Crack yo' atom and let yo' light glow  
One day you could be the king of pop  
Then the next one just be wack ol' Michael  
It's human nature just like he told us  
Let's face reality crack the cycle  
Poo Bear：  
Know it hurts to see the truth in your face  
Circumstances bring you down to your knees  
Go on and cry an ocean but don't drown in it  
Enough to put your heart at ease  
Oh don't lose your self esteem  
I apologise for being a man  
It's way harder than what it seems  
Justin Bieber/Poo Bear：  
Sometimes it's hard to face reality oh oh reality  
Even though you might get mad at me  
You might get mad at me  
Oh oh  
But I'll be at your bedside  
Sometimes it's hard to face reality oh oh  
Sometimes it's hard to face reality oh oh
