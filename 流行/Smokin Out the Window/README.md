《 **Smokin Out The Window** 》是Bruno Mars、Anderson Paak、Silk
Sonic演唱的歌曲，收录于专辑《An Evening With Silk
Sonic》，于2021年11月5日发行。这首新歌简直太上头了！歌曲是对渣女的控诉：这个女人让我为她支付房租，掏钱带她旅行，最后我却孤孤单单一人。

Bruno

.Paak是来自加利福尼亚州奥克斯纳德的说唱歌手、歌曲作者、唱片制作人和多乐器演奏家。

### Smokin Out the Window歌词：

Wait a minute, this love started out so tender, so sweet  
But now she got me smokin' out the window  
Must've spent thirty five, forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (Oh, no)  
Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib  
Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa)  
Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC  
Can't believe it (Can't believe it)  
I'm in disbelief  
This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips  
Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist  
And here I am all alone (All alone)  
I'm so cold, I'm so cold  
You got me out here  
Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window)  
Singin' "How could she do this to me?"  
(How could she do this to me?)  
I thought that girl belonged to only me  
But I was wrong  
'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody  
Just the other night she was grippin' on me tight  
Screamin' "Hercules" (Hercules, Hercules)  
Got me in the club lookin' for a new love  
Someone help me please (Help me please, help me please)  
Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl?  
Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die  
This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips  
Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist  
And here I am all alone (All alone)  
I'm so cold, I'm so cold  
You got me out here  
Smokin' out the window  
Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo  
Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How)  
"How could she do this?"  
I thought that girl belonged to only me  
(One thing's fo' sho', one thing's fo' sho)  
But I was wrong (I was wrong)  
'Cause she belong (She belong)  
To everybody  
Yes, she belong to everybody  
Everybody  
That girl, yeah she belong to everybody  
(Oh, no)  
Look here baby  
I hope you find whatever it is that you need  
But I also hope that your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round barefoot in these
streets  
Look out  
Girl, it breaks my heart that you're not here with me  
Now I gotta give you back (Gotta give you back)  
To the city, oh, you got me  
Smokin' out the window  
Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How)  
"How could she do this to me?"  
(How could you, how could you do this, baby?)  
I thought that girl belonged to only me  
But I was wrong (I was wrong)  
'Cause she belong (She belong)  
To everybody (Yeah, she belong to everybody)  
Everybody, ooh (Yeah, she belong to everybody)
