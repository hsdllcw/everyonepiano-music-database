### One Day More歌词：

ay more!  
Another day, another destiny.  
This never-ending road to Calvary;  
These men who seem to know my crime  
Will surely come a second time.  
One day more!

[MARIUS]  
I did not live until today.  
How can I live when we are parted?

[VALJEAN]  
One day more.

[MARIUS & COSETTE]  
Tomorrow you'll be worlds away  
And yet with you, my world has started!

[EPONINE]  
One more day all on my own.

[MARIUS & COSETTE]  
Will we ever meet again?

[EPONINE]  
One more day with him not caring.

[MARIUS & COSETTE]  
I was born to be with you.

[EPONINE]  
What a life I might have known.

[MARIUS & COSETTE]  
And I swear I will be true!

[EPONINE]  
But he never saw me there!

[ENJOLRAS]  
One more day before the storm!

[MARIUS]  
Do I follow where she goes?

[ENJOLRAS]  
At the barricades of freedom.

[MARIUS]  
Shall I join my brothers there?

[ENJOLRAS]  
When our ranks begin to form

[MARIUS]  
Do I stay; and do I dare?

[ENJOLRAS]  
Will you take your place with me?

[ALL]  
The time is now, the day is here

[VALJEAN]  
One day more!

[JAVERT]  
One day more to revolution,  
We will nip it in the bud!  
We'll be ready for these schoolboys,  
They will wet themselves with blood!

[VALJEAN]  
One day more!

[M. & MME. THENARDIER]  
Watch 'em run amuck,  
Catch 'em as they fall,  
Never know your luck  
When there's a free for all,  
Here's a little 'dip'  
There a little 'touch'  
Most of them are goners  
So they won't miss much!

[Students (2 Groups)]  
[1:] One day to a new beginning

[2:] Raise the flag of freedom high!

[1:] Every man will be a king

[2:] Every man will be a king

[1:] There's a new world for the winning

[2:] There's a new world to be won

[ALL]  
Do you hear the people sing?

[MARIUS]  
My place is here, I fight with you!

[VALJEAN]  
One day more!

[MARIUS & COSETTE]  
I did not live until today.

[EPONINE]  
One more day all on my own!

[MARIUS & COSETTE]  
How can I live when we are parted?

[JAVERT (overlapping)]  
We will join these people's heroes  
We will follow where they go  
We will learn their little secrets,  
We will know the things they know.

[VALJEAN]  
One day more!

[MARIUS & COSETTE]  
Tomorrow you'll be worlds away

[EPONINE]  
What a life I might have known!

[MARIUS & COSETTE]  
And yet with you my world has started

[JAVERT (overlapping)]  
One more day to revolution  
We will nip it in the bud  
We'll be ready for these schoolboys

[THENARDIERS (overlapping)]  
Watch 'em run amok  
Catch 'em as they fall  
Never know your luck  
When there's a free-for-all!

[VALJEAN]  
Tomorrow we'll be far away,  
Tomorrow is the judgement day

[ALL]  
Tomorrow we'll discover  
What our God in Heaven has in store!  
One more dawn  
One more day  
One day more!
