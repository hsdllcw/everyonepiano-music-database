**Wanted双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Wanted_
是美国流行摇滚乐队OneRepublic演唱的歌曲。从《Connection》开始，OneRepublic的作品变得短小精悍，本单也不例外。两分多钟的音轨，富有节奏变化的drop，OneRepublic忽高忽低、缓促分明、似阴似阳的魔幻唱腔与深厚而富有哲理的歌词完美融合，在给予听众听觉享受的同时，也传达出了歌词的内涵。人人都希望成为别人需要的人亦或唯一，没人愿意用辛勤付出换来竹篮打水一场空，虽然难寻伯乐，但人亦如此，或许，你会在不经意间找到那一块拼图。音乐的灵魂在歌词，OneRepublic的作品不落窠臼，完美驾驭住了音乐之灵魂。

### Wanted歌词：

She said every time I close my eyes  
I feels like I could disappear  
Disappear  
I could overflow an ocean with the cavalcade of all my tears  
All my tears  
And I know I sound dramatic  
But that's just how it feels  
How it feels  
She said I'm holdin' to the notion that I'll find somethin' real  
And I just want to be wanted  
Oh  
I could use a little love sometimes  
I just need to be needed  
Oh  
Like to know I'm crossin' someone's mind  
I just wanna be someone that somebody needs  
I just wanna be more than the a drop in sea  
I just wanna be  
She said I'm countin' up my karma  
And I think it's time to cash it in  
So tired of livin' in a shadow of a mountain of what might've been  
And I know I sound dramatic but that's just how it feels  
I've been looking fthat somebody to tell me that I'm real  
I just want to be wanted  
Oh  
I could use a little love sometimes  
I just need to be needed  
Oh  
Like to know I'm crossin' someone's mind  
I just wanna be someone that somebody needs  
I just wanna be more than the a drop in sea  
I just wanna be wanted  
Oh yeah  
We just wanna be wanted  
Oh  
I just wanna be wanted  
I could use a little love sometimes  
I just need to be needed  
Like to know I'm crossin' someone's mind
