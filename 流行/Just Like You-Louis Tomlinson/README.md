### Just Like You歌词：

It's the guy from the one band  
Cigarette in my left hand  
Whole world in my right hand  
25 and it's all planned  
Night out and it's ten grand  
Headlines that I can't stand  
But you only get half of the story  
The cash and the cars and the glory  
No sleep and we party utill morning  
Cos nobody cares when you're boring  
I'm just like you  
Even though my problems look nothing like yours do  
Yeah I get sad too  
And when I'm down I need somebody to talk to  
Yeah I feel the same as you do too  
Same stress same sh*t to go through  
I'm just like you  
If you only knew  
If I had it my way pub lunch every Sunday  
Cheap beer and it's okay  
I wanna lay where she lays  
I wanna stay in these days  
Gonna smoke and it's okay  
But you only get half of the story  
The cash and the cars and the glory  
Just like everyone else here before me  
Cos nobody cares when you're boring  
I'm just like you  
Even though my problems look nothing like yours do  
Yeah I get sad too  
And when I'm down I need somebody to talk to  
Yeah I feel the same as you do too  
Same stress same sh*t to go through  
I'm just like you  
If you only knew  
Every heart breaks the same  
Every tear leaves a stain  
Can I just be the same  
Every heart breaks the same  
Every tear leaves a stain  
Let me be the same  
I'm just like you  
Even though my problems look nothing like yours do  
Yeah I get sad too  
And when I'm down I need somebody to talk to  
Yeah I feel the same as you do too  
Same stress same sh*t to go through  
I'm just like you  
If you only knew  
If you only knew
