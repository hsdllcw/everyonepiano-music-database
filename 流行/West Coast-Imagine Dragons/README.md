### West Coast歌词：

One more day we'll spend together  
Lay your eyes look up upon me for the better  
Oh I know I'm worse for weather  
But my love I won't give up  
Spend my days cursing my soul  
Wishing I could paint my scars to make me whole  
Oh I know I could be better  
But my love I won't give up  
I ain't no Superman I ain't no Holy Ghost  
I'm just the one that keeps you up at night you love the most  
I'll be your strong man I'll be your West Coast  
I'll be the sun I'll be the waves I'll be the one you love the most  
Oh I'll be I'll be I'll be I'll be I'll be your West Coast honey  
Oh I'll be I'll be I'll be I'll be I'll be your West Coast honey  
I'll change my ways if you would stay  
All your tears that you have cried will go away  
Oh just grant me one more day  
Oh my love please don't give up  
See the Devil at my door  
I see the future of the ones that I've ignored  
I guess I was born to be at war  
But my love I won't give up  
So my love please don't give up  
I ain't no Superman I ain't no Holy Ghost  
I'm just the one who keeps you up at night you love the most  
I'll be your strong man I'll be your West Coast  
I'll be the sun I'll be the waves I'll be the one you love the most  
Oh I'll be I'll be I'll be I'll be I'll be your West Coast honey  
Oh I'll be I'll be I'll be I'll be I'll be your West Coast honey  
Oh I'll be I'll be I'll be I'll be I'll be your West Coast honey  
I get that feeling  
Oh I'll be I'll be I'll be I'll be I'll be your West Coast honey  
I get that feeling
