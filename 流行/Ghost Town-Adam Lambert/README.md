Ghost Town_ 是歌手亚当•兰伯特演唱的歌曲, 歌曲的创作从2014年早期开始，歌曲的录制于2014年到2015年在瑞典完成。Ghost
Town的源头在西部蛮荒地区。因为于麦当娜2015年的歌Ghost Town名字一样，亚当知道之后很惊讶也很惊喜。但他表示，这首Ghost
Town是一个存在之舞，与麦当娜的那首中节奏的歌曲完全两首不同的歌，只不过标题一样罢了。

### Ghost Town歌词：

Died last night in my dreams  
Walking the streets  
Of some old ghost town  
I tried to believe  
In God and James Dean  
But Hollywood sold out

Saw all of the saints  
Lock up the gates  
I could not enter  
Walked into the flames  
Called out your name  
But there was no answer

And now I know my heart is a ghost town  
My heart is a ghost town  
My heart is a ghost town  
My heart is a ghost town

Died last night in my dreams  
All the machines  
Had been disconnected  
Time was thrown at the wind  
And all of my friends  
Had been disaffected

Now, I'm searching for trust  
In a city of rust  
A city of vampires  
Tonight, Elvis is dead  
And everyone's spread  
And love is a satire

And now I know my heart is a ghost town  
My heart is a ghost town  
My heart is a ghost town  
My heart is a ghost town

There's no one left in the world  
I'm gunslingin'  
[Regular version:] Don't give a fuck if I go  
[Music video version:] Don't give a damn if I go  
Down, down, down  
I got a voice in my head that keeps singing  
Oh, my heart is a ghost town

My heart is a ghost town  
Oh, my heart is a ghost town  
(Said, my heart)  
My heart is a ghost town  
My heart is a ghost town
