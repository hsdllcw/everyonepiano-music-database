### Six Thirty歌词：

Ah hey yeah  
I know I be on some bulls**t  
Know I be driving you crazy  
But I know you love how I whip it  
You can only stay mad for a minute  
So come here and give me some kisses  
You know I'm very delicious  
You know I'm very impatient  
Might change my mind so don't keep me waiting  
I just wonder baby if you're gonna stay  
Even if one day I'll lose it and go crazy  
I know this s**t kinda heavy  
I just wanna tell you directly  
So boy let me know if you ready  
Are you down  
What's up  
Are you down  
What's up  
Are you down  
Are you down  
Are you down  
Are you down  
Are you down  
Mmm  
You know you be on some bulls**t  
Bulls**t  
Act so possessive and crazy  
Crazy  
But I know that's just 'causе you love me  
And you ain't scared to show mе your ugly  
And maybe that's just how it's supposed to be  
I'm the release you the dopamine  
And you wonder baby if I'm gonna stay  
Even if one day you lose it and go crazy  
I know this s**t kinda heavy  
Heavy  
Just wanna ask you directly  
Directly  
Boy let me know if you ready  
Are you down  
What's up  
What's up  
Are you down  
What's up  
What's up  
Are you down  
Are you down  
What's up  
Are you down  
What's up  
Are you down  
Tell me  
Are you down  
Are you gonna be  
Six thirty  
Mmm  
Down like six thirty  
Mmm  
Down like sunset  
Down like sunset  
Down like my head on your chest  
Mmm

Down like six thirty yeah  
What you gon' do when I'm bored  
And I wanna play video games at 2 AM  
What if I need a friend  
Will you ride 'til the end  
Am I enough to keep your love  
When I'm old and stuck will you still have a crush  
Are you down  
What's up  
Are you down  
What's up  
Are you down  
Oh

Tell me

Down like sunset  
Down like sunset  
Down like my head on your chest  
Down like my head on your chest  
Down like six thirty  
Ooh
