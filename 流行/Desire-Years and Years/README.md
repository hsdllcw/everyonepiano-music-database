### Desire歌词：

I must be tough  
I must behave, I must keep fighting  
Don't give it up  
I want to keep us compromising

Open your arms and pray  
To the truth that you're denying  
Give in to the game  
To the sense that you've been hiding

Where are you taking me?  
I can't be blamed  
I want you to want me again

Is it desire  
Or is it love that I'm feeling for you  
I want desire  
Cause your love only gets me abused

Give me that rush  
I want to show you what you've been missing  
Am I enough  
To keep your other lovers hidden

Where are you taking me?  
I can't be blamed  
I want you to want me again

Is it desire  
Or is it love that I'm feeling for you  
I want desire  
Cause your love only gets me abused

Is it desire  
Or is it love that I'm feeling for you  
I want desire  
I wanna see what you're willing to lose

You know that you've got me  
You've locked me down  
You tell me you want me  
You need it now  
You know that you've got me  
You've locked me down  
You tell me you want me now

Is it desire  
Or is it love that I'm feeling for you  
I want desire  
Cause your love only gets me abused

Is it desire?  
Or is it love that I'm feeling for you?  
I want desire  
I wanna see what you're willing to lose
