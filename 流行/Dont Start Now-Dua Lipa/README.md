### Don't Start Now歌词：

If you don't wanna see me  
Did a full one-eighty crazy  
Thinking 'bout the way I was  
Did the heartbreak change me maybe  
But look at where I ended up  
I'm all good already  
So moved on it's scary  
I'm not where you left me at all so  
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody  
If you want to believe that anything could stop me  
Don't show up  
Don't come out  
Don't start caring about me now  
Walk away you know how  
Don't start caring about me now  
Aren't you the guy who  
Tried to hurt me with the word "goodbye"  
Though it took some time to survive you  
I'm better on the other side  
I'm all good already  
So moved on it's scary  
I'm not where you left me at all so  
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody  
If you want to believe that anything could stop me  
Don't show up  
Don't come out  
Don't start caring about me now  
Walk away you know how  
Don't start caring about me now  
Woah woah  
Don't come out  
Out out  
Don't come out  
Woah woah  
Don't start now  
Woah woah  
Don't come out  
Out  
I'm not where you left me at all so  
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody  
If you want to believe that anything could stop me  
Don't show up  
Don't show up  
Don't come out  
Don't come out  
Don't start caring about me now  
About me now  
Walk away  
Walk away  
You know how  
You know how  
Don't start caring about me now  
Hahaha  
Woah woah  
Don't come out  
Out out  
Don't show up  
Woah woah  
Walk away  
Walk away  
Woah woah  
Don't come out  
Out out  
Don't show up  
Out out  
Walk away  
Walk away  
Out
