### Gold Rush歌词：

Gleaming twinkling  
Eyes like sinking  
Ships on waters  
So inviting I almost jump in  
I don't like a gold rush gold rush  
I don't like anticipating my face in a red flush  
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch  
Everybody wants you  
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you  
Walk past quick brush  
I don't like slow motion double vision in rose blush  
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush  
Everybody wants you  
But I don't like a gold rush  
What must it be like to grow up that beautiful  
With your hair falling into place like dominos  
I see me padding across your wooden floors  
With my Eagles t-shirt hanging from the door  
At dinner parties I call you out on your contrarian s**t  
And the coastal town we wandered 'round  
Had never seen a love as pure as it  
And then it fades into the gray of my day old tea  
'Cause it could never be  
'Cause I don't like a gold rush gold rush  
I don't like anticipating my face in a red flush  
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch  
Everybody wants you  
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you  
Walk past quick brush  
I don't like slow motion double vision in rose blush  
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush  
Everybody wants you  
And I don't like a gold rush  
What must it be like to grow up that beautiful  
With your hair falling into place like dominos  
My mind turns your life into folklore  
I can't dare to dream about you anymore  
At dinner parties I won't call you out on your contrarian s**t  
And the coastal town we never found  
Will never see a love as pure as it  
'Cause it fades into the gray of my day old tea  
'Cause it will never be  
Gleaming twinkling  
Eyes like sinking  
Ships on waters  
So inviting I almost jump in
