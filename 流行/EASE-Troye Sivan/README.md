### EASE歌词：

[Verse 1: Troye Sivan]  
I'm down to my skin and bone  
And my mommy, she can't put down the phone  
And stop asking how I'm doing all alone, alone  
But the truth is the stars are falling, ma  
And the wolves are out c-calling, ma  
And my home has never felt this far

[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan & Georgia Nott]  
But all this driving  
Is driving me crazy  
And all this moving  
Is proving to get the best of me  
And I've been trying to hide it  
But lately  
Every time I think I'm better  
Pickin' my head up, getting nowhere  
[Chorus: Troye Sivan & Georgia Nott]  
Take me back to the basics and the simple life  
Tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease  
Your touch, my comfort, and my lullaby  
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night  
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night

[Verse 2: Troye Sivan]  
Now I'm down to my skin and bones  
My baby listens to me on the phone  
But I can't help feeling like I'm all alone, all alone  
The truth is, the stars are falling, babe  
And I'd never ever thought that I would say  
I'm afraid of the life that I've made, I've made

[Pre-Chorus]  
But all this driving  
Is driving me crazy  
And all this moving  
Is proving to get the best of me  
And I've been trying to hide it  
But lately  
Every time I think I'm better  
Pickin' my head up, getting nowhere

[Chorus]  
Take me back to the basics and the simple life  
Tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease  
Your touch, my comfort, and my lullaby  
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night  
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night

[Bridge: Georgia Nott]  
I've been lyin' to them all  
I don't need it anymore  
Don't you worry about me  
I'll be fine if I can breathe  
I've been out here for too long  
Taking shit for how I'm wrong  
How I'm wrong  
Always wrong

[Chorus]  
Take me back to the basics and the simple life  
Tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease  
Your touch, my comfort, and my lullaby  
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night  
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night

[Outro/Chorus]  
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night  
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night  
(Take me back to the basics and the simple life)  
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night  
(Tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease)  
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night  
(Your touch, my comfort, and my lullaby)  
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
