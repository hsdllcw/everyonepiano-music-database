美国创作歌手Olivia Rodrigo（奥利维亚•罗德里戈）近日重返歌坛，推出了新专辑《GUTS》中的首支主打单曲《 **Vampire**
》（吸血鬼），在生动鲜活的音乐情感中拉开了一场沉重的序幕。

《 _Vampire_ 》以快节奏的流行节奏编曲开场，随后是略显悲伤的钢琴和鼓点，加上金属感很明显的有点混乱的音效，显得十分破碎，反映了 Olivia
Rodrigo 伤痛的青春。Olivia Rodrigo
极其真诚、发自肺腑的声乐表演为歌曲增加了不少内容和情感，凸显出在复杂的情感关系中疲惫不堪的心碎和怨恨，赢得了一致好评。

同时，网站还为大家提供了《[ **Deja Vu-Olivia Rodrigo**](Music-12913.html "Deja Vu-Olivia
Rodrigo")》曲谱下载

### Vampire歌词：

Hate to give the satisfaction asking how you're doing now  
How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about  
Just what you wanted  
Look at you cool guy you got it  
I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes  
When I close my eyes  
Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise  
I loved you truly  
Gotta laugh at the stupidity  
Cuz I've made some real big mistakes  
But you make the worst one look fine  
I should've known it was strange  
You only come out at night  
I used to think I was smart  
But you made me look so naive  
The way you sold me for parts  
As you sunk your teeth into me oh  
Bloodsucker fame******  
Bleeding me dry like a goddamn vampire  
Every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad bad news  
You called them crazy god I hate the way  
I called them crazy too  
You're so convincing  
How do you lie without flinching  
How do you lie how do you lie how do you lie  
Oh what a mesmerizing  
Paralyzing ****** up little thrill  
Can't figure out just how you do it and god knows I never will  
Went for me and not her  
Cuz girls your age know better  
I've made some real big mistakes  
But you make the worst one look fine  
I should've known it was strange  
You only come out at night  
I used to think I was smart  
But you made me look so naive  
The way you sold me for parts  
As you sunk your teeth into me oh  
Bloodsucker fame******  
Bleeding me dry like a goddamn vampire  
You said it was true love  
But wouldn't that be hard  
You can't love anyone  
'Cause that would mean you had a heart  
I tried to help you out now I know that I can't  
'Cause how you think's the kind of thing  
I'll never understand  
I've made some real big mistakes  
But you make the worst one look fine  
I should've known it was strange  
You only come out at night  
I used to think I was smart  
But you made me look so naive  
The way you sold me for parts  
As you sunk your teeth into me oh  
Bloodsucker fame******  
Bleeding me dry like a goddamn vampire
