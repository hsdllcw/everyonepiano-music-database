**Wish You Were Here** 是英国摇滚乐队Pink
Floyd同名专辑中的一首歌曲。乐队成立于1965年。风格偏电子和迷幻摇滚，他们不断的演化成一支先锋摇滚乐队。他们哲学化的歌词、声音实验、不断创新的CD封面艺术和精心设计的现场表演都闻名于世。

  
唱片的标题曲《 _Wish You Were Here_ 》同样也是针对Syd Barrett，但也是Roger
Waters对于徘徊在乐队成功的四周围的贪婪所进行的斗争中所感受到的紧张感，而根植于贯穿《Wish You Were
Here》专辑中所体现出来的那种觉醒的主题不断的滋生发展并最终在后来的The Wall中萌发壮大。古典/爵士小提琴手Stephane
Grapelli参加了该曲的录制，也就是全曲结束时那几个小节的风声的合成音响效果的录音。而歌曲的管弦乐片段其实是截取于Tchaikovsky的第四交响曲的录音。本曲以后成为乐队巡回演唱会上的保留曲目，即使是Waters离开乐队后，无论乐团还是他依旧喜欢在各自的演出中演唱它。

### Wish You Were Here歌词：

So, so you think you can tell  
Heaven from Hell,  
Blue skies from pain.  
Can you tell a green field  
From a cold steel rail?  
A smile from a veil?  
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade  
Your heroes for ghosts?  
Hot ashes for trees?  
Hot air for a cool breeze?  
Cold comfort for change?  
And did you exchange  
A walk on part in the war  
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here.  
We're just two lost souls  
Swimming in a fish bowl,  
Year after year,  
Running over the same old ground.  
What have we found  
The same old fears.  
Wish you were here.
