### So Far So Great歌词：

Off to the races  
I'm going places  
Might be a long shot  
Not gonna waste it  
This is the big break  
And it's calling my name  
Yeah

So far so great, get with it  
At least that's how I see it  
Having a dream's just the beginning  
So far so great, believe it  
Can't take away this feeling  
Taking a ride with chance to my side  
Yeah, I can't wait  
So far, so great

Might need to wing it  
Still gonna bring it  
Not gonna sink low  
I'm going swimming  
Swing for the fences  
Sky's not the limit today  
Yeah

So far so great, get with it  
At least that's how I see it  
Having a dream's just the beginning  
So far so great, believe it  
Can't take away this feeling  
Taking a ride with chance to my side  
Yeah, I can't wait  
So far, so great

Everyone says don't get your hopes up  
Learn the ropes and climb the ladder  
I know in the end that just being here is the best  
And it only gets better, it only gets better

So far so great, get with it  
At least that's how I see it  
Having a dream's just the beginning  
So far so great, believe it  
Can't take away this feeling  
Taking a ride with chance to my side  
Yeah, I can't wait  
So far, so great  
I can't wait  
So far so great

Ba ba da da da ba da da da da  
Ba ba da da da ba da da da da  
YOW!!!!
