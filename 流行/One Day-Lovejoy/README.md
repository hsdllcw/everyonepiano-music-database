### One Day歌词：

And stop  
'Cause why'd you have to kill my cat  
Why'd I have to take you back  
And time and time I play the empath  
I don't know why  
But some lights on in an empty pub  
A toilet with the seat left up  
Is closure like a deer in headlights  
One day I know that you will be there  
One day I'll focus on the future  
Maybe one day oh baby  
Isn't life so f**king inconsistent  
One day I know that you will be there  
One day I'll focus on the future  
Maybe one day oh baby  
Isn't life so f**king inconsistent  
She said  
Let's talk about what I want to do  
'Cause all I want to do is turn back time  
At least a couple Tuesdays  
To before I found one life turn two  
I said it last time  
But I'm not afraid of empty rooms  
I'm not afraid of new perfume  
And in fact my dear  
I'm f**king terrified  
One day I know that you will be there  
One day I'll focus on the future  
Maybe one day oh baby  
Isn't life so f**king inconsistent  
One day I know that you will be there  
One day I'll focus on the future  
Maybe one day oh baby  
Isn't life so f**king inconsistent  
Woo  
'Cause I know that  
One day I know that you will be there  
One day I'll focus on the future  
Maybe one day oh baby  
Isn't life so f**king inconsistent  
One day I know that you will be there  
One day I'll focus on the future  
Maybe one day oh baby  
Isn't life so f**king inconsistent
