### Fool for You歌词：

[Verse 1: ZAYN]  
This love is tainted, I need you and I hate it  
You're caught between a dream and a movie scene  
In a way, you know what I mean  
When the darts just miss, I just can't resist it

[Chorus: ZAYN]  
Cause I'm a fool for you and the things you do  
I'm a fool for you and the things, the things you do  
The things you do  
The things you do  
[Verse 2: ZAYN]  
When you're looking like this, I just can't resist it  
I know sometimes I hide it  
But I can't this time cause it's gonna defeat me  
But you won't believe me, believe me

[Chorus: ZAYN]  
Cause I'm a fool for you and the things you do  
I'm a fool for you and the things, the things you do

[Bridge: ZAYN]  
I know, I know given the chance I'd do it again  
Cause I can't help myself  
Cause I can't stop myself  
I just love being a fool for you

[Chorus: ZAYN]  
Cause I'm a fool for you and the things you do  
I'm a fool for you and the things, the things you do

[Outro: ZAYN]  
This love is tainted
