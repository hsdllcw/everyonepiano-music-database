### Eyes Closed歌词：

I know it's a bad idea  
But how can I help myself  
Been inside for most this year  
And I thought a few drinks they might help  
It's been a while my dear  
Dealing with the cards life dealt  
I'm still holding back these tears  
While my friends are somewhere else  
I pictured this year a little bit different when it hit February  
I step in the bar it hit me so hard  
Oh how can it be this heavy  
Every song reminds me you're gone  
And I feel the lump form in my throat  
'Coz I'm here alone  
Just dancing with my eyes closed  
'Coz everywhere I look I still see you  
Time is moving so slow  
And I don't know what else that I can do  
So I'll keep dancing with my eyes closed  
So I'll keep dancing with my  
Delusion is here again  
And I think you'll come home soon  
A word brings me right back in  
Then it's only me that's in this room  
I guess I could just pretend  
The colours are more than blue  
But I lost more than my friend  
I can't help but missing you  
I pictured this month a little bit different no one is ever ready  
And when it unfolds you get in a hole  
Oh how can it be this heavy  
Everything changes nothing's the same  
Except the truth is now you're gone  
And life just goes on  
So I'm dancing with my eyes closed  
'Coz everywhere I look I still see you  
Time is moving so slow  
And I don't know what else that I can do  
So I'll keep dancing with my eyes closed  
So I'll keep dancing with my eyes closed  
Oh I'll keep dancing with my  
They're shutting the bar  
They're cleaning the floor  
And everyone is already home  
But I'm on my own  
Still dancing with my eyes closed  
'Coz everywhere I look I still see you  
Time is moving so slow  
And I don't know what else that I can do  
So I'll keep dancing with my eyes closed  
Oh I'll keep dancing with my eyes closed  
Oh I'll keep dancing with my
