### My Eden歌词：

There's a stone for the things forgotten  
Just a stone for all you wanted  
Look a stone for what will not be  
All you thought was there  
Count the stones don't think about him  
Let the stones become your mountain  
Let them go the nights you doubted  
All those thousand cares  
Softly now thread  
Through the towns and the dark  
Softly be led  
By the clouds and the stars  
When the distances grow  
When the winds start to blow  
Something whispers from afar  
There's a home in the heart  
Another heaven  
There's a time for everything  
There's a song for every dream  
（There's a song）  
There's a stone for every action  
For the things you won't look back on  
Look a stone for all that will be  
All that still is me  
Softly now thread  
Through the sounds of the dark  
Softly be led  
By the clouds and the stars  
When the distances grow  
When the winds start to blow  
Something whispers from afar  
There's a home in the heart  
Another heaven  
There's a time for everything  
There's a song for every dream  
There's a world that's yet to be  
There's a time for everything  
There's a song for every dream
