### The Man歌词：

Girl, you can tell everybody  
Yeah, you can tell everybody  
Go ahead and tell everybody  
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man  
Yes, I am, yes, I am, yes, I am  
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man  
I believe every lie that I ever told  
Paid for every heart that I ever stole  
I paid my cause and I didn't fold  
Well, it ain't that hard when you got soul  
This is my world  
Somewhere I heard that life is a test  
I been though the worst but I still give my best  
God made my mold different from the rest  
Then he broke that mold so I know I'm blessed  
This is my world  
Stand up now and face the sun  
Won't hide my tail or turn and run  
It's time to do what must be done  
Be a king when kingdom comes  
Girl, you can tell everybody  
Yeah, you can tell everybody  
Go ahead and tell everybody  
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man  
Girl, you can tell everybody  
Yeah, you can tell everybody  
Go ahead and tell everybody  
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man  
Yes, I am, yes, I am, yes, I am  
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man  
I got all the answers to your questions  
I'll be the teacher, you could be the lesson  
I'll be the preacher, you be the confession  
I'll be the quick relief to all your stressing  
This is my world  
It's a thin line between love and hate  
Is you really real or is you really fake?  
I'm a solider standing on my feet  
No surrender and I won't retreat  
This is my world  
Stand up now and face the sun  
Won't hide my tail or turn and run  
It's time to do what must be done  
Be a king when kingdom comes  
Girl, you can tell everybody  
Yeah, you can tell everybody  
Go ahead and tell everybody  
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man  
Girl, you can tell everybody  
Yeah, you can tell everybody  
Go ahead and tell everybody  
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man  
Yes, I am, yes, I am, yes, I am  
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man  
I'm the man  
Go ahead and tell everybody what I'm saying y'all  
I'm the man  
Go ahead and tell everybody what I'm saying y'all  
Girl, you can tell everybody  
Yeah, you can tell everybody  
Go ahead and tell everybody  
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man  
Girl, you can tell everybody  
Yeah, you can tell everybody  
Go ahead and tell everybody  
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man  
Girl, you can tell everybody  
Yeah, you can tell everybody  
Go ahead and tell everybody  
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man  
Girl, you can tell everybody  
Yeah, you can tell everybody  
Go ahead and tell everybody  
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man  
Yes, I am, yes, I am, yes, I am  
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
