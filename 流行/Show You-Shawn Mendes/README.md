### Show You歌词：

You can’t walk the streets at night  
You're way too short to get on this ride  
No I'm not, no I'm not, they're tryna tell me that I  
I gotta be home when the street lights glow?  
You can’t watch your TV show  
I will watch what I wanna watch  
No, won’t listen to you, do what I wanna do

And I will walk this road ahead  
One hundred miles on my hands  
Do I need to show you?  
Guess I gotta show you  
And if you don't believe me now  
I'll flip the whole world upside down  
Do I need to show you?  
Guess I gotta show you

Watch me swim across this lake  
Fly through the sky in my Superman cape  
Watch me walk across this wire  
Tip-toe through the coals of a blazing fire  
Watch me fly this kite in the rain  
I’ll jump rope with my ball and chain  
Come by and knock on my house of cards  
If it falls I'll rebuild it from the start  
I won’t listen to you, do what I wanna do

And I will walk this road ahead  
One hundred miles on my hands  
Do I need to show you?  
Guess I gotta show you  
And if you don't believe me now  
I'll flip the whole world upside down  
Do I need to show you?  
Guess I gotta show you

Do I really gotta show you now? Really, really, really, gotta show you now?  
Do I really gotta spell it out? I-T, I spelled it out  
If you really wanna see me now? Watch me walk across the clouds  
I don’t know what you heard about, listen to me yell it loud  
Do I really gotta show you now? Really, really, really, gotta show you now?  
Do I really gotta spell it out? I-T, I spelled it out  
If you really wanna see me now? Watch me walk across the clouds  
I don’t know what you heard about, see that door I'll knock it down

And I will walk this road ahead  
One hundred miles on my hands  
Do I need to show you?  
Guess I gotta show you  
And if you don't believe me now  
I'll flip the whole world upside down  
Do I need to show you?  
Guess I gotta show you

Do I really gotta show you now? Really, really, really, gotta show you now?  
Do I really gotta spell it out? I-T, I spelled it out  
If you really wanna see me now? Watch me walk across the clouds  
Do I need to show you? Guess I gotta show you
