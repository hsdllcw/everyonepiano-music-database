### California Love歌词：

California...  
California...knows how to party  
California...knows how to party  
In the citaaay of L.A.  
In the citaaay of good ol' Watts  
In the citaaay, the city of Compton.  
We keep it rockin! We keep it rockin!  
Now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild west  
A state that's untouchable like Elliot Ness  
The track hits ya eardrum, like a slug to ya chest  
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex  
We in that sunshine state with a bomb ass hemp beat  
the state where ya never find a dance floor empty.  
And pimps be on a mission for them greens  
lean mean money-makin'-machines servin' fiends.  
I been in the game for ten years makin' rap tunes  
ever since honeys was wearin' sassoon.  
Now it's '95  
and they clock me and watch me  
diamonds shinin'  
lookin' like I robbed Liberace.  
It's all good, from Diego to tha Bay  
Your city is tha bomb if your city makin' pay  
Throw up a finger if ya' feel the same way  
Dre puttin' it down for California.  
California....knows how to party  
California....knows how to party  
In tha citaaay of LA  
In tha citaaay of good ol' Watts  
In the citaaay, the city of Compton.  
We Keep it Rockin'  
We Keep it Rockin'  
(Dre) Yeah, now make it shake! come on!  
Shake Shake it baby  
Shake Shake it, Shake it baby  
Shake Shake it, Shake it Cali(Shake it Cali)  
Shake Shake it baby  
Shake Shake it  
Shake Shake it mama  
Shake it Cali  
Out on bail fresh outta jail  
California dreamin'Soon as I stepped on the scene  
I'm hearin' hoochies screamin'.  
Fiendin' for money and alcohol  
the life of a west side playa'  
where cowards die, it's our ball  
Only in Cali where we riot now rallies are live and die.  
In L.A. we wearin' chucks not Ballies. (yea, that's right)  
Dressed in Locs and khaki suits  
and ride is what we do.  
Flossin' but have caution  
we can lie with other crews.  
Famous cause we program worldwide  
let'em recognize from Longbeach to Rose Grands  
Bumpin' and Grindin' like a slow jam  
it's west side  
so you know the Row won't bow down to no man.  
Say what you say  
but give me that bomb beat from Dre  
let me serenade the streets of L.A.  
From Oakland to Sacktown  
The Bay area in bag down  
California is where they put they mack down  
California.....knows how to party  
In tha Citaaay of LA  
In tha Citaaay of good ol' Watts  
In the citaaay, the city of Compton.  
We keep it Rockin'  
We Keep it Rockin'  
(Dre) yeah, yeah now make it shake...uuhhh  
Shake Shake it baby  
Shake Shake it  
Shake Shake it mama, Shake it Cali  
(Shake it Cali)  
Shake Shake it baby

Shake it Cali
