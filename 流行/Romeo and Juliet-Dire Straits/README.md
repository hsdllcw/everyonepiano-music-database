**Romeo and Juliet** 是英国摇滚乐队Dire
Straits所演唱的歌曲。乐队的音乐风格受很多音乐风格的影响，包括爵士，乡村音乐及蓝调，比较接近于摇滚这个大范畴内的beat music（节奏音乐）。
乐队的音乐极简化，与乐队成立时期是大热门的朋克摇滚相去甚远。他们的音乐是复古酒吧摇滚的产物，然而当时酒吧摇滚是积极向上，赞扬美好时期，乐队的音乐却是悲伤的。尽管是这种奇怪的摇滚风格，
_Dire Straits_ 却成为世界上最成功的商业摇滚乐队之一。

### Romeo and Juliet歌词：

A lovestruck romeo sing a streetsuss serenade  
Laying everybody low with a lovesong that he made  
Finds a convenient street light steps out of the shade  
Says something like you and me babe how about it?  
Juliet says hey it's romeo you nearly gimme a heart attack  
He's underneath the window she's singing hey la my boyfriend's back  
You shouldn't come around here singing up at people like that  
Anyway what you gonna do about it?  
Juliet the dice was loaded from the start  
And I bet and you exploded into my heart  
And I forget the movie song  
When you gonna realise it was just that the time was wrong juliet?  
Come up on different streets they both were streets of shame  
Both dirty both mean yes and the dream was just the same  
And I dreamed your dream for you and now your dream is real  
How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?  
When you can fall for chains of silver you can fall for chains of gold  
You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold  
You promised me everything you promised me thick and thin  
Now you just say oh romeo yeah you know I used to have a scene with him  
Juliet when we made love you used to cry  
You said I love you like the stars above and I love you till I die  
There's a place for us you know the movie song  
When you gonna realise it was just that the time was wrong juliet?  
I can't do the talk like they talk on the TV  
And I can't do a love song like the way it's meant to be  
I can't do everything but I'd do anything for you  
I can't do anything except be in love you  
And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be  
And all I do is keep th beat and bad company  
All I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme  
Julie I'd do the stars with you any time  
Juliet when we made love you used to cry  
You said I love you like the stars above I'll love you till I die  
And there's a place for us you know the movie song  
When you gonna realise it was just that the time was wrong juliet?  
finds that streetlight steps out of the shade  
Says something like you and me babe how about it?
