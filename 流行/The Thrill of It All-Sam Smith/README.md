### The Thrill of It All歌词：

I regret that I told the world  
That you were with me  
And I regret how I showed the world  
That you were pretty  
I never thought I'd learn so much  
So much from being lonely  
But I guess I didn't learn enough  
Cause now you won't hold me  
I guess I got lost in the moment  
I guess I got lost in the fall  
I guess I got lost in your heartbeat  
In the thrill of it all  
And I guess you were godd**n perfect  
Cause every single time you call  
I remind myself of what I lost that night  
My love  
In the thrill of it all  
In the thrill of it all  
Even though we weren't in love  
It was far from lust  
Yeah you were beautiful  
But in you I could trust  
Others they warned my heart  
They said I would lose fast  
They say that you were stopping ground  
And soon to be my past  
I guess I got lost in the moment  
I guess I got lost in the fall  
I guess I got lost in your heartbeat  
In the thrill of it all  
And I guess you were godd**n perfect  
Cause every single time you call  
I remind myself of what I lost that night  
My love  
In the thrill of it all  
In the thrill of it all  
And I guess you were godd**n perfect  
Cause every single time you call  
I remind myself of what I lost that night  
My love  
I remind myself of what I lost that night  
My love  
I remind myself of what I lost that night  
My love  
In the thrill of it all
