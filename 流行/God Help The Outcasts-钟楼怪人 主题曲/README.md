### God Help The Outcasts歌词：

I don't know if You can hear me  
Or if You're even there  
I don't know if You would listen  
To a gypsy's prayer

Yes, I know I'm just an outcast  
I shouldn't speak to You  
Still I see Your face and wonder  
Were You once an outcast too?

God help the outcasts  
Hungry from birth  
Show them the mercy  
They don't find on earth

The lost and forgotten  
They look to You still  
God help the outcasts  
Or nobody will

I ask for wealth, I ask for fame  
I ask for glory to rise on my name  
I ask for all I can possess  
I ask for God and the angels to bless me

I ask for nothing  
I can get by  
But I know so many  
Less lucky than I

God help the outcasts  
The poor and downtrod  
I thought we all were  
The children of God

I don't know if there's a reason  
Why some are blessed, some not  
Why the few You seem to favor  
They fear us, flee us, try not to see us

God help the outcasts  
The tattered, the torn  
Seeking an answer  
To why they were born

Winds of misfortune  
Have blown them about  
You made the outcasts  
Don't cast them out

The poor and unlucky  
The weak and the odd  
I thought they all were  
The children of God
