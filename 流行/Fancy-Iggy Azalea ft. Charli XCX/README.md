### Fancy歌词：

First things first, I'm the realest  
Drop this and let the whole world feel it  
And I'm still in the Murda Bizness  
I can hold you down, like I'm givin' lessons in physics  
You should want a bad bitch like this  
Drop it low and pick it up just like this  
Cup of Ace, cup of Goose, cup of Cris  
High heels, somethin' worth a half a ticket on my wrist  
Takin' all the liquor straight, never chase that  
Rooftop like we bringin' '88 back  
Bring the hooks in, where the bass at?  
Champagne spillin', you should taste that  
I'm so fancy, you already know  
I'm in the fast lane, from L.A. to Tokyo  
I'm so fancy, can't you taste this gold?  
Remember my name, 'bout to blow-oh-oh-oh  
I said baby, I do this, I thought that, you knew this  
Can't stand no haters and honest, the truth is  
And my flow retarded, each beat dear departed  
Swagger on stupid, I can't shop at no department  
Better get my money on time, if it ain't bout money, decline  
And swear I meant that there so much that I give that line a rewind  
So get my money on time, if it ain't bout money, decline  
I just can't worry 'bout no haters, gotta stay on my grind  
Now tell me, who that, who that? That do that, do that?  
Put that paper over all, I thought you knew that, knew that  
I be that I-G-G-Y, put my name in bold  
I been working, I'm up in here with some change to throw  
I'm so fancy, you already know  
I'm in the fast lane, from L.A. to Tokyo  
I'm so fancy, can't you taste this gold?  
Remember my name, 'bout to blow-oh-oh-oh  
Trash the hotel, let's get drunk on the minibar  
Make the phone call, feels so good getting what I want  
Yeah, keep on turning it up  
Chandelier swinging, we don't give a fuck  
Film star, yeah, I'm deluxe  
Classic, expensive, you don't get to touch, aow!  
Still stunting, how you love that?  
Got the whole world asking how I does that  
Hot girl, hands off, don't touch that  
Look at it, I bet you wishing you could clutch that  
That's just the way you like it, huh?  
And so good, he's just wishing he could bite it, huh?  
Never turn down nothing, slayin' these hoes  
Gold trigger on the gun like  
I'm so fancy, you already know  
I'm in the fast lane, from L.A. to Tokyo  
I'm so fancy, can't you taste this gold?  
Remember my name, 'bout to blow-oh-oh-oh  
Who that, who that, I-G-G-Y  
That do that, do that, I-G-G-Y  
Who that, who that, I-G-G-Y  
(Blow-oh-oh-oh)  
Who that, who that, I-G-G-Y  
That do that, do that, I-G-G-Y  
Who that, who that, I-G-G-Y  
(Blow-oh-oh-oh)
