**Wait Wait Wait** 是中国内地男歌手蔡徐坤第五首原创作品，由蔡徐坤包揽词曲创作、音乐制作，于2018年8月23日发行。

这是一首曲风混合了Dance和Electronic
Soul的流行单曲，编曲中的midi是利用人声替代乐器唱出来的，旋律充满迷幻氛围，副歌部分的高频率鼓点紧凑，瞬间带领听者进入歌曲情绪。同时带来反差感的还有和声的设计，若隐若现的女声穿插，展现出蔡徐坤的个人才华和创意。虽然这是一首关于爱情的歌曲，但蔡徐坤没有将立意局限于此，而是将自己对人生和孤独的理解尽数表达。

这首充满丰富故事性的《 _Wait Wait Wait_
》有着如诉的低吟浅唱，也有着刻意轻快的编曲，在感性中多了一点性感的顽皮。蔡徐坤在歌中用了极具个人魅力的唱腔，在纯粹男声里，他给内里晦涩伤感的歌词配上了强烈抓耳的旋律，主旋律与和声分别歌颂着爱与厌的对立

同时，网站还为大家提供了《[没有意外](Music-10117-没有意外-释放内心独白.html "没有意外")》的曲谱下载

### Wait Wait Wait歌词：

Wait Wait Wait  
All I do is wait wait wait  
You're the one I'm waiting for  
Weight weight weight  
Carrying the weight weight weight  
Is better than to let you go  
This space, our place  
This room is never gonna feel the same  
Up late, Too late  
To say I shoulda done it differently  
I hate that I miss you  
I'd stop if I could  
All our nights, Were spent in ecstasy  
So I can't forget you  
As much as I should  
All my days… I miss you next to me  
Wait Wait Wait  
All I do is wait wait wait  
You're the one I'm waiting for  
Weight weight weight  
Carrying the weight weight weight  
Is better than to let you go  
Two feet, One dance  
Distance, The devil walked in between  
Woke up, Broke down  
Oh how'd you'd ever do that to me  
I hate that I miss you  
I'd stop if I could  
All our nights, Were spent in ecstasy  
So I can't forget you  
As much as I should  
All my days… I miss you next to me  
Wait Wait Wait  
All I do is wait wait wait  
You're the one I'm waiting for  
Weight weight weight  
Carrying the weight weight weight  
Is better than to let you go  
Wait Wait Wait  
All I do is wait wait wait  
You're the one I'm waiting for  
Weight weight weight  
Carrying the weight weight weight  
Is better than to let you go  
Love, This love  
Is killin me to carry the weight of  
Us, This love  
Is killin me to carry the weight of  
Us, This love  
Is killin me, But it's better than to let you go  
Love, This love  
Is killin me to carry the weight of  
Us, This love  
Is killin me to carry the weight of  
Us, This love  
Is killin me, But it's better than to let you go  
Is better than to let you go  
Wait Wait Wait…
