### Heatstroke歌词：

Won't you please  
Slow it down  
I'm tryna talk to you darlin'  
Tryna walk with you darlin'  
And no no no no nobody stop it  
In love you got to believe  
Tell me how you feel right now  
'Cause all I wanna do is keep it real right now  
I'm tryna beat it up  
Beat pills right now  
Athletic in the sheets  
I got skills right now  
Red braids with some red baby hair  
Ballin' in that club ace of spades yeah  
Pop that bitch and spray it like 'raid'  
Yellow diamonds on you like a glass of lemonade  
Q-b I'll throw it  
Teeth white newport  
I want knees right choice  
80 thousand dollar birkin bag in the porsche  
I'm tryna with you till we on life support  
I'll split it with you if we get half of michael jordan  
No toilet tissue I shit niggas 'cause life's short  
No passport to go with me

Please let go and have a good time  
Have a good have a good time yeah
