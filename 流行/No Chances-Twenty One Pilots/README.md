### No Chances歌词：

We come for you no chances  
We come for you no chances  
In my house shoes in a foot race  
In this house we got feng shui  
Get the door to blow you away  
Flamethrower you a switchblade  
Feet planted on grip tape  
With my shoulders squared and my back straight  
Got a good base and a loose tongue  
Notorious in the octagon  
We got people on the way  
We want you home in one piece now  
Run away run away  
We get bodies every day  
We want you home in one piece now  
We come for you no chances  
We come for you no chances  
How&apos;d you get the location  
Put together pieces  
The say they sell the information  
In those terms of agreement  
We spent some weekends on the grind  
Surveillances outside we see when you arrive  
Ride or die my son  
Spent some weekends on the grind  
Surveillances outside we see when you arrive  
Ride or die my son  
We got people on the way  
We want you home in one piece now  
Run away run away  
We get bodies every day  
We want you home in one piece now  
We got people on the way  
We want you home in one piece now  
Run away run away  
We get bodies every day  
We want you home in one piece now  
We come for you no chances  
We come for you no chances  
We-we-we
