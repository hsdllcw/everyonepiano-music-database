**The Blackest Day** 是美国创作女歌手Lana Del
Rey演唱的一首歌曲，收录在其第三张录音室专辑《Honeymoon》中。《Honeymoon》的出现，正像她及时而至的成熟宣言。整张专辑中的14首歌曲，犹如组成的一部爱情长诗，其中的内容就好像一个痴恋女子说服爱人，一同逃离现状去度“蜜月”的故事。拉娜•德雷标志性的低音复古唱腔：慵懒、空灵、凄迷、哀艳、幽怨、怅惘的气息愈发令人着迷。这一切都让人欣喜，这一次，拉娜•德雷向乐迷展现的是一个更本色的“自我”形象。

### The Blackest Day歌词：

Carry me home, got my blue nail polish on  
It's my favorite color and my favorite tone of song  
I don't really wanna break up, we got it going on  
It's what you gathered from our talk, but you were wrong

It's not easy for me to talk about  
I have heavy heart-strings  
I'm not simple, it's trigonometry  
It's hard to express  
I can't explain

Ever since my baby went away  
It's been the blackest day, it's been the blackest day  
All I hear is Billie Holiday  
It's all that I play  
It's all that I play

Because I'm going deeper and deeper (deeper)  
Harder and harder (harder)  
Getting darker and darker  
Looking for love  
In all the wrong places  
Oh my God  
In all the wrong places  
Oh my God

Carry me home, got my new car and my gun  
Wind in my hair, holding your hand, listen to our song  
Carry me home, don't wanna talk about the things to come  
Just put your hands up in the air, the radio on  
Cause there's nothing for us to talk about  
Like the future and those things  
Cause there's nothing for me to think about  
Now that he's gone, I can't feel nothing

Ever since my baby went away  
It's been the blackest day, it's been the blackest day  
All I hear is Billie Holiday  
It's all that I play  
It's all that I play

Because I'm going deeper and deeper (deeper)  
Harder and harder (harder)  
Getting darker and darker  
Looking for love  
In all the wrong places  
Oh my God  
In all the wrong places  
Oh my God

You should've known better  
Than to have, to let her  
Get you under her spell of the weather  
I got you where I want you  
You're deader than ever  
And falling for forever  
I'm playing head games with you  
Got you where I want you  
I got you, I got you  
I got you where I want you now

Ever since my baby went away  
It's been the blackest day, it's been the blackest day  
All I hear is Billie Holiday  
It's all that I play  
It's all that I play

It's not one of those phases I'm going through  
Or just a song, it's not one of them  
I'm on my own  
On my own  
On my own again  
I'm on my own again  
I'm on my own again  
I'm on my own again
