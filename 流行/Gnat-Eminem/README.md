### Gnat歌词：

Yeah yeah sick  
d.a. got that d**e  
They say these bars are like COVID  
Bars are like COVID what  
You get 'em right off the bat  
You get 'em right off the bat yeah  
Infected with SARS and Corona  
Infected with SARS and Corona  
Like you took a bite off of that  
You took a bite off of that d**n  
And it goes from martian to human  
From martian to human yeah  
That's how the virus attacks  
That's how the virus attacks  
They come at me with machine guns  
At me with machine guns brr  
Like trying to fight off a gnat  
Still stackin' my chips h*es  
Higher than Shaq on his tiptoes  
Atop the Empire State Buildin'  
This s**t is like child's play children  
I will anni-nihilate kill them  
I'll f**k around and pile eight million  
Dead little juveniles wait chill then  
I'll await my trial date 'til then  
What  
Ain't nothin' you say could ever trump  
Nah  
Mic pencil get killed  
Yeah  
If you're hypersensitive I wasn't referencin' the vice president chill  
Chill  
I mean my penmanship at times tends to get ill  
Violence but with skill  
That's why I hence when I write ends up  
With the mic and pencil gettin' killed  
Haha yeah hold up  
And I'm still ride or die for the squad  
Yeah  
So you know which side that I'm on  
If a battle line's ever drawn but if I get involved  
It'll be like K9's in a brawl  
But not similar to Mike Vick at all  
'Cause even if I don't have a dog in the fight  
They ain't never gonna get rid of the fight in the dog  
Fight in the dog  
Got stripes like a tiger so you might get mauled  
A mic in the palms  
Like claws I can swing right for your jaw  
And rip it off with one swipe of the paw  
B***h you still on my d**k or nah  
Nah  
If I suck your wife is a straw  
Straw  
I'm sick and I'm not gonna cover my mouth next time that I cough 'cause  
They say these bars are like COVID  
Bars are like COVID what  
You get 'em right off the bat  
You get 'em right off the bat yeah  
Infected with SARS and Corona  
Infected with SARS and Corona  
Like you took a bite off of that  
You took a bite off of that d**n  
And it goes from martian to human  
From martian to human yeah  
That's how the virus attacks  
That's how the virus attacks  
They come at me with machine guns  
At me with machine guns brr  
Like trying to fight off a gnat  
Like trying to fight off a gnat yeah yeah  
And d.a. got that d**e he sends to me  
Uh-huh  
It's like pneumonia symptoms and contracting COVID instantly  
Which is what separates my flow from theirs  
So that no one gets even close to this to pose a risk to me  
So vocalistically  
What  
That's social distancing  
Yeah  
Flow going viral you best stay strapped  
With that Lysol and get way back  
Shh  
Get that Pine-Sol and that Ajax  
'Cause this dry cough is just like football umpires callin' a playback  
B***h back the f**k up like fifteen yards  
These rhymes call for a face mask  
Face mask  
'Nother fourteen-day quarantine they're cordoning off everything  
This s**t lookin' like a horror scene like me metaphorically  
D**n  
'Cause them stay-at-home orders seem  
Like they just keep getting more extreme  
Who knows when this nightmare will end  
Marilyn  
Like Monroe Norma Jean  
Norma Jean  
Still got that h****n lyrical drip with that morphine and that Thorazine  
'Cause I'm so f**kin' d**e  
D**e  
And you're a fiend  
And that's the one thing that hasn't changed  
Nope  
For some semblance of normalcy  
But I might need that Hydrochloroquine 'cause I got that  
Yeah  
The Dark Horse I'm a knight-mare  
Mom fed me Valium like air  
Mmm  
Thought that's why they called it a high chair  
Woah  
I got a contact like eyewear  
Woah  
Wait a minute b***h let me lie here  
Uh  
20/20 hindsight in my side mirror  
Every year you drop the ball like Times Square  
My hair trigger whenever I get an idea's  
Like f**k now my name rings out like a sponge mop  
And my drip was a drop  
In the bucket so that gun shot  
You just heard just now in that one spot  
Just came from the nine mil' that I just got  
That's big bucks and I got a full money clip and I'm loaded  
I ain't even mean to go the f**k off  
And I'm still totally inappropriate with an opiate  
Groping it while I'm holding it like a trophy  
I'm hoping a little c*****e'll get me OD'in'  
Woah everything is slow I begin to floating  
I know that I'm getting loaded the pen exploded  
Hiroshima with the flows a utopia  
With the d**e I'm an OG I'm like the G.O.A.T.  
Here to get your goat little bit of sodium it's assault  
A salt  
When I'm at the podium at your throat holy camoly  
I'm in the zone with the s**t I'm on  
Get Imodium and a commode because nobody's even close  
You're petroleum to plutonium you're a phony  
I'm at the crib with your ho  
Got her at the pole like voting with no clothing  
Stripped down to a toe ring and here we go with the gloating  
I've got my nose in the air like a Boeing  
Then I got into a little bit of an argument with her  
So I took a little lick of a Klonopin at dinner  
Then I hit her with the motherf**king ottoman and bit her  
Then I shot her in the liver  
Delivered her to the bottom of the river  
Oh  
But I'm probably gon' jump in the water with her  
With a wad of money 'cause I got a lot of it  
And when it come to drippin'  
I be soppin' like a hundred mile an hour  
Never runnin' out of either one of 'em I gotta get it 'cause  
They say these bars are like COVID  
Bars are like COVID what  
You get 'em right off the bat  
You get 'em right off the bat yeah  
Infected with SARS and Corona  
Infected with SARS and Corona  
Like you took a bite off of that  
You took a bite off of that d**n  
And it goes from martian to human  
From martian to human yeah  
That's how the virus attacks  
That's how the virus attacks  
They come at me with machine guns  
At me with machine guns brr  
It's like trying to fight off a gnat  
Fight off a gnat
