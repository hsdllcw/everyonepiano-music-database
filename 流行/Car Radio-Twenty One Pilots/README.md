### Car Radio歌词:

I ponder of something great  
My lungs will fill and then deflate  
They fill with fire  
Exhale desire  
I know it's dire  
My time today

I have these thoughts  
So often I ought  
To replace that slot  
With what I once bought  
'Cause somebody stole  
My car radio  
And now I just sit in silence

Sometimes quiet is violent  
I find it hard to hide it  
My pride is no longer inside  
It's on my sleeve  
My skin will scream  
Reminding me of  
Who I killed inside my dream  
I hate this car that I'm driving  
There's no hiding for me  
I'm forced to deal with what I feel  
There is no distraction to mask what is real  
I could pull the steering wheel

I have these thoughts  
So often I ought  
To replace that slot  
With what I once bought  
'Cause somebody stole  
My car radio  
And now I just sit in silence

I ponder of something terrifying  
'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind  
I find over the course of our human existence  
One thing consists of consistence  
And it's that we're all battling fear  
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here  
Oh my,  
Too deep  
Please stop thinking  
I liked it better when my car had sound

There are things we can do  
But from the things that work there are only two  
And from the two that we choose to do  
Peace will win  
And fear will lose  
There's faith and there's sleep  
We need to pick one please because  
Faith is to be awake  
And to be awake is for us to think  
And for us to think is to be alive  
And I will try with every rhyme  
To come across like I am dying  
To let you know you need to try to think

I have these thoughts  
So often I ought  
To replace that slot  
With what I once bought  
'Cause somebody stole  
My car radio  
And now I just sit in silence

(Oooh) [x4]

(Oooh) [x6 & repeats in background]  
And now I just sit in silence [x2]  
And now I just sit

And now I just sit in silence [x3]  
And now I just sit

I ponder of something great  
My lungs will fill and then deflate  
They fill with fire  
Exhale desire  
I know it's dire  
My time today

I have these thoughts  
So often I ought  
To replace that slot  
With what I once bought  
'Cause somebody stole  
My car radio  
And now I just sit in silence
