If I Could Turn Back Time歌词：

  

If I could turn back time  
If I could find a way I'd take back those words that hurt you and you'd stay

I don't know why I did the things I did I don't know why I said the things I
said  
Pride's like a knife it can cut deep inside  
Words are like weapons they wound sometimes.

I didn't really mean to hurt you I didn't wanna see you go I know I made you
cry, but baby

[Chorus:]  
If I could turn back time  
If I could find a way  
I'd take back those words that hurt you  
And you'd stay  
If I could reach the stars  
I'd give them all to you  
Then you'd love me, love me  
Like you used to do

If I could turn back time

My world was shattered I was torn apart  
Like someone took a knife and drove it deep in my heart  
You walked out that door I swore that I didn't care  
But I lost everything darling then and there

Too strong to tell you I was sorry  
Too proud to tell you I was wrong  
I know that I was blind, and ooh...

[Chorus]

Ooohh

If I could turn back time  
If I could turn back time  
If I could turn back time  
ooh baby

I didn't really mean to hurt you  
I didn't want to see you go  
I know I made you cry  
Ooohh

[Chorus #2]  
If I could turn back time  
If I could find a way  
I'd take back those words that hurt you  
If I could reach the stars  
I'd give them all to you  
Then you'd love me, love me  
Like you used to do

If I could turn back time (turn back time)  
If I could find a way (find a way)  
Then baby, maybe, maybe  
You'd stay

[to fade]  
Reach the stars  
If I could reach the stars
