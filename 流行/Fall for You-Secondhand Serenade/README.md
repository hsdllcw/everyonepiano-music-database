**Fall for You双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_  
Fall for You_ 是原声摇滚乐队Secondhand Serenade的歌曲。Secondhand
Serenade，直译的话是二手小夜曲，不过虽然叫乐队，但实际上，所有的工作都是John
Vesely一个人完成的，他负责唱歌演凑吉它和钢琴。所以Secondhand Serenade即是指John
Vesely，他1980年2月6日生于加尼福尼亚的门洛帕克市，有一个妻子有一个小孩。08年和平分手，正与Veronica Ballestrini 热恋中。

  
Secondhand
Serenade的音乐具有Emo的速度感和旋律感，但歌曲意境却没有大多数Emo乐队那么怪异、阴郁。对于一个摇滚男歌手来说，他的嗓音还略显稚嫩，可以说是介于男人与男孩之间，算是特色之一。另外Secondhand
Serenade歌曲都比较流行化，对于看重旋律的摇滚乐迷应该很受用。

### Fall for You歌词：

The best thing about tonight's that we're not fighting  
Could it be that we have been this way before  
I know you don't think that I am trying  
I know you're wearing thin down to the core

But hold your breath  
Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you  
Over again  
Don't make me change my mind  
Or I won't live to see another day  
I swear it's true  
Because a girl like you is impossible to find  
You're impossible to find

This is not what I intended  
I always swore to you I'd never fall apart  
You always thought that I was stronger  
I may have failed  
But I have loved you from the start  
Oh

But hold your breath  
Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you  
Over again  
Don't make me change my mind  
Or I won't live to see another day  
I swear it's true  
Because a girl like you is impossible to find  
It's impossible

So breathe in so deep  
Breathe me in  
I'm yours to keep  
And hold onto your words  
'Cause talk is cheap  
And remember me tonight  
When you're asleep

Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you  
Over again  
Don't make me change my mind  
Or I won't live to see another day  
I swear it's true  
Because a girl like you is impossible to find  
Tonight will be the night that I will fall for you  
Over again  
Don't make me change my mind  
Or I won't live to see another day  
I swear it's true  
Because a girl like you is impossible to find  
You're impossible to find
