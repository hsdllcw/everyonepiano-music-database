### I Was Made for Loving You歌词：

[Tori Kelly:]  
A dangerous plan, just this time  
A stranger's hand clutched in mine  
I'll take this chance, so call me blind  
I've been waiting all my life  
Please don't scar this young heart  
Just take my hand

[Chorus - Tori Kelly:]  
I was made for loving you  
Even though we may be hopeless hearts just passing through  
Every bone screaming I don't know what we should do  
All I know is, darling, I was made for loving you

[Ed Sheeran:]  
Hold me close through the night  
Don't let me go, we'll be alright  
Touch my soul and hold it tight  
I've been waiting all my life  
I won't scar your young heart  
Just take my hand

[Chorus - Tori Kelly & Ed Sheeran:]  
Cause I was made for loving you  
Even though we may be hopeless hearts just passing through  
Every bone screaming I don't know what we should do  
All I know is, darling, I was made for loving you

Please don't go, I've been waiting so long  
Oh, you don't even know me at all  
But I was made for loving you

[Chorus - Tori Kelly & Ed Sheeran:]  
I was made for loving you  
Even though we may be hopeless hearts just passing through  
Every bone screaming I don't know what we should do  
All I know is, darling, I was made for loving you
