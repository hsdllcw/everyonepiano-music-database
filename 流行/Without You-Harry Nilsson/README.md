### Without You歌词：

No, I can't forget this evening  
我无法忘记今晚  
Or, your face as you were leaving  
当你离去时的脸庞  
But I guess that's just the way the story goes  
但我想那就是故事的结局  
You always smile  
你一直保持著笑容  
But in your eyes your sorrow shows  
但眼里却流露著哀伤  
Yes, it shows  
没错，那是哀伤  
No, I can't forget tomorrow  
我无法忘记明日  
When I think of all my sorrow  
当我想到自己的哀愁  
When I had you there, but then I let you go  
我拥有了你，却又让你溜走  
And now it's only fair that I should let you know  
现在我只想让你知道  
What you should know  
一些你该知道的事  
I can't live, if living is without you  
我活不下去，如果生命中失去了你  
I can't live, I can't give anymore  
我活不下去，我再也无法付出  
I can't live, if living is without you

Well I can't forget this evening

But I guess that's just the way the story goes
