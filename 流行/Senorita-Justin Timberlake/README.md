### Senorita歌词：

Ladies and gentlemen  
It's my pleasure to introduce to you  
He's a friend of mine, yes, yes I am  
And he goes by the name, Justin

All the way from Memphis, Tennessee  
And he's got something special for y'all tonight  
He's gonna sing a song for y'all about this girl  
Come in right here?  
Yeah, come on

On that sunny day  
Didn't know I'd meet  
Such a beautiful girl  
Walking down the street

Seen those bright brown eyes  
With tears coming down  
She deserves a crown  
But where is it now? Mama, listen

Senorita, I feel for you  
You deal with things that you don't have to  
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm  
But you could feel this real love  
If you just lay in my

Running fast in my mind  
Girl, won't you slow it down?  
If we carry on this way  
This thing might leave the ground

How would you like to fly?  
That's how my queen should ride  
But you still deserve the crown  
Well, hasn't it been found?  
Mama, listen

Senorita, I feel for you  
You deal with things, that you don't have to  
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm  
But you could feel this real love  
If you just lay in my

Ah, ah, arms  
Ah, ah, arms  
Ah, ah, arms  
Ah, ah, arms

When I look into your eyes  
I see something that money can't buy  
And I know if you give us a try  
I'll work harder for you, girl  
And no longer will you ever have to cry

Senorita, I feel for you  
You deal with things that you don't have to  
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm  
But you could feel this real love  
If you just lay in my

Ah, ah, arms  
Ah, ah, arms  
Ah, ah, arms  
Ah, ah, arms

When I look into your eyes  
I see something that money can't buy  
And I know if you give us a try  
I'll work harder for you, girl, you won't have to cry

Now, listen, I wanna try some right now  
See they don't do this anymore  
I'ma sing something  
And I want the guys to sing with me, they go

It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?  
And then the ladies go  
I don't no but I'm thinking 'bout really leaving with you

Guys sing  
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?  
And ladies  
I don't no but I'm thinking 'bout really leaving with you

Feels good, don't it? Come on  
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?  
Yeah, ladies  
I don't no but I'm thinking 'bout really leaving with you

Sing it one more time  
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?  
Ladies  
I don't no but I'm thinking 'bout really leaving with you

It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?  
Ladies  
I don't know but I'm thinking 'bout really leaving with you?

Gentlemen, good night  
Ladies, good morning  
And that's it
