### With You歌词：

I need you, boo, I gotta see you, boo  
And the hearts all over the world tonight  
Said the hearts all over the world tonight  
And I need you, boo, I gotta see you, boo  
And the hearts all over the world tonight  
Said the hearts all over the world tonight  
Hey, little mama, ooh, you're a stunner  
Hot little figure, yes, you a winner  
And I'm so glad to be yours  
You're a class all your own  
And, ooh, little cutie, when you talk to me  
I swear the whole world stops, you're my sweetheart  
And I'm so glad that you're mine  
You are one of a kind  
And you mean to me what I mean to you  
And together, baby, there is nothing we won't do  
Cause if I got you I don't need money  
I don't need cars, girl, you're my all  
And, oh, I'm into you  
And, girl, no one else would do  
Cause with every kiss and every hug  
You make me fall in love  
And now I know I can't be the only one  
I bet there's hearts all over the world tonight  
With the love of their life  
Who feel what I feel when I'm  
With you, with you, with you  
With you, with you, girl  
With you, with you, with you  
With you, with you, oh girl  
I don't want nobody else  
Without you there's no one left and  
You're like Jordan's on Saturday  
I gotta have you and I cannot wait now  
Hey, little shorty, say you care for me  
You know I care for you, you know that I'll be true  
You know that I won't lie, you know that I will try  
To be your everything, yeah  
Cause if I got you I don't need money  
I don't need cars, girl, you're my all  
And, oh, I'm into you  
And, girl, no one else would do  
Cause with every kiss and every hug  
You make me fall in love  
And now I know I cant be the only one  
I bet its hearts all over the world tonight  
With the love of their life  
Who feel what I feel when I'm  
With you, with you, with you  
With you, with you, oh  
With you, with you, with you  
With you, with you, yeah  
And I will never try to deny  
That you are my whole life  
Cause if you ever let me go I would die  
So I won't front  
I don't need another woman  
I just need your all or nothing  
Cause if I got that then I'll be straight  
Baby, you're the best part of my day  
I need you, boo, I gotta see you, boo  
And the hearts all over the world tonight  
Said the hearts all over the world tonight  
They need they boo, they gotta see they boo  
Said the hearts all over the world tonight  
Hearts all over the world tonight  
And, oh, I'm into you  
And, girl, no one else would do  
Cause with every kiss and every hug  
You make me fall in love  
And now I know I cant be the only one  
I bet its hearts all over the world tonight  
With the love of their life  
Who feel what I feel when I'm  
With you, with you, with you  
With you, with you, girl  
With you, with you, with you  
With you, with you, oh  
With you, with you, with you  
With you, with you, with you  
With you, with you, with you  
With you, with you, yeah.
