### Hollywood's Bleeding歌词：

Hollywood's bleeding vampires feedin'  
Darkness turns to dust  
Everyone's gone but no one's leavin'  
Nobody left but us  
Tryna chase a feelin' but we'll never feel it  
Ridin' on the last train home  
Dyin' in our sleep we're living out a dream  
We only make it out alone  
I just keep on hopin' that you call me  
You say you wanna see me but you can't right now  
You never took the time to get to know me  
Was scared of losin' somethin' that we never found  
We're running out of reasons but we can't let go  
Yeah Hollywood is bleeding but we call it home  
Outside the winter sky turnin' grey  
City up in smoke it's only ash when it rains  
Howl at the moon and go to sleep in the day  
Love for everybody 'til the drugs fade away  
In the mornin' blocking out the sun with the shades  
She gotta check her pulse and tell herself that she okay  
It seem like dying young is an honor  
But who'd be at my funeral I wonder  
I go out and all they eyes on me  
I show out do you like what you see  
And now they closin' in on me  
Let 'em sharpen all they teeth  
This is more than I can handle  
Blood in my Lambo'  
Wish I could go oh I'm losin' ho-ope  
I light a candle some Palo Santo  
For all these demons wish I could just go on  
I just keep on hopin' that you call me  
You say you wanna see me but you can't right now  
You never took the time to get to know me  
Was scared of losin' somethin' that we never found  
We're running out of reasons but we can't let go  
Yeah Hollywood is bleeding but we call it home
