### Bye Bye Baby歌词：

It wasn't just like a movie  
The rain didn't soak through my clothes down to my skin  
I'm driving away and I I guess you could say  
This is the last time I'll drive this way again  
Lost in the gray and I try to grab at the fray  
Cause I I still love you but I can't  
Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side  
Bye bye baby  
I want you back but it's come down to nothing  
And all I have is your sympathy  
Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me  
Bye bye baby  
Bye bye baby  
The picture frame is empty  
On the dresser vacant just like me  
I see you writing on the dash  
Then back to your hesitation  
I was so sure of everything  
Everything I thought we'd always have  
Guess I'm never doubted it  
Then the here and the now floods in  
Feels like I'm becoming a part of your past  
Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side  
Bye bye baby  
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing  
And all I have is your sympathy  
Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me  
Bye bye baby  
There's so much that I can't touch  
You're all I want but it's not enough this time  
And all the pages are just slipping through my hands  
And I'm so scared of how this ends  
Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side  
Bye bye baby  
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing  
And all I have is sympathy  
Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me  
Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side  
Bye bye baby  
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing  
And all I have is your sympathy  
Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me  
Oh you took me home I thought you were gonna keep me  
Bye bye baby  
Bye bye baby
