### Talk Me Down歌词：

I wanna sleep next to you  
But that's all I wanna do right now  
And I wanna come home to you  
But home is just a room full of my safest sounds  
Cause you know that I can't trust myself with my 3AM shadow  
I'd rather fuel a fantasy than deal with this alone

I wanna sleep next to you  
But that's all I wanna do right now  
So come over now and talk me down

I wanna hold hands with you  
But that's all I wanna do right now  
And I wanna get close to you  
Cause your hands and lips still know their way around  
And I know I like to draw that line, when it starts to get too real  
But the less time that I spend with you, the less you need to heal

I wanna sleep next to you  
But that's all I wanna do right now  
So come over now and talk me down  
(talk me down)

So if you don't mind, I'll walk that line  
Stuck on the bridge between us  
Gray areas and expectations  
But I'm not the one if we're honest, yeah  
But I wanna sleep next to you  
And I wanna come home to you  
I wanna hold hands with you  
I wanna be close to you

But I wanna sleep next to you  
And that's all I wanna do right now  
And I wanna come home to you  
But home is just a room full of my safest sounds  
So come over now and talk me down  
(talk me down)
