### Perfect Places歌词：

Every night, I live and die  
Feel the party to my bones  
Watch the wasters blow the speakers  
Spill my guts beneath the outdoor light  
It's just another graceless night  
I hate the headlines and the weather  
I'm 19 and I'm on fire  
But when we're dancing I'm alright  
It's just another graceless night  
Are you lost enough?  
Have another drink, get lost in us  
This is how we get notorious, oh  
'Cause I don't know  
If they keep tellin' you where to go  
I'll blow my brains out to the radio, oh  
All of the things we're taking  
'Cause we are young and we're ashamed  
Sends us to perfect places  
All of our heroes fading  
Now I can't stand to be alone  
Let's go to perfect places  
Every night, I live and die  
Meet somebody, take 'em home  
Let's kiss and then take off our clothes  
It's just another graceless night  
'Cause all of the things we're taking  
'Cause we are young and we're ashamed  
Sends us to perfect places  
All of our heroes fading  
Now I can't stand to be alone  
Let's go to perfect places  
All the nights spent off our faces  
Trying to find these perfect places  
What the fuck are perfect places anyway?  
All the nights spent off our faces  
Trying to find these perfect places  
What the fuck are perfect places anyway?  
All the nights spent off our faces  
Trying to find these perfect places  
What the fuck are perfect places anyway?
