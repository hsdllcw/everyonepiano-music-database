### It Takes Two歌词：

Is Mercury in retrograde or is that the excuse that I've always made  
'Cause I wanna blame you,  
But I can only blame myself

Yeah, it's easy to throw you under the bus  
I'll call you crazy, while I'm filling my cup  
I say these things to hurt you  
But I only hurt myself

Oh, I can only yake responsability for me  
It takes two, two sides to every story  
Not just you  
I can't keep ignoring  
I admit half of it, I'm not that innocent, oh yeah

It takes two, two sides to every story  
Not just me  
You can't keep ignoring  
But let me be first baby to say "I'm sorry"

I face my demons, yeah, I paid my dues  
I had to grow up, I wish you could too  
I wanted to save you, but I can only save myself

Oh, I can only be the changing one to see  
Yeah, I can see

It takes two, two sides to every story  
Not just you  
I can't keep ignoring  
I admit half of it, I'm not that innocent, oh yeah

It takes two, two sides to every story  
Not just me  
You can't keep ignoring  
But let me be first baby to say "I'm sorry"

I point my finger but it does me no good  
I look in the mirror and it tells me truth, yeah  
Why all these lessons always learned the hard way  
Is it too late to change

It takes two, two sides to every story  
Not just you  
I can't keep ignoring  
I admit half of it, I'm not that innocent, oh

It takes two, two sides to every story  
Not just me  
You can't keep ignoring  
But let me be first baby to say "I'm sorry"
