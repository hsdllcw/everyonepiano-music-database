### Iris英文歌词：

And I'd give up forever to touch you  
Cause I know that you feel me somehow  
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be  
And I don't want to go home right now  
And all I can taste is this moment  
And all I can breathe is your life  
Cause sooner or later it's over  
I just don't want to miss you tonight  
And I don't want the world to see me  
Cause I don't think that they'd understand  
When everything's made to be broken  
I just want you to know who I am  
And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming  
Or the moment of truth in your lies  
When everything seems like the movies  
Yeah you bleed just to know you're alive  
And I don't want the world to see me  
Cause I don't think that they'd understand  
When everything's made to be broken  
I just want you to know who I am  
I don't want the world to see me  
Cause I don't think that they'd understand  
When everything's made to be broken  
I just want you to know who I am  
I don't want the world to see me  
Cause I don't think that they'd understand  
When everything's made to be broken  
I just want you to know who I am  
I just want you to know who I am  
I just want you to know who I am  
I just want you to know who I am

### Iris中文歌词：

我愿永远放弃接近你  
我知道你能感受到我的存在  
你高在天堂而我将去地狱  
我不想现在回家  
此时我愿意体味  
我能呼吸的是你的生命  
迟早将会过去  
只是今晚我不想再失去你  
我不想让整个世界看到我  
我想他们不理解我  
当一切都将逝去  
我只想让你知道我是谁  
谎话被揭穿时  
不必抗争，不起易落泪的你  
当一切都如电影般  
你用鲜血证明你的存在  
我不想让整个世界看到我  
我想他们不理解我  
当一切都将逝去  
我只想让你知道我是谁  
我只想让你知道我是谁  
我只想让你知道我是谁  
我只想让你知道我是谁
