### House With No Mirrors歌词：

I'd be cooler I'd be smarter  
Probably be a better daughter  
I'd jump in a pool without thinkin' twice  
Take off my shirt like one of guys  
I would save a lot of money  
I would say when I was hungry  
I'd throw on some jeans not know the size  
Walk out the door and not wanna cry  
If I lived in a house with no mirrors  
Where the walls didn't talk back at me  
Maybe I'd dream a bit bigger  
If there was nothin' to see  
If I lived in a house with no mirrors  
Where the walls didn't pick me apart  
Maybe my skin would be thicker  
If I lived in a house with no mirrors  
I'd be louder I'd be honest  
Probably wouldn't be self-conscious  
I'd go to a party not care who was there  
Not spend an hour pickin' what to wear  
Would've never dyed my hair blonde  
I'd have s*x with all the lights on  
And I wouldn't pull away from his touch  
If he said I was pretty I'd think that I was  
If I lived in a house with no mirrors  
Where the walls didn't talk back at me  
Maybe I'd dream a bit bigger  
If there was nothin' to see  
If I lived in a house with no mirrors  
Where the walls didn't pick me apart  
Maybe my skin would be thicker  
If I lived in a house with no mirrors  
Wonder what I'd be like  
Maybe I'd sleep a little better at night  
Yeah I wonder what I'd be like  
If I  
If I lived in a house with no mirrors  
Where the walls didn't talk back at me  
Maybe I'd dream a bit bigger  
If there was nothin' to see  
If I lived in a house with no mirrors  
Where the walls didn't pick me apart  
Maybe my skin would be thicker  
If I lived in a house with no mirrors  
I wonder what I'd be like  
Yeah I wonder what I'd be like
