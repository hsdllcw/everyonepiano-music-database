### Born To Be Yours歌词：

I know I've given up  
A hundred times before  
But I know a miracle  
Is not something to ignore  
You take me for a fool  
You take me for a fool  
I never knew anybody 'til I knew you  
I never knew anybody 'til I knew you  
And I know when it rains oh it pours  
And I know I was born to be yours  
I never knew anybody 'til I knew you  
I never knew anybody 'til I knew you  
And I know when it rains oh it pours  
And I know I was born to be yours  
Are you the only one  
Lost in the millions  
Or are you my grain of sand  
That's blowing in the wind  
I never knew anybody 'til I knew you  
I never knew anybody 'til I knew you  
And I know when it rains oh it pours  
And I know I was born to be yours  
I never knew anybody 'til I knew you  
I never knew anybody 'til I knew you  
And I know when it rains oh it pours  
And I know I was born to be yours  
I was born to be yours  
I was born born born born  
I was born to be yours  
I was born born born  
I was born to be yours  
I was born born born born  
I was born to be yours  
Oh woah  
Oh woah hey  
Born to be yours  
I was born born born born  
I was born to be yours  
I was born born born  
I was born to be yours  
I was born born born born  
I was born to be yours oh woah
