Dirt歌词：

You get your hands in it, plant your roots in it  
Dusty head lights dance with your boots in it  
You write her name on it, spin your tires on it  
Build your corn field, whiskey bonfires on it  
You bet your life on it

[Chorus:]  
It’s that elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on  
That plowed-up ground that your dad damned his luck on  
That post-game party field you circle up on  
And when it rains you get stuck on  
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up  
The mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up  
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts  
Makes you wanna build ten percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

You mix some sweat with it, taking a shovel to it  
You stuck some crosses and some painted goal posts through it (damn)

You know you came from it and someday you’ll return to this...

[Chorus:]  
...elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on  
That plowed-up ground that your dad damned his luck on  
That post-game party field you circle up on  
And when it rains you get stuck on  
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up  
The mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up  
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts  
Makes you wanna build a ten percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

You know you came from it and someday you’ll return to this...

[Chorus:]  
...elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on  
That plowed-up ground that your dad damned his luck on  
That post-game party field you circle up on  
And when it rains you get stuck on  
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up  
The mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up  
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts  
Makes you wanna build a ten percent down white picket fence house on this dirt  
Makes you wanna build a ten percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

You know you came from it and someday you'll return to it
