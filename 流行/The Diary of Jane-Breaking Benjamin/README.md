**The Diary of Jane** 是美国摇滚乐队Breaking Benjamin所演唱的一首歌曲。该乐队现任成员有主唱兼节奏吉他手Ben
Burnley，主音吉他Aaron Fink，贝斯手Mark James Klepaski和鼓手Jeremy Hummel。

  
相比一般的Alternative Metal乐队，Breaking
Benjamin的旋律把握得要明显更为细致，而且歌曲中的chorus段也更易上口。在《Phobia》中，Breaking
Benjamin的这一优势表现的相当突出。主打单曲《 _The Diary of Jane_ 》就是Breaking
Benjamin乐队实力的最佳证明，而接下来的《Breath》也是一首旋律非常出色的可以单独打榜的单曲。

### The Diary of Jane歌词：

If I had to  
I would put myself right beside you  
So let me ask  
Would you like that?  
Would you like that?  
And I don't mind  
If you say this love is the last time  
So now I'll ask  
Do you like that?  
Do you like that?  
NO!!  
Something's getting in my way  
Something's just about to break  
I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane  
So tell me how it should be  
Try to find out what makes you tick  
As I lie down  
Sore and sick  
Do you like that?  
Do you like that?  
There's a fine line between love and hate  
And I don't mind  
Just let me say that I like that  
I like that  
Something's getting in my way  
Something's just about to break  
I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane  
As I burn another page  
As I look the other way  
I still try to find my place in the diary of Jane  
So tell me how it should be  
Desperate, I will crawl  
Waiting for so long  
No love, there is no love  
Die for anyone  
What have I become  
Something's getting in the way  
Something's just about to break  
I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane  
As I burn another page  
As I look the other way  
I still try to find my place  
In the diary of Jane
