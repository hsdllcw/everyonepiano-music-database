### Dinero歌词：

Oh I don't know I don't know  
No soy traficante  
Pero escucho corridos que juegan tomando tekate  
Ya dimelo antes  
Ya si quieres dinero lo siento no tengo  
She taking my dinero  
Taking my dinero  
She taking my dinero  
Taking my dinero  
She playing hella hard  
Playing for pesos  
She playing hella hard  
Playing for pesos  
I whip whip I'm rolling  
I got my money open  
She text me good morning  
Then I'm ready to go out and buy  
Anything that she like  
Get whatever's on her mind  
Spending money overtime oh my  
I wake myself with the sun of the morning  
I play myself with a stunner performance  
She take all my money and now she gone  
And I'm broke as a b**ch and I'm all alone yeah  
Trying to ball for this  
Wearing the same clothes yeah  
Trying to stay low yeah  
Looking for pesos yeah  
She taking my dinero  
Taking my dinero  
She taking my dinero  
Taking my dinero  
She playing hella hard  
Playing for pesos  
She playing hella hard  
Playing for pesos  
I'm with her rolling  
My heart is broken  
My money stolen  
My shawtys so bad  
But I'm ready to go out and buy  
Anything that she like  
Get whatever's on her mind  
Spending money overtime oh my  
She taking my dinero  
Taking my dinero  
She take my dinero  
Taking my dinero  
She playing hella hard  
She playing hella hard  
Then I'm ready to go out and buy  
Anything that she like
