**Accidentally In Love** 是摇滚组合Counting
Crows所演唱的歌曲。乐队成立于1993年，几乎是在1994年一夜成名的。他们以前混迹于一个不知名的歌厅。直到93年秋天，他们才推出首张专辑《August
& Everything After》。但是这张专辑却是用一种阴郁黯淡的整体风格来表现自己。主唱Adam
Duritz富于表现力的歌喉用来传达了一种郁闷乖僻的感觉，因此并未得到很多人的认可。

### Accidentally In Love歌词：

So she said what's the problem baby  
What's the problem I don't know  
Well maybe I'm in love (love)  
Think about it every time  
I think about it  
Can't stop thinking 'bout it  
How much longer will it take to cure this  
Just to cure it cause I can't ignore it if it's love (love)  
Makes me wanna turn around and face me but I don't know nothing 'bout love  
Come on, come on  
Turn a little faster  
Come on, come on  
The world will follow after  
Come on, come on  
Cause everybody's after love  
So I said I'm a snowball running  
Running down into the spring that's coming all this love  
Melting under blue skies  
Belting out sunlight  
Shimmering love  
Well baby I surrender  
To the strawberry ice cream  
Never ever end of all this love  
Well I didn't mean to do it  
But there's no escaping your love  
These lines of lightning  
Mean we're never alone,  
Never alone, no, no  
Come on, Come on  
Move a little closer  
Come on, Come on  
I want to hear you whisper  
Come on, Come on  
Settle down inside my love  
Come on, come on  
Jump a little higher  
Come on, come on  
If you feel a little lighter  
Come on, come on  
We were once  
Upon a time in love  
We're accidentally in love  
Accidentally in love (x7)  
Accidentally  
I'm In Love, I'm in Love,  
I'm in Love, I'm in Love,  
I'm in Love, I'm in Love,  
Accidentally (X 2)  
Come on, come on  
Spin a little tighter  
Come on, come on  
And the world's a little brighter  
Come on, come on  
Just get yourself inside her  
Love ...I'm in love
