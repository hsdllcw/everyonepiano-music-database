### God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen歌词：

God rest you merry, gentlemen,  
Let nothing you dismay,  
For Jesus Christ our Saviour  
Was born upon this day,  
To save us all from Satan's power  
When we were gone astray:  
O tidings of comfort and joy,  
comfort and joy,  
O tidings of comfort and joy.

In Bethlehem, in Jury,  
This blessed Babe was born,  
And laid within a manger  
Upon this blessed morn,  
The which His Mother Mary  
Did nothing take in scorn:  
O tidings …

From God our heavenly Father  
A blessèd angel came,  
And unto certain shepherds  
Brought tidings of the same,  
How that in Bethlehem was born  
The Son of God by name:  
O tidings …

The shepherds at those tidings  
Rejoicèd much in mind,  
And left their flocks a-feeding  
In tempest, storm and wind,  
And went to Bethlehem straightway,  
This blessèd Babe to find:  
O tidings …

But when to Bethlehem they came,  
Whereat this Infant lay,  
They found Him in a manger,  
Where oxen feed on hay;  
His mother Mary kneeling,  
Unto the Lord did pray:  
O tidings …

Now to the Lord sing praises,  
All you within this place,  
And with true love and brotherhood  
Each other now embrace;  
This holy tide of Christmas  
All others doth deface:  
O tidings …
