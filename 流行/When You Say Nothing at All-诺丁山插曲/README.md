### When You Say Nothing at All歌词：

It's amazing how you  
Can speak right to my heart.  
Without saying a word  
You can light up the dark.

Try as I may, I could never explain  
What I hear when you don't say a thing.

[Chorus:]  
The smile on your face  
Lets me know that you need me.  
There's a truth in your eyes  
Saying you'll never leave me.  
[Album version:] The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall.  
[Live version:] The touch of your hand says you'll catch me whenever I fall.  
You say it best when you say nothing at all.

All day long I can hear  
People talking out loud (oooh).  
But when you hold me near (you hold me near)  
You drown out the crowd (the crowd, the crowd).

Try as they may, they can never define  
What's been said between your heart and mine.

[Chorus:]  
The smile on your face  
Lets me know that you need me.  
There's a truth in your eyes  
Saying you'll never leave me.  
[Album version:] The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall.  
[Live version:] The touch of your hand says you'll catch me whenever I fall.  
[Album version:] You say it best (you say it best) when you say nothing at
all.  
[Live version:] 'Cause you say it best (you say it best) when you say nothing
at all.

[Chorus:]  
The smile on your face  
Lets me know that you need me.  
There's a truth in your eyes  
Saying you'll never leave me.  
[Album version:] The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall.  
[Live version:] The touch of your hand says you'll catch me whenever I fall.  
[Album version:] You say it best (you say it best) when you say nothing at
all.  
[Live version:] 'Cause you say it best (you say it best) when you say nothing
at all.

(You say it best when you say nothing at all.  
You say it best when you say nothing at all.)

That smile on your face,  
[Album version:] The truth in your eyes,  
[Live version:] The look in your eyes,  
The touch of your hand  
Lets me know that you need me.

(You say it best when you say nothing at all.  
You say it best when you say nothing at all.)

[Live version additional ending:]  
The smile on your face,  
The look in your eyes,  
The touch of your hand  
Lets me know that you need me.
