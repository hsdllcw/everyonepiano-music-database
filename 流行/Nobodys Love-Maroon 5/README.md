### Nobody's Love歌词：

You could make a grown man cry  
If you ever said "Goodbye"  
Never let you go oh oh oh I  
Never let you go oh oh oh I  
You could make a grown man cry  
If you ever left my side  
Never let you go oh oh oh I  
Never let you go oh oh oh I  
You're the only hand in my back pocket  
If you ever left I go pyschotic  
Heaven hear me cryin' cryin'  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Baby you're the key to my heart locket  
If you ever left never unlock it  
Lonely like an island island  
Ooh ooh ooh  
If my love ain't your love  
It's never gonna be nobody's love  
Never gonna need nobody's love but yours  
But yours  
If my love ain't your love  
It's never gonna be nobody's love  
Never gonna need nobody's trust but yours  
But yours  
You could make a grown man cry  
If you ever said "Goodbye"  
Never let you go oh oh oh I  
Never let you go oh oh oh I  
You could make a grown man cry  
If you ever left my side  
Never let you go oh oh oh I  
Never let you go oh oh oh I  
You're the only hand in my back pocket  
If you ever left I'd go pyschotic  
Heaven hear me cryin' cryin'  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Hit me like a d**g and I can't stop it  
Fit me like a glove and I can't knock it  
I ain't even lyin' lyin'  
Ooh ooh ooh  
If my love ain't your love  
It's never gonna be nobody's love  
Never gonna need nobody's love but yours  
Nobody's but yours  
If my love ain't your love  
It's never gonna be nobody's love  
Never gonna need nobody's trust but yours  
But yours  
If my love ain't your love then it's nobody's  
It's only yours only yours not just anybody's  
And if you ever leave then I'm never gon' want nobody  
Nobody's love  
If my love ain't your love then it's nobody's  
It's only yours only yours not just anybody's  
And if you ever leave then I'm never gon' want nobody  
Nobody's love  
Nobody's love  
Oh yeah  
If my love ain't your love  
It's never gonna be nobody's love  
Never gonna need nobody's love but yours  
No no but yours  
If my love ain't your love  
It's never gonna be nobody's love  
Never gonna need nobody's trust but yours  
No no no  
If my love ain't your love then it's nobody's  
It's only yours only yours not just anybody's  
And if you ever leave then I'm never gon' want nobody  
Nobody's love  
If my love ain't your love then it's nobody's  
It's only yours only yours not just anybody's  
And if you ever leave then I'm never gon' want nobody  
Nobody's love
