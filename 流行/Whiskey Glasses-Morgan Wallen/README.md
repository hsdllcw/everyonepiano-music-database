### Whiskey Glasses歌词：

Pour me pour me another drink  
Cause I don't wanna feel a thing  
No more hell naw  
I just want to sip til the pain wears off  
Pour me pour me another round  
Line 'em up and knock 'em down  
Two more let's go  
Cause I ain't ever hurt like this before  
Don't wanna think about her  
Wear a ring without her  
Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar  
Can't sing without her  
So make them drinks strong  
Cause brother she's gone  
And if I'm ever gonna move on  
I'm gonna need some whiskey glasses  
Cause I don't wanna see the truth  
She's probably making out on the couch right now  
With someone new  
Yeah I'm need some whiskey glasses  
If I'm gonna make it through  
If I'm gonna be single  
I'm need a double shot of that heartbreak proof  
And see the world through whiskey glasses  
See the world through whiskey glasses  
Last call  
I swear this will be my last call  
I ain't drunk dialing no more at 3am  
Mr bartender hit me again  
Don't wanna think about her  
Wear a ring without her  
Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar  
Can't sing without her  
So make them drinks strong  
Cause brother she's gone  
And if I'm ever gonna move on  
I'm gonna need some whiskey glasses  
Cause I don't wanna see the truth  
She's probably making out on the couch right now  
With someone new  
Yeah I'm need some whiskey glasses  
If I'm gonna make it through  
If I'm gonna be single  
I'm need a double shot of that heartbreak proof  
And see the world through whiskey glasses  
See the world through whiskey glasses  
Line 'em up  
Line 'em up  
Line 'em up  
Line 'em up  
Knock 'em back  
Knock 'em back  
Knock 'em back  
Knock 'em back  
Fill 'em up  
Fill 'em up  
Fill 'em up  
Fill 'em up  
Cause if she ain't ever coming back  
Line 'em up  
Line 'em up  
Line 'em up  
Line 'em up  
Knock 'em back  
Knock 'em back  
Knock 'em back  
Knock 'em back  
Fill 'em up  
Fill 'em up  
Fill 'em up  
Fill 'em up  
Cause if she ain't ever coming back  
I'm gonna need some whiskey glasses  
Cause I don't wanna see the truth  
She's probably making out on the couch right now  
With someone new  
Yeah I'm need some whiskey glasses  
If I'm gonna make it through  
If I'm gonna be single  
I'm need a double shot of that heartbreak proof  
And see the world through whiskey glasses  
See the world through whiskey glasses  
See the world through whiskey glasses
