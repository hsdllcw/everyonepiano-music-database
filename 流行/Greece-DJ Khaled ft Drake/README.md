### Greece歌词：

Come with me leave all of your things yeah  
We can stop at Gucci stop at Louis V yeah  
Come with me fly you out to Greece  
Full speed survoler Paris yeah  
Come with me leave all of your things yeah  
We can stop at Gucci stop at Louis V yeah  
Come with me fly you out to Greece  
Full speed survoler Paris  
Speedboats baby in Nikki Beach  
Waves in my ears smokin' w**d  
Wait wait  
Whippin' through the sand in a Jeep  
Wait wait  
All because of what I did on beats baby  
Life's sweet baby iced out baby  
You just go get ready we go out baby  
Long time lookin' for the bounce yeah  
OZ had the bounce yeah  
Come with me leave all of your things yeah  
We can stop at Gucci stop at Louis V yeah  
Come with me fly you out to Greece  
Full speed survoler Paris  
Come with me leave all of your things yeah  
We can stop at Gucci stop at Louis V yeah  
Come with me fly you out to Greece  
Full speed je suis ton génie  
Rolls Royce baby in Hidden Hills  
Bags full of hunnid dollar bills  
Wait wait  
Joggin' past your wifey as she get chills  
Wait wait  
All because of how I kept it real  
Life's sweet baby on a G Wag  
I getcha anything you need baby yeah

Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo  
Doo-doo-doo-doo  
I just have to go in on that  
Never fallin' why you makin' problems  
I've been silent why you makin' problems  
I'm a problem bein' rich is not my fault  
You decide who you think the s**t reside with  
I been quiet hard to miss me when I'm flyin'  
Goin' out to Caicos she can stay in my room  
She can stay in my room and it ain't my  
I was tryna play it right  
I was tryna treat you nice  
Funny how I had to stop  
See me when I'm outside  
We ain't have a problem  
Then you went and found one  
How you gonna get a bag  
She can't help but get attached  
See me when I'm outside  
See me on the Southside  
I could tell you're sick inside  
'Cause she just wanna love me she don't wanna leave me  
She just wanna love me she don't wanna leave me
