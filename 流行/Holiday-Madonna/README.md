### Holiday歌词：

Holiday celebrate  
Holiday celebrate  
If we took a holiday  
Took some time to celebrate  
Just one day out of life  
it would be  
it would be so nice  
Everybody spread the word  
We're gonna have a celebration  
All across the worldIn every nationIt's time for the good times  
Forget about the bad times oh yeah  
One day to come together  
To release the pressure  
We need a holiday  
If we took a holiday  
Took some time to celebrate  
Just one day out of life  
It would be  
it would be so nice  
You can turn this world around  
And bring back all of those happydays  
Put your troubles downIt's time to celebrate  
Let love shine  
And we will find  
A way to come together  
And make things better  
We need a holiday  
If we took a holiday  
Took some time to celebrate  
Just one day out of life  
It would be  
it would be so nice  
Holiday celebrate  
Holiday celebrate  
If we took a holiday  
Took some time to celebrate  
Just one day out of life  
It would be  
it would be so nice  
Come together in every nation
