### He Is歌词：

We're standing here by the abyss and the world is in flames  
Two star crossed lovers reaching out to the beast with many names  
He is  
He's the shining and the light without whom I cannot see  
And he is  
Insurrection he is spite he's the force that made me be  
He is  
Nostro dis pater nostr' alma mater  
He is  
We're hiding here inside a dream and all our doubts are now destroyed  
The guidance of the morning stars will lead the way into the void  
He is  
He's the shining and the light without whom I cannot see  
And he is  
Insurrection he is spite he's the force that made me be  
He is  
Nostro dis pater nostr' alma mater  
He is  
He is  
He's the shining and the light without whom I cannot see  
And he is  
Insurrection he is spite he's the force that made me be  
He is  
He's the shining and the light without whom I cannot see  
And he is  
The disobedience that holds us together  
He is  
Nostro dis pater nostr' alma mater  
And we are falling over the precipice
