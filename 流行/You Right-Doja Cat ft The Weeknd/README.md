### You Right歌词：

Doja Cat：  
I got a man but I want you  
I got a man but I want you  
And it's just nerves it's just d**k  
Making me think 'bout someone new  
You know I got so much to say  
I try to hide it in my face  
And it don't work you see through  
That I just want to get with you  
And you right  
You right I got my guy  
But I I can't help it I want you  
Say you right I got my guy  
But I I can't help it I want you  
I can't stop and look the other way  
'Cause I know it could be babe and you never feel the same  
You be thinkin' 'bout it every day  
Don't believe in fairytales but we got our fantasies  
And it's me and you now see  
Tryna be all through your sheets  
Everywhere on top of me  
Actin' like it's not that deep  
Boy you can take it off of me  
Tell me what it's 'bout to be  
Really feel it's bound to bе  
I can't tell no one but they all know  
I got a man but I want you  
I got a man but I want you  
And it's just nеrves it's just d**k  
Making me think 'bout someone new  
You know I got so much to say  
I try to hide it in my face  
And it don't work you see through  
That I just want to get with you  
And you right  
You right I got my guy  
But I I can't help it I want you  
Say you right I got my guy  
But I I can't help it I want you  
The Weeknd：  
Girl I want you like you want me too  
I feel that energy  
Oh yeah  
When you're on top of me  
Oh yeah  
I know your man he ain't controllin' you  
But you still hesitate  
Oh  
'Cause you chose loyalty  
Oh yeah  
But I know your history  
Hey  
Met him before your peak  
Hey  
He's so connected to that woman that you used to be  
But-but-but the s*x will cloud your memory  
A couple strokes I'll put it in then you'll belong to me  
Doja Cat/The Weeknd：  
I got a man but I want you  
I got a man but I want you  
Yeah  
And it's just nerves it's just d**k  
Making me think 'bout someone new  
You know I got so much to say  
I try to hide it in my face  
And it don't work you see through  
That I just want to get with you  
Doja Cat：  
And you right  
Right  
You right I got my guy  
But I I can't help it I want you  
Say you right  
Got my guy  
But I  
Can't help it I want you
