### Two Ghosts歌词：

Same lips red same eyes blue  
Same white shirt couple more tattoos  
But it's not you and it's not me  
Tastes so sweet looks so real  
Sounds like something that I used to feel  
But I can't touch what I see  
We're not who we used to be  
We're not who we used to be  
We're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me  
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat  
The fridge light washes this room white  
Moon dances over your good side  
This was all we used to need  
Tongue-tied like we've never known  
Telling those stories we already told  
'Cause we don't say what we really mean  
We're not who we used to be  
We're not who we used to be  
We're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me  
We're not who we used to be  
We're not who we used to be  
We're just two ghosts swimming in a glass half empty  
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat  
We're not who we used to be  
We're not who we used to be  
We're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me  
We're not who we used to be  
We don't see what we used to see  
We're just two ghosts swimming in a glass half empty  
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat  
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat  
I'm just trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
