### Trainwreck歌词：

La dee da, yeah

You fled from medication 'cause it only causes pain  
You won't go to the doctor, he keeps calling you insane  
You're lost even when you're going the right way  
You mean the world to me even though you might be crazy

[Chorus:]  
And you said we wouldn't make it  
But look how far we've come  
For so long my heart was breaking  
But now we're standing strong  
The things you say make me fall harder each day  
You're a trainwreck  
But I wouldn't love you if you changed!  
No, yeah!

I shook your hand and you pulled it right away, yeah  
You asked me to dance instead. I said, "No way!"  
Inside I was dying to give it a try and you begged me, so I stayed  
I knew you were different from the way I caved

[Chorus:]  
And you said we wouldn't make it  
But look how far we've come  
For so long my heart was breaking  
But now we're standing strong  
The things you say, you make me fall harder each day  
You're a trainwreck  
But I wouldn't love you if you changed!  
Yeah, oh, no, yeah

We were so different  
But opposites attract  
So my hope kept growing  
And I never looked back  
You're one of a kind!  
No one can change this heart of mine  
Oh!

[Chorus:]  
You said we wouldn't make it  
But look how far we've come  
For so long my heart was breaking  
And now we're standing strong  
The things you say, you make me fall harder each day  
You're a trainwreck  
But I wouldn't love you if you changed!  
Oh, oh, yeah

...One more thing I thought I'd share with someone special  
I'm falling like I've never fell before  
It's funny you said we'd never make it and look how far we've come  
You're a trainwreck  
But with you I'm in love
