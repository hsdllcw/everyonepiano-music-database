### X歌词：

Nick Jonas/Joe Jonas：  
Yeah  
Ooh-la-la by the pool we're singing "Bailando"  
Two ni-nights with a view yeah  
Keeping those blinds closed  
Yeah  
She said "I wanna find somebody by nightfall"  
Ooh-na-na could it be ya  
Baby I like you  
Joe Jonas：  
Oh watching her move I was lost in the rhythms  
And she pulled me close by the look in her eyes  
Don't know her name but I know that I need her  
She said "Boy you won't be lonely tonight"  
Joe Jonas/Nick Jonas：  
She said "Ooh-ooh-ooh"  
Kiss me like your ex is in the room  
Don't you be afraid of something new  
If you play it right you can be that someone  
Yeah that someone who  
Won't leave me lonely tonight

Ooh-la-la make a move yeah baby by last call  
Full moon night with the lights off

Psycho  
Ooh-la-la if it's cool  
Yeah baby I'd like to
