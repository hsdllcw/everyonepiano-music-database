**Snow (Hey Oh)** 是Red Hot Chili
Peppers（呛辣红椒）在2006年第49届格莱美奖的获奖作品，来自于双专辑《Stadium
Arcadium》（星战竞技场）。该曲发布后迅速在Billboard的现代摇滚乐列表上获得首位，并在该位置连续保持了五星期。这首歌是他们第11首榜首曲目。

主唱安东尼•基德斯表示，这首歌“是关于生存和重新开始。我把一切都弄得一团糟，但我有雪白的一张画纸让我从新开始”。然而乐队在星战竞技场巡回演出结束5年之后才首次登台演出这首歌，已是2012年6月28日，当时他们在荷兰进行I'm
with You巡回演出。

### Snow (Hey Oh)歌词：

Come to decide that the things that I tried  
Were in my life just to get high on  
When I sit alone come get a little known  
But I need more than myself this time  
Step from the road to the sea to the sky  
And I do believe that we rely on  
When I lay it on come get to play it on  
All my life to sacrifice  
Hey oh  
Listen what I say oh  
I got your hey oh  
Now listen what I say oh oh oh oh  
When will I know that I really can't go  
To the well once more time to decide on  
When it's killing me when will I really see  
All that I need to look inside  
Come to believe that I better not leave  
Before I get my chance to ride  
When it's killing me what do I really need  
All that I need to look inside  
Hey oh  
Listen what I say oh  
Come back and hey oh  
Look at what I say oh oh oh oh  
The more I see the less I know  
The more I like to let it go  
Hey oh whoa whoa  
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder  
Where it's so white as snow  
Privately divided by a world so undecided  
And there's nowhere to go  
In between the cover of another perfect wonder  
And it's so white as snow  
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed  
And there's nowhere to go  
When to descend to amend for a friend  
All the channels that have broken down  
Now you bring it up I'm gonna ring it up  
Just to hear you sing it out  
Step from the road to the sea to the sky  
And I do believe what we rely on  
When I lay it on come get to play it on  
All my life to sacrifice  
Hey oh  
Listen what I say oh  
I got your hey oh  
Listen what I say oh  
The more I see the less I know  
The more I like to let it go  
Hey oh whoa whoa  
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder  
Where it's so white as snow  
Privately divided by a world so undecided  
And there's nowhere to go  
In between the cover of another perfect wonder  
And it's so white as snow  
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed  
And there's nowhere to go  
I said hey hey yeah  
Oh yeah tell my love now  
Hey hey yeah  
Oh yeah tell my love now  
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder  
Where it's so white as snow  
Privately divided by a world so undecided  
And there's nowhere to go  
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder  
Where it's so white as snow  
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed  
And there's nowhere to go  
I said hey oh yeah  
Oh yeah tell my love now  
Hey hey yeah oh yeah
