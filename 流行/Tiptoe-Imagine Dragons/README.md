Tiptoe歌词：

  
In the morning light  
Let my roots take flight  
Watch me fall above  
Like a vicious dove  
They don't see me come  
Who can blame then?  
They never seem to catch my eye  
But I've never wondered why  
.  
I won't fall asleep  
I won't fall asleep  
.  
Hey yeah  
Don't let 'em know we're coming  
Hey yeah  
Tip toe higher  
Take some time to  
Simmer down keep your head down low  
Hey yeah  
Tip toe higher  
.  
From your slanted view  
See the morning dew  
Sink into the soil  
Watch the water boil  
They won't see me run  
Who can blame them?  
They never look to see me fly  
So I never had to lie  
.  
I won't fall asleep  
I won't fall asleep  
.  
Hey yeah  
Don't let 'em know we're coming  
Hey yeah  
Tip toe higher  
Take some time to  
Simmer down keep your head down low  
Hey yeah  
Tip toe higher  
.  
Nobody else  
Nobody else  
Nobody else can take me higher  
Nobody else can take me higher  
Nobody else can take me higher  
Nobody else  
.  
Hey yeah  
Don't let 'em know we're coming  
Hey yeah  
Tip toe higher  
Take some time to  
Simmer down keep your head down low  
Hey yeah  
Tip toe higher  
.  
Hey yeah  
Don't let 'em know we're coming  
Hey yeah  
Tip toe higher  
Take some time to  
Simmer down keep your head down low  
Hey yeah  
Tip toe higher
