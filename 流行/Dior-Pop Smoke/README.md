### Dior歌词：

Traphouse Mob  
Huh roll another one  
Said I'm never lackin' always pistol packing  
With them automatics we gon' send him to heaven  
Wait wait wait wait ayy ayy woo Aw s**t huh  
Oh you feelin' sturdy huh You feelin' sturdy man  
Shake somethin'  
Shake it shake it shake it  
She like the way that I dance  
She like the way that I move  
She like the way that I rock  
She like the way that I woo  
And she let it clap for a n***a  
She let it clap for a n***a  
And she throw it back for a n***a  
Yeah she throw it back for a n***a  
Mike Amiri Mike Amiri  
Billie Jean Billie Jean uh  
Christian Dior Dior  
I'm up in all the stores  
When it rains it pours  
She like the way I rrr  
Mike Amiri Mike Amiri  
Billie Jean Billie Jean uh  
Christian Dior Dior  
I'm up in all the stores  
When it rains it pours  
She like the way I rrr  
When I walk in the spot thirty on me  
Buy out the club n***as know that I'm paid  
B***h I'm a thot get me lit  
I can't f**k with these n***as 'cause n***as is gay  
All on my page suckin' dick  
All in my comments and screamin' my name  
While I'm in the club throwin'  
Them hundreds and fifties and ones and ones  
Pop Smoke they know I'm wildin'  
If I'm on the island I'm snatchin' the cell  
Brody got locked denied his bail  
Until he free I'm raisin' hell  
Tell my shooters call me FaceTime  
For all the times we had to face time  
Free D-Nice he doin' state time  
If you need the glizzy you could take mine  
Please don't come out your mouth you know I'm like that  
I'll make a movie like TNT  
Glock-30 on me ask who really want it  
I bet I air it like BNB  
Nappy Blue wildin' in my section  
And I keep that 38 for the weapon  
Remember when I came home from corrections  
All the bad b***hes in my direction  
She like the way that I dance  
She like the way that I move  
She like the way that I rock  
She like the way that I woo  
And she let it clap for a n***a  
She let it clap for a n***a  
And she throw it back for a n***a  
Yeah she throw it back for a n***a  
Mike Amiri Mike Amiri  
Billie Jean Billie Jean uh  
Christian Dior Dior  
I'm up in all the stores  
When it rains it pours  
She like the way I rrr  
Mike Amiri Mike Amiri  
Billie Jean Billie Jean uh  
Christian Dior Dior  
I'm up in all the stores  
When it rains it pours  
She like the way I rrr  
Traphouse Mob Mob Mob
