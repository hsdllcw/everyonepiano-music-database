### Hold Me While You Wait歌词：

I'm waitin' up savin' all my precious time  
Losin' light I'm missin' my same old us  
Before we learned our truth too late  
Resigned to fate fadin' away  
So tell me can you turn around  
I need someone to tear me down  
Oh tell me can you turn around  
But either way  
Hold me while you wait  
I wish that I was good enough  
If only I could wake you up  
My love my love my love my love  
Won't you stay a while  
Tell me more tell me something I don't know  
Could we come close to havin' it all  
If you're gonna waste my time  
Let's waste it right  
And hold me while you wait  
I wish that I was good enough  
If only I could wake you up  
My love my love my love my love  
Won't you stay a while  
I wish you cared a little more  
I wish you'd told me this before  
My love my love my love my love  
Won't you stay a while  
This is you this is me this is all we need  
Is it true  
My faith is shaken but I still believe  
This is you this is me this is all we need  
So won't you stay a while  
And hold me while you wait  
I wish that I was good enough  
If only I could wake you up  
My love my love my love my love  
Won't you stay a while  
I wish you cared a little more  
I wish you'd told me this before  
My love my love my love my love  
Won't you stay a while  
Stay a while  
Stay a while  
My love my love my love  
Won't you stay a while
