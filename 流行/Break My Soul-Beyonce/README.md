《 **Break My Soul**
》由美国歌手Beyoncé演唱，于2022年6月20日发行。同时，此曲也是她第七张录音室专辑《Renaissance》的主打单曲。

《 _Break My Soul_ 》基于New Jack Swing风格，将R&B和Hip-
Hop完美融合的浩室舞曲，电力感十足！作为首单，Beyoncé这次选曲相当的接地气，场景一下子拉回到90年代盛行的欧陆街头舞曲年代，也符合专辑文艺回归的主题，相当抓耳洗脑。New
Jack
Swing流行于上世纪80年代末到上世纪90年代中期，和过去的R&B一样同样是将老元素与新元素进行融合，通常是运用嘻哈“黄金年代”当时非常流行的“swing”方式，也就是用鼓机和硬件采样器制作的街头感十足的音乐配上当代R&B艺人的演唱。

另外，这首舞曲也很适合当下。目前全世界的人都陷入疫情大环境下，各种各样的焦虑与不安随之而生，而歌词中呼喊这release your anger
released the stress不知不觉消解了所有不安和焦躁。即使无缘灯火闪烁的舞厅，你也可以戴上耳机享受独自一人的劲爆舞会！

The queen's in the front and the Dom's in the back  
Ain't taking no flicks but the whole clique snapped  
There's a whole lot of people in the house  
Tryin' to smoke with the yak in your mouth  
Good at night and we back outside  
You said you outside but you ain't that outside  
Worldwide hoodie with the mask outside  
In case you forgot how we act outside

Tryna fake it never makes it

You can have the stress and not take less  
I'll justify love  
We go round in circles round in circles  
Searching for love  
Round in circles  
We go up and down lost and found  
Searching for love  
Looking for something that lives inside me  
Looking for something that lives inside me
