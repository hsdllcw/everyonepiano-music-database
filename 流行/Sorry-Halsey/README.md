3月27日Halsey的最新采访，这张专辑就像Badlands一样，
是有明确故事背景和主题的一张专辑。它讲述了一对恋人，而他们之间貌合神离，踌躇不定的关系也与上一张专辑产生了联系。Halsey曾经对自己的声音感到不满，但是她在这一次专辑的录音过程中找回了自信，她发现自己的声音可以变得更加灵活，更加充满灵魂R&B的感觉。

### Sorry歌词：

I've missed your calls for months it seems  
Don't realize how mean I can be  
'Cause I can sometimes treat the people  
That I love like jewelry  
'Cause I can change my mind each day  
I didn't mean to try you on  
But I still know your birthday  
And your mother's favorite song  
So I'm sorry to my unknown lover  
Sorry that I can't believe that anybody ever really  
Starts to fall in love with me  
Sorry to my unknown lover  
Sorry I could be so blind  
Didn't mean to leave you  
And all of the things that we had behind  
Ooh  
Ooh  
Ooh  
I run away when things are good  
And never really understood  
The way you laid your eyes on me  
In ways that no one ever could  
And so it seems I broke your heart  
My ignorance has struck again  
I failed to see it from the start  
And tore you open 'til the end  
And I'm sorry to my unknown lover  
Sorry that I can't believe that anybody ever really  
Starts to fall in love with me  
Sorry to my unknown lover  
Sorry I could be so blind  
Didn't mean to leave you  
And all of the things that we had behind  
And someone will love you  
Someone will love you  
Someone will love you  
But someone isn't me  
Someone will love you  
Someone will love you  
Someone will love you  
But someone isn't me  
Sorry to my unknown lover  
Sorry that I can't believe that anybody ever really  
Starts to fall in love with me  
Sorry to my unknown lover  
Sorry I could be so blind  
Didn't mean to leave you  
And all of the things that we had behind  
And someone will love you  
Someone will love you  
Someone will love you  
But someone isn't me  
And someone will love you  
Someone will love you  
Someone will love you  
But someone isn't me
