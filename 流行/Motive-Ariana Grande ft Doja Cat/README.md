### Motive歌词：

Mu-Mu-Mu-Murda  
Ariana Grande：  
Tell me why I get this feeling  
That you really wanna turn me on  
Tell me why I get this feeling  
That you really wanna make me yours ah  
'Cause I see you tryin' subliminally tryin'  
To see if I'm gon' be the one to sing along  
I admit it's exciting parts of me kinda like it  
But before I lead you on  
Baby tell me what's your motive  
Motive  
What's your motive  
What's your motive  
Ah  
So tell me what's your motive  
Motive  
What's your motive  
What's your motive  
Ah  
I could call bulls**t all from a mile away  
Don't say  
You want me if you can't keep comin' back for me  
Might have to curve you if you just can't talk straight  
Just say  
Say what you mean 'cause you might get it  
'Cause I see you tryin' subliminally tryin'  
To see if I'm gon' be the one to sing along  
I admit it's exciting parts of me kinda like it  
But before I lead you on  
Ariana Grande/Doja Cat：  
Tell me what's your motive

Did you want a trophy or you wanna sport me baby  
Want me on your neck 'cause you wanted respect  
'Cause you fightin' some war baby  
Well I had to bring the fists out had to put a wall up

Tell me everything that's on your mind come on
