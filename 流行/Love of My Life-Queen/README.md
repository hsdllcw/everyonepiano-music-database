**Love of My Life双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Love of My Life_
是英国摇滚乐队Queen演唱的歌曲。乐队影响了二十世纪后期几乎所有的重金属乐队，它独特的歌剧式摇滚为后来的前卫金属指引了方向。他们华丽的舞台表演方式也常为后人所效仿。乐队尊贵与不朽的乐坛地位犹如他们超长待机的女王，几十年音乐生涯锻造的非凡荣誉与国际影响，已非更多奖项所能承载与描述。

### Love of My Life歌词：

Love of my life  
you've hurt me  
You've broken my heart and now you leave me  
Love of my life can't you see  
Bring it back bring it back  
Don't take it away from me because you don't know  
What it means to me  
Love of my life don't leave me  
You've taken my love all of my love and now desert me  
Love of my life can't you see  
Please bring it back bring it back  
Don't take it away from me  
Because you don't know  
What it means to me  
Who will remember  
When this is blown over  
And everything's all by the way - ooh yeah  
When I grow older  
I will be there at your side to remind you  
How I still love you - i still love you  
Ooh back - hurry back  
Please bring it back home to me  
Because you don't know what it means to me  
Love of my life  
Love of my life  
Ooh ooh
