### Dangerously歌词：

Oh  
This is gonna hurt  
But I blame myself first  
Cause I ignored the truth  
Drunk off that love my head up  
There's no forgetting you  
You've awoken me  
But you're choking me  
I was so obsessed  
Gave you all of me  
And now honestly  
I've got nothing left  
I loved you dangerously  
More than the air that I breathe  
Knew we would crash at the speed that we were going  
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me  
Baby I loved you dangerously  
Mmmm mmm  
I loved you dangerously woah  
Usually I hold the power  
With both my hands  
Tied behind my back  
Look at how things changed  
Cause now you're the train  
And I'm tied to the track  
You've awoken me  
But you're choking me  
I was so obsessed  
Gave you all of me  
And now honestly  
I've got nothing left  
Cause I loved you dangerously  
More than the air that I breathe  
Knew we would crash at the speed that we were going  
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me  
Baby I loved you dangerously  
You took me down down down down  
And kissed my lips with goodbye  
I see it now now now now  
It was a matter of time  
You know I know  
There's only one place this could lead  
But you are the fire I'm gasoline  
I love you  
I love you  
I love you  
I loved you dangerously  
Oh  
More than the air that I breathe  
Oh now I knew we would crash at the speed that we were going  
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me  
Oh oh baby I loved you dangerously  
Mmmm mmm  
Oh I loved you dangerously  
Oh oh I loved you dangerously
