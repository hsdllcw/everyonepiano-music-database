**Watermark** 是爱尔兰共和国著名独立音乐家Enya的歌曲。恩雅（爱尔兰盖尔语：Eithne Ní Bhraonáin ，英文：Enya
Brennan）自小修习古典钢琴，在充满音乐气息的环境中成长。她的音乐受到乐评人和世界听众的热情追捧，多次荣登新时代音乐排行榜的冠军，乃至被誉为“New
Age音乐之后”。

  
该曲收录在其同名专辑中。「水」是这张专辑中重要的意象，由同名单曲 " _watermark_
"引出专辑主题。在宁静有致的钢琴声中，一波波人声袭来，彷佛平静的水面，泛起一波波涟漪，袭袭的微风，吹拂过一望无际的水面。这是生命的起源，是思念的所在，也是一切忧伤的洗涤处。在另一首演奏曲"river"潺潺的逝水中，一切哀愁消失殆尽，只觉眼前清朗开阔。

### Watermark歌词：

Watermark (With Translation)  
Cursum Perficio  
Cursum perficio. I am making an end to my course.  
Verbum sapienti: A word to the wise:  
quo plus habent, the more [people] have  
eo plus cupiunt. the more they want.  
Post nubila, Phoebus After the clouds, Phoebus (1)  
Iternum Over and over again (2)  
Phoebus was one of the names for the Sun god,  
which may be more famous as Apollo (Greek).  
It is notable that the Sun is a male.  
The word 'iternum' does not exist;  
it could either be a misspelling for 'eternum' (eternal),  
which is unlikely since it is very rare that an adjective  
be used as an adverb, or for 'iterum' (again and again)  
which is in fact an adverb and makes a little more sense (!!).  
The meaning of 'cursum perficio' is actually best explained  
by the footnote to the lyrics:  
Enya was inspired by these words she saw on Marylin Monroe's  
last house, where they were taken to mean "my journey ends here".  
It is a rather "free" translation, but it's probably a very good  
way to convey the meaning of Latin, which has a way of saying  
things that is very distant from modern-day English.  
The fact that those words turned out to be prophetical only  
adds to the power of the song.
