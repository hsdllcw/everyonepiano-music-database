### Just Like Fire歌词：

I know that I'm running out of time  
I want it all, mmm, mmm  
And I'm wishing they'd stop tryna turn me off  
I want it on, mmm, mmm

And I'm walking on a wire, trying to go higher  
Feels like I'm surrounded by clowns and liars  
Even when I give it all away  
I want it all, mmm, mmm

We came here to run it, run it, run it  
We came here to run it, run it, run it

Just like fire, burning up the way  
If I can light the world up for just one day  
Watch this madness, colorful charade  
No one can be just like me any way  
Just like magic, I'll be flying free  
I'mma disappear when they come for me  
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?  
No one can be just like me any way

Just like fire, uh

And people like to laugh at you 'cause they are all the same, mmm, mmm  
See I would rather we just go a different way than play the game mm, mm

And no matter the weather, we can do it better  
You and me together, forever and ever  
We don't have to worry 'bout a thing, 'bout a thing

We came here to run it, run it, run it  
We came here to run it, run it, run it

Just like fire, burning up the way  
If I can light the world up for just one day  
Watch this madness, colorful charade  
No one can be just like me any way  
Just like magic, I'll be flying free  
I'mma disappear when they come for me  
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?  
No one can be just like me any way

Just like fire, fire, fire  
Run it, run it, run it  
We came here to run it, run it, run it

So look I came here to run it  
Just 'cause nobody's done it  
Y'all don't think I can run it  
But look, I've been here, I've done it  
Impossible? Please  
Watch I do it with ease  
You just gotta believe  
Come on, come on with me

Oh, what's a girl to do?  
(What, what?)  
Hey, what's a girl to do?  
(What, what?)  
Oh, what's a girl to do?  
(What, what?)  
Oh, what's a girl to do?

Just like fire, burning up the way  
If I can light the world up for just one day  
Watch this madness, colorful charade  
No one can be just like me any way

Just like fire, burning up the way  
If I can light the world up for just one day  
Watch this madness, colorful charade  
No one can be just like me any way  
Just like magic, I'll be flying free  
I'mma disappear when they come for me  
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?  
No one can be just like me any way  
Just like fire, fire

Run it, run it, run it  
Just like fire  
Run it, run it, run it
