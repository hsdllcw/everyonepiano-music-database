### Chew On My Heart歌词：

Take your time  
I'll be right here  
I know no one could ever love me better  
Take all night  
You're the truth that is breaking me  
And keeping me together together  
I wanna be your touch  
Sleeping's so tough  
You're burning up my mind  
What would it feel like if you tore me apart  
Come on chew on my heart  
Come on chew on my heart  
I wanna be your touch  
Sleeping's so tough  
You're burning up my mind  
What would it feel like if you tore me apart  
Come on chew on my heart  
Come on chew on my heart  
I'm a fire I'm a hot mess  
I'm thinking things that I might start regretting  
So hear me out I need you now  
I'm spiralling I'm sinking down  
Wait for me I'm sending up a message  
A message  
I wanna be your touch  
Sleeping's so tough  
You're burning up my mind  
What would it feel like if you tore me apart  
Come on chew on my heart  
Come on chew on my heart  
I wanna be your touch  
Sleeping's so tough  
You're burning up my mind  
What would it feel like if you tore me apart  
Come on chew on my heart  
Come on chew on my heart  
Ooh ooh  
Tear me apart  
Ooh ooh  
Tear me apart  
I wanna be your touch  
Sleeping's so tough  
It's burning up my mind  
What would it feel like if you tore me apart  
Come on chew on my heart  
Come on chew on my heart  
I wanna be your touch  
Sleeping's so tough  
You're burning up my mind  
What would it feel like if you tore me apart  
Come on chew on my heart  
Come on chew on my heart  
Ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh
