Something New_ 是一支被称作SpiceGirls接班人的英国流行女子团体Girls Aloud的歌曲。Girls
Aloud是继SpiceGirls之后成绩最为耀眼的英国新生代女子团体。虽然走流行路线，又是以偶像选拔节目起家，但是，精采融合各样流行元素把玩一块，在强烈动感的节奏铺陈下，透出阵阵令人耳目一新的呛声节拍！同年底的爱情文艺大片"Love
Actually/爱是您爱是我"，片 中深受乐迷喜爱翻唱Pointer
Sister在1983年登上全美亚军的经典之作"Jump"，就是交由呛女生合唱团重新热闹诠释，相隔20年后仍争气的空降全英金榜亚军！

All I want is something new, something I can hold on to  
I don't wanna talk, I just wanna dance  
Baby let it drop, catch me if you can  
Down with the rhythm of another beat  
Gotta take that back, what you said to me  
Never giving in when the sun's so high  
Gotta feel that heat, when you call's so fine  
Down with a rhythm of another street  
Gotta let this go, cause I feel so free  
Never giving in cause I need you here  
Go girls, go go go  
We girls gonna take control  
You boys better know know know  
We girls gonna run this show  
Go girls, go go go  
We girls gonna take control  
You boys better know know know  
We girls gonna run this run this  
All I want is something new, something I can hold on to

Baby let it drop, catch me if you can  
Cause we're the leaders of the pack  
Take a walk on the wild side of life, of life  
Take a walk on the wild side of life, of life  
Bring it back to the other side  
Can you feel the beat deep underground  
Boy tonight it's getting loud  
We can go, go anywhere  
We don't care, let me take it higher  
We can do, do anything  
Play the game  
And maybe you'll win  
Boy tonight you can't hold me back  
Ido what I want, yeah I like it like that  
All I want is something new, something I can hold on to  
I don't wanna talk, I just wanna dance  
Baby let it drop, catch me if you can  
All I want is something new, something I can hold on to  
I don't wanna talk, I just wanna dance  
Baby let it drop, catch me if you can
