### Prisoner歌词：

Prisoner prisoner  
Locked up can't get you off my mind  
Off my mind  
Lord knows I tried a million times  
Million times  
Oh whoa  
Why can't you why can't you  
Just let me go  
Strung out on a feeling  
My hands are tied  
Your face on my ceiling  
I fantasize  
Oh I can't control it I can't control it  
I can't control it  
I try to replace it  
With city lights  
I'll never escape it  
I need the high  
Oh I can't control it I can't control it  
You keep making it harder to stay  
But I still can't run away  
I gotta know why can't you  
Why can't you  
Just let me go  
Prisoner prisoner  
Locked up can't get you off my mind  
Off my mind  
Lord knows I tried a million times  
Million times  
Oh whoa  
Why can't you why can't you  
Just let me go  
Prisoner prisoner  
Locked up can't get you off my mind  
Off my mind  
Lord knows I tried a million times  
Million times  
Oh whoa  
Why can't you why can't you  
Just let me go  
I tasted heaven now I can't live without it  
I can't forget you and your love is the loudest  
Oh I can't control it I can't control it  
You keep making it harder to stay  
Oh whoa  
But I still can't run away  
I gotta know why can't you  
Why can't you  
Just let me go  
Prisoner prisoner  
Locked up can't get you off my mind  
Off my mind  
Lord knows I tried a million times  
Million times  
Oh whoa  
Why can't you why can't you  
Just let me go  
Prisoner prisoner  
Locked up can't get you off my mind  
Off my mind  
Lord knows I tried a million times  
Million times  
Oh whoa  
Why can't you why can't you  
Just let me go  
Prisoner  
Can't get you off my mind  
Why can't you just let me go  
Million times  
I wanna know why can't you  
Why can't you  
I wanna know why can't you  
Why can't you  
I gotta know why can't you  
Why can't you  
Just let me go
