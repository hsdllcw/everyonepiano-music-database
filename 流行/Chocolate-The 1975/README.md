### Chocolate歌词：

Hey now call it a spliff 'cause you know that you will

Oh you bite your friend like chocolate

You say, we'll go where nobody knows,  
with guns hidden under our petticoats  
No we're never gunna' quit it,  
no we're never gunna' quit it no

Now we run run away from the boys in the blue,

and my car smells like chocolate

Hey now think about what you do,  
think about what they say,  
think about how to think  
Pause it play it, pause it play it, itpause

Oh we go where nobody knows,  
with guns hidden under our petticoats  
No we're never gunna' quit it,
