### Tik Tok歌词：

Wake up in the morning feeling like P Diddy  
Put my glasses on, I'm out the door  
I'm gonna hit this city (Let's go)  
Before I leave,  
Brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack  
Cause when I leave for the night,  
I ain't coming back  
I'm talking - pedicure on our toes, toes  
Trying on all our clothes, clothes  
Boys blowing up our phones, phones  
Drop-toping, playing our favorite CDs  
Pulling up to the parties  
Trying to get a little bit tipsy  
Don't stop, make it pop  
DJ, blow my speakers up  
Tonight, Imma fight  
Till we see the sunlight  
Tick tock, on the clock  
But the party don't stop  
Woah-oh oh oh  
Woah-oh oh oh  
Don't stop, make it pop  
DJ, blow my speakers up  
Tonight, Imma fight  
Till we see the sunlight  
Tick tock, on the clock  
But the party don't stop  
Woah-oh oh oh  
Woah-oh oh oh  
Ain't got a care in world,  
But got plenty of beer  
Ain't got no money in my pocket,  
But I'm already here  
And now, the dudes are lining up  
Cause they hear we got swagger  
But we kick 'em to the curb  
unless they look like Mick Jagger  
I'm talking about  
everybody getting crunk, crunk  
Boys trying to touch my junk, junk  
Gonna smack him if he getting too drunk, drunk  
Now, now - we goin' til they kick us out, out  
Or the police shut us down, down  
Police shut us down, down  
Po-po shut us -  
Don't stop, make it pop  
DJ, blow my speakers up  
Tonight, Imma fight  
Till we see the sunlight  
Tick tock, on the clock  
But the party don't stop  
Woah-oh oh oh  
Woah-oh oh oh  
Don't stop, make it pop  
DJ, blow my speakers up  
Tonight, Imma fight  
Till we see the sunlight  
Tick tock, on the clock  
But the party don't stop  
Woah-oh oh oh  
Woah-oh oh oh  
DJ, you build me up  
You break me down  
My heart, it pounds yeah, you got me  
With my hands up  
You got me now  
You gotta that sound yeah, you got me  
DJ, you build me up  
You break me down  
My heart, it pounds yeah, you got me  
With my hands up  
Put your hands up  
Put your hands up  
No, the party don't stop until I walk in  
Don't stop, make it pop  
DJ, blow my speakers up  
Tonight, Imma fight  
Till we see the sunlight  
Tick tock, on the clock  
But the party don't stop  
Woah-oh oh oh  
Woah-oh oh oh  
Don't stop, make it pop  
DJ, blow my speakers up  
Tonight, Imma fight  
Till we see the sunlight  
Tick tock, on the clock  
But the party don't stop  
Woah-oh oh oh  
Woah-oh oh oh
