### Queen of Broken Hearts歌词：

I'm the queen of broken hearts  
Break you in a thousand parts  
Used to be a shooting star  
When did I become so dark  
Yeah you need to chill girl don't play me  
I'm too far gone you can't save me  
And I don't care f**king hate me  
I popped a pill and I'm faded  
Take anything make it about me  
It's a heavy crown it might drown me  
I know it sucks being around me  
So does life don't @ me don't doubt me  
I'm the queen of broken hearts  
Break you in a thousand parts  
Used to be a shooting star  
When did I become so dark  
I'm the queen of broken hearts  
Break you in a thousand parts  
Used to be a shooting star  
When did I become so dark  
I'm the queen of broken hearts  
Left you with a thousand scars  
Used to be a shooting star  
When did I become so dark  
Blocked my post and my story  
I'm sorry I can be annoying  
I go ghost without warning  
Popped a pill now I'm snoring  
Material girl you can't afford me  
This conversation got boring  
You're so two thousand before me  
You're in the past  
You're yesterday morning  
I'm the queen of broken hearts  
Break you in a thousand parts  
Used to be a shooting star  
When did I become so dark  
I'm the queen of broken hearts  
Break you in a thousand parts  
Used to be a shooting star  
When did I become so dark  
I'm the queen of broken hearts  
Left you with a thousand scars  
Used to be a shooting star  
When did I become so dark  
Tell me tell me I'm the worst  
Make you cry and make you hurt  
I'm the queen bow down to me  
I will leave you out to bleed  
Tell me tell me I'm the worst  
Make you cry and make you hurt  
I'm the queen bow down to me  
I will leave you out to bleed  
I'm the queen of broken hearts  
Yeah  
Break you in a thousand parts  
A thousand parts  
Used to be a shooting star  
When did I become so dark  
I'm the queen of broken hearts  
Of broken hearts  
Left you with a thousand scars  
Used to be a shooting star  
When did I become so dark  
When did I when did I become so dark  
When did I when did I become so dark  
When did I when did I become so dark  
Used to be a shooting star  
When did I become so dark
