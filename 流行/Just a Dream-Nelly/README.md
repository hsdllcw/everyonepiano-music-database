Just a Dream_
是震撼全美乐界的饶舌嘻哈新霸主Nelly的歌曲。这是一首讲诉想念妻子以及主角和妻子之间的感情的歌，MV是以黑白方式传送的，但同时却也不缺风韵与感情。在梦里主角看到了他与妻子的相遇，看到了妻子那久违的脸颊。

  
2000年夏天，嘻哈热浪吹向圣路易斯，一个名叫Nelly的嘻哈玩家把美国南方俚语与家乡味跟美国中西部摇摆乐搅和一下，靠着饶舌榜冠军曲"Country
Grammar(Hot S**t)"打出名堂，首张专辑“Country
Grammar/家有家规”勇夺全美流行与节奏蓝调榜双冠王，并连霸流行专辑榜7周冠军王座，辑中的"Ride Wit
Me"、"E.I."等单曲更炒热专辑销售红盘，光是美国就卖出900万张，因为Nelly的走红，嘻哈热力多了点骚劲，还有更多的趣味与霸气。
