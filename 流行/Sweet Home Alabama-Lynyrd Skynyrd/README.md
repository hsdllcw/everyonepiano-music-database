**Sweet Home Alabama** 是来自美国佛罗里达州的捷克森维尔郡Lynyrd Skynyrd乐队1971年为座落在阿拉巴马的录音棚写的。

  
阿拉巴马州当时被许多别的地方的美国人看不起，认为那里都是些没教养的乡下人。这首歌为阿拉巴马正名，并且讽刺那些自以为了不起的人。歌的第二段写到了Neil
Young，因为Young曾写过一首鄙视南方人的歌“Southern Man”，说南方种族主义盛行，而且非常守旧。

_  
Sweet Home Alabama_ 此歌刚开始时的“Turn it up”是乐队主唱Ronnie Van
Zant录音前随口让录音师把音量调高一些，并没什么涵义，最后混音时大家觉得留着的话效果也不错，就留了下来。而歌词中提到的“the
Swampers”是一群活跃在阿拉巴马录音棚里的音乐家，专门为独唱歌手配合声。

### Sweet Home Alabama歌词：

Big wheels keep on turning  
Carry me home to see my kin  
Singing songs about the Southland  
I miss Alabamy once again  
And I think its a sin, yes

Well I heard mister Young sing about her  
Well, I heard ole Neil put her down  
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember  
A Southern man don't need him around anyhow

Sweet home Alabama  
Where the skies are so blue  
Sweet Home Alabama  
Lord, I'm coming home to you

In Birmingham they love the gov' nor (boo, boo, boo)  
Now we all did what we could do  
Now Watergate does not bother me  
Does your conscience bother you?  
Tell the truth

Sweet home Alabama  
Where the skies are so blue  
Sweet Home Alabama  
Lord, I'm coming home to you  
Here I come Alabama

Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers  
And they've been known to pick a song or two  
Lord they get me off so much  
They pick me up when I'm feeling blue  
Now how about you?

Sweet home Alabama  
Where the skies are so blue  
Sweet Home Alabama  
Lord, I'm coming home to you

Sweet home Alabama  
Oh sweet home baby  
Where the skies are so blue  
And the guv'nor's true  
Sweet Home Alabama  
Lordy  
Lord, I'm coming home to you  
Yea, yea Montgomery's got the answer
