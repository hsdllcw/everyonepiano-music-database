### All Of Me歌词：

What would I do without your smart mouth  
Drawing me in and you kicking me out  
Got my head spinning no kidding I can't pin you down  
What's going on in that beautiful mind  
I'm on your magical mystery ride  
And I'm so dizzy don't know what hit me but I'll be alright  
My head's under water  
But I'm breathing fine  
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind  
'Cause all of me  
Loves all of you  
Love your curves and all your edges  
All your perfect imperfections  
Give your all to me  
I'll give my all to you  
You're my end and my beginning  
Even when I lose I'm winning  
'Cause I give you all all of me  
And you give me all all of you oh  
How many times do I have to tell you  
Even when you're crying you're beautiful too  
The world is beating you down I'm around through every mood  
You're my downfall you're my muse  
My worst distraction my rhythm and blues  
I can't stop singing it's ringing in my head for you  
My head's under water  
But I'm breathing fine  
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind  
'Cause all of me  
Loves all of you  
Love your curves and all your edges  
All your perfect imperfections  
Give your all to me  
I'll give my all to you  
You're my end and my beginning  
Even when I lose I'm winning  
'Cause I give you all all of me  
And you give me all all of you oh  
Give me all of you  
Cards on the table we're both showing hearts  
Risking it all though it's hard  
'Cause all of me  
Loves all of you  
Love your curves and all your edges  
All your perfect imperfections  
Give your all to me  
I'll give my all to you  
You're my end and my beginning  
Even when I lose I'm winning  
'Cause I give you all all of me  
And you give me all all of you  
I give you all all of me  
And you give me all all of you oh
