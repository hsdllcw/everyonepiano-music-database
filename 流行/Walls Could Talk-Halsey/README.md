### Walls Could Talk歌词：

Been about three days and I'm comin' back  
I'm about four minutes from a heart attack  
And I think you make me a maniac  
But you don't know  
Two years and we in between  
But we both been seventeen  
Here we go fist fight in a limousine  
But they don't know  
And we both hope there's something  
But we both both keep fronting  
And it's a closed discussion  
And I'm thinking damn  
If these walls could talk  
Oh baby like  
Shit is crazy right  
I ain't your baby no more  
Been about two weeks since you went away  
I'm about halfway through a  
And I go I'm wastin' a saturday  
Sittin' at home  
Someone who may not let you in  
But she's so damn good with a bobby pin  
Now you gon' play me like a violin  
Hittin' these notes  
And we both hope there's something  
But we both both keep fronting  
And it's a closed discussion  
And I'm thinking damn  
If these walls could talk  
Oh baby like  
Shit is crazy right  
I ain't your baby no more  
Oh hey  
Oh no more oh  
I ain't your baby no more
