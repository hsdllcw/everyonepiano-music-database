### Season Of Love歌词：

When the air turns cold  
And the fire play stars to glow  
It must be Christmas  
It must be Christmas  
As we could let sound the trees and  
Kissing on the mistold  
The loving gives us ooh it must be Christmas  
I hear the care we little thing  
Why we dear turn the falling snow  
Falling snow  
And so much show in the air  
It's impossible not to know  
This is the season  
The season of love love love  
It's doll me believe it  
This feeling is enough enough  
Whoa ooh ooh  
Don't late  
Please go away  
It can be like Christmas everyday  
Your body like me hear you say  
Whoa ooh ooh  
Oh don't light please  
Feeling the answer  
Christmas goes around again  
Everyday will leave in end  
This is the season of looove  
This is the season of looove  
On wrapping presents  
With we both build the snow man in the yard  
It must be Christmas  
It must be Christmas  
Us baby with your hand and hand  
And see of shinning star  
The loving gives us  
Ooh it must be Christmas  
Kiss God turn me better  
Just now rain dear start to fly  
Fly you cross the sky  
So much joy in the air  
It's impossible to the night  
This is the season  
The season of love love love  
It's doll me believe it  
This feeling is enough enough  
Whoa ooh ooh
