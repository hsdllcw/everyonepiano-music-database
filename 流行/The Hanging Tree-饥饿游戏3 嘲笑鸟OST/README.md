### The Hanging Tree歌词：

[00:00.90]Are you, are you  
[00:03.90]Coming to the tree  
[00:06.26]They strung up a man  
[00:09.07]They say who murdered three.  
[00:11.88]Strange things did happen here  
[00:14.59]No stranger would it be  
[00:16.96]If we met at midnight  
[00:20.18]In the hanging tree.  
[00:22.74]Are you, are you  
[00:25.66]Coming to the tree  
[00:28.12]Where dead man called out  
[00:31.49]For his love to flee.  
[00:33.80]Strange things did happen here  
[00:36.32]No stranger would it be  
[00:38.83]If we met at midnight  
[00:42.20]In the hanging tree.  
[00:44.61]Are you, are you  
[00:48.03]Coming to the tree  
[00:50.09]Where I told you to run,  
[00:52.80]So we'd both be free.  
[00:55.72]Strange things did happen here  
[00:58.58]No stranger would it be  
[01:00.89]If we met at midnight  
[01:03.97]In the hanging tree.  
[01:06.38]Are you, are you  
[01:09.04]Coming to the tree  
[01:11.20]Wear a necklace of hope,  
[01:13.99]Side by side with me.  
[01:16.10]Strange things did happen here  
[01:18.46]No stranger would it be  
[01:20.63]If we met at midnight  
[01:23.39]In the hanging tree.  
[01:25.99]Are you, are you  
[01:28.26]Coming to the tree  
[01:30.42]Where I told you to run,  
[01:32.78]So we'd both be free.  
[01:35.12]Strange things did happen here  
[01:37.66]No stranger would it be  
[01:40.02]If we met at midnight  
[01:42.68]In the hanging tree.  
[01:44.74]Are you, are you  
[01:47.26]Coming to the tree  
[01:49.52]They strung up a man  
[01:51.83]They say who murdered three.  
[01:54.45]Strange things did happen here  
[01:56.56]No stranger would it be  
[01:58.97]If we met at midnight  
[02:01.69]In the hanging tree.  
[02:03.90]Are you, are you  
[02:06.21]Coming to the tree  
[02:08.47]Where dead man called out  
[02:11.49]For his love to flee.  
[02:13.60]Strange things did happen here  
[02:15.77]No stranger would it be  
[02:18.13]If we met at midnight  
[02:20.79]In the hanging tree.
