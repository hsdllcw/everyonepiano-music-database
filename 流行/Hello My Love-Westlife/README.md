### Hello My Love歌词：

No one knows 'bout the things that I've been through with you  
There were times I'd drive you nearly mental  
But when you're mad you're still beautiful  
And I know that I'm punching way above  
So lucky that we fell in love  
Sometimes I wonder am I enough  
'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper  
Perfect teeth hair growing where it's meant to  
You know my lips are all I can hold against you  
This is all that I'll ever need you and I  
Hello my love  
I've been searching for someone like you  
For most my life  
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to  
You could have fallen hard for anyone  
Plenty of fish in the sea hey now  
For all of time now I know  
It's just my angel and me  
No one knows 'bout all the good things you do  
When people take advantage of you  
Your heart is pure and so beautiful  
And I know that it's just the way you are  
Father's eyes but mother's daughter  
And you tell me that you don't give enough  
And now I found someone with all the boxes that I want ticked  
'Cause your love is all I ever wanted  
Set my heart on fire I needed something  
This is all I wanted to be you and I  
Hello my love  
I've been searching for someone like you  
For most my life  
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to  
You could have fallen hard for anyone  
Plenty of fish in the sea hey now  
For all of time now I know  
It's just my angel and me  
'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper  
Perfect teeth hair growing where it's meant to  
You know my lips are all I can hold against you  
This is all that I'll ever need you and I  
You and I  
Hello my love  
I've been searching for someone like you  
For most my life  
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to  
You could have fallen hard for anyone  
Anyone  
Plenty of fish in the sea hey now  
For all of time now I know  
It's just my angel and me
