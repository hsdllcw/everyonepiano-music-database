### Your New Boyfriend歌词：

Life isn't quite what I thought I'd be  
When I was a kid on VoIP  
I thought when I get older I'd marry her  
I told her  
Now I'm 26 and I work in an office  
9 'til 5's not the best I'll be honest  
If I could change a single thing  
I'd make it me and not him  
But he's in your bed  
I'm in your Twitch chat  
I've got the key  
And he's just a doormat  
And even though he's got social skills  
That doesn't mean I can't pay the bills  
Anyway make the most of him  
'Cause she moves on pretty bloody quick  
Oh-oh your new boyfriend's an arsehole  
Woo  
And yeah I've met Jared  
Of course I've met Jared  
The one who took you away from me  
You hit it off instantly  
I know 'cause you won't stop telling me  
I've seen his jawline shoulders and muscles  
Push against his fashion sense  
I've thought about what he looks like nude  
I'm not gay though  
'Cause she's living the dream  
Living the dream living the dream  
Oh she's living the dream  
From back when we were 17  
She's living the dream  
Living the dream living the dream  
Oh she's living the dream  
From back when we were 17  
How on Earth could I be saved  
When I'm one click away from insane  
I just think that I deserve  
A little bit of what I earned  
I'm not gonna make another scene  
The one I made when I was 23  
Means I'm not allowed in Disney World  
But he's in your bed  
And I'm in your Twitch chat  
I've got the key  
And he's just a doormat  
'Cause even though he's got social skills  
That doesn't mean I can't pay the bills  
Anyway make the most of him  
'Cause she moves on pretty bloody quick  
Oh-oh your new boyfriend's an arsehole  
I think about you every day  
Every day  
So how on Earth can I be saved  
Can I be saved  
I think about him a lot as well  
I think about him  
Maybe if he wasn't fine as hell  
He's really fine as hell  
'Cause you're beauty  
And you're grace  
You're grace  
Your telephone calls are my favourite place  
And I want you to notice me  
With no restraining order please  
Jason Derulo  
I want you to care  
I want to smell your hair
