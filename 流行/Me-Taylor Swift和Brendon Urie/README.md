### Me!歌词：

I promise that you'll never find another like me  
I know that I'm a handful baby uh  
I know I never think before I jump  
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want  
And there's a lot of cool chicks out there  
I know that I went psycho on the phone  
I never leave well enough alone  
And trouble's gonna follow where I go  
And there's a lot of cool chicks out there  
But one of these things is not like the others  
Like a rainbow with all of the colors  
Baby doll when it comes to a lover  
I promise that you'll never find another like  
Me ooh  
I'm the only one of me  
Baby that's the fun of me  
Me ooh  
You're the only one of you  
Baby that's the fun of you  
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me  
I know I tend to make it about me  
I know you never get just what you see  
But I will never bore you baby  
And there's a lot of lame guys out there  
And when we had that fight out in the rain  
You ran after me and called my name  
I never want to see you walk away  
And there's a lot of lame guys out there  
'Cause one of these things is not like the others  
Living in winter I am your summer  
Baby doll when it comes to a lover  
I promise that you'll never find another like  
Me ooh  
I'm the only one of me  
Let me keep you company  
Me ooh  
You're the only one of you  
Baby that's the fun of you  
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me  
Hey kids  
Spelling is fun  
Girl there ain't no 'I' in team  
But you know there is a 'Me'  
Strike the band up 1 2 3  
I promise that you'll never find another like me  
Girl there ain't no 'I' in team  
But you know there is a 'Me'  
And you can't spell awesome without me  
I promise that you'll never find another like  
Me ooh  
And I want ya baby  
I'm the only one of me  
I'm the only one of me  
Baby that's the fun of me  
Baby that's the fun of me  
Me ooh  
You're the only one of you  
Baby that's the fun of you  
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like  
Me  
Girl there ain't no 'I' in team  
Ooh  
But you know there is a 'Me'  
I'm the only one of me  
Baby that's the fun of me  
Me  
Strike the band up 1 2 3  
Ooh  
You can't spell awesome without me  
You're the only one of you  
Baby that's the fun of you  
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me
