### Willow歌词：

I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night  
Rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife  
And if it was an open/shut case  
I never would've known from that look on your face  
Lost in your current like a priceless wine  
The more that you say the less I know  
Wherever you stray I follow  
I'm begging for you to take my hand  
Wreck my plans that's my man  
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind  
Head on the pillow I could feel you sneaking in  
As if you were a mythical thing  
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring  
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win  
The more that you say the less I know  
Wherever you stray I follow  
I'm begging for you to take my hand  
Wreck my plans that's my man  
You know that my train could take you home  
Anywhere else is hollow  
I'm begging for you to take my hand  
Wreck my plans that's my man  
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind  
They count me out time and time again  
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind  
But I come back stronger than a 90's trend  
Wait for the signal and I'll meet you after dark  
Show me the places where the others gave you scars  
Now this is an open/shut case  
I guess I should've known from the look on your face  
Every bait and switch was a work of art  
The more that you say the less I know  
Wherever you stray I follow  
I'm begging for you to take my hand  
Wreck my plans that's my man  
You know that my train could take you home  
Anywhere else is hollow  
I'm begging for you to take my hand  
Wreck my plans that's my man  
The more that you say the less I know  
Wherever you stray I follow  
I'm begging for you to take my hand  
Wreck my plans that's my man  
You know that my train could take you home  
Anywhere else is hollow  
I'm begging for you to take my hand  
Wreck my plans that's my man  
Hey that's my man  
That's my man  
Yeah that's my man  
Every bait and switch was a work of art  
That's my man  
Hey that's my man  
I'm begging for you to take my hand  
Wreck my plans that's my man
