### Grrrls歌词：

Fake faces hiding everywhere  
Made up makeup made up stares  
To hide their stolen air  
Don't look too close don't you dare  
Stupid seems to be in the air in the air everywhere  
Blameless I'll shatter through the glare  
Make it take it they won't share  
I can't fake it I'll just make it on my own  
I can't blame them I'll just maim them on my throne  
I can't fake it I'll just make it on my own  
I can't blame them I've just got to get to my throne  
I am the latest colors I sing the newest songs  
I read all the lyrics so I can sing along  
I am the latest colors I stand above my throne  
Waiting for an invite to never come along  
I am the latest colors I sing the newest songs  
I read all the lyrics so I can sing along  
I am the latest colors I hate the newest songs  
I can't stand the lyrics I'd never sing along  
I'll never sing along  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la  
I'll never sing along  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la  
I'll never sing along  
Trade places staggered truth or dare  
Only ask it if you care  
Trace back to all the millionaires  
Snake oil traders no one shares  
Soulless and stealing what they dare  
Hold your deck to your chest  
Faceless nobody is your friend  
Make it take it they won't share  
I can't fake it I'll just make it on my own  
I can't blame them I'll just maim them on my throne  
I can't fake it I'll just make it on my own  
I can't blame them I've just got to get to my throne  
I am the latest colors I sing the newest songs  
I read all the lyrics so I can sing along  
I am the latest colors I hate the newest songs  
I can't stand the lyrics I'd never sing along  
I'll never sing along  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la  
I'll never sing along  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la  
I'll never sing along  
I'll never sing along I'll never sing along  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la on my own  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la on my throne  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la on my own  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la get to my throne  
I am the latest colors I sing the newest songs  
I read all the lyrics so I can sing along  
I am the latest colors I stand above my throne  
Waiting for an invite to never come along  
I am the latest colors I sing the newest songs  
I read all the lyrics so I can sing along  
I am the latest colors I hate the newest songs  
I can't stand the lyrics I'd never sing along  
I'll never sing along  
I can't fake it I'll just make it on my own  
I'll never sing along  
I can't blame them I'll just maim them on my throne  
I'll never sing along  
I can't fake it I'll just make it on my own  
I'll never sing along  
I can't blame them I've just got to get to my throne  
Get to my throne
