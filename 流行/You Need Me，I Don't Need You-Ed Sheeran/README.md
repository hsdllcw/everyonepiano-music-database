### You Need Me, I Don't Need You歌词：

Now I’m in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound  
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd  
That’s you now, ciao, seems that life is great now  
See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud  
And I can’t, no, I won’t hush  
I’ll say the words that make you blush  
I’m gonna sing this now

Oh oh

See, I’m true, my songs are where my heart is  
I’m like glue, I stick to other artists  
I’m not you, now that would be disastrous  
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures  
See, I’m real, I do it all, it’s all me  
I’m not fake, don’t ever call me lazy  
I won’t stay put, give me the chance to be free  
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

‘Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you  
You need me, man, I don’t need you  
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all  
You need me, man, I don’t need you

You need me, man, I don’t need you  
You need me, man, I don’t need you  
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all  
You need me

I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse  
Hell, don't need another word-smith to make my tune sell  
Call yourself a singer-writer - you’re just bluffing  
Your name’s on the credits and you didn’t write nothing  
I sing fast, I know that all my shit’s cool  
I will blast and I didn’t go to Brit School  
I came fast with the way I act, right  
I can’t last if I’m smoking on a crack pipe

And I won’t be a product of my genre  
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are  
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya  
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia  
And musically I’m demonstrating  
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating  
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me  
‘A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi’

‘Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you  
You need me, man, I don’t need you  
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all  
You need me, man, I don’t need you

You need me, man, I don’t need you  
You need me, man, I don’t need you  
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all  
You need me

'Cause with the lyrics I’ll be aiming it right  
I won’t stop 'til my name's in lights  
At stadium heights with Damien Rice  
On red carpets, now I’m on Arabian Nights  
Because I’m young I know my brother's gonna give me advice  
Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper  
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah.  
The game's over but now I’m on a new level  
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal  
People think that I’m bound to blow up  
I’ve done around about a thousand shows  
But I haven’t got a house plus I live on a couch  
So you believe the lyrics when I’m singing them out, wow  
From day one, I’ve been prepared  
With vo5 wax for my ginger hair  
So now I’m back to the sofa, giving a dose of what the future holds  
'Cause it’s another day  
Plus I'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic  
Gonna be breaking into other people’s tunes when I chase it  
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift  
Into another rapper's shoes using new laces  
I'm selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers  
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors  
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back  
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache  
I hit back when the pen hurts me  
I’m still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee  
I’m still the same as a year ago  
But more people hear me though  
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos  
I’m always doing shows if I’m not I’m in the studio  
Truly broke, never growing up call me Rufio  
Melody music maker  
Reading all the papers  
They say I’m up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator .

'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you  
You need me, man, I don’t need you  
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all  
You need me, man, I don’t need you

You need me, man, I don’t need you  
You need me, man, I don’t need you  
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all  
You need me, man, I don’t need you
