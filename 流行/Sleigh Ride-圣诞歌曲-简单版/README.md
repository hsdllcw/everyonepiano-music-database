### Sleigh Ride歌词：

Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-ing  
Ring ting tingle-ing too  
Come on it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you  
Outside the snow is falling  
And friends are calling Yoo Hoo  
Come on it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you  
Our cheeks are nice and rosy  
And comfy cozy are we  
We're snuggled up together like two  
Birds of a feather would be  
Let's take the road before us  
And sing a chorus or two  
Come on it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you  
Our cheeks are nice and rosy  
And comfy cozy are we  
We're snuggled up together like two  
Birds of a feather would be  
Let's take the road before us  
And sing a chorus or two  
Come on it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you
