### I Do歌词：

Thought I was good, I was good on my own, I was alright  
Thought I was grown and the strangers I known, they were alright  
Thought that I knew everything, never wrong, I was alright  
Oh, I was good, I was good on my own, I was alright  
Oh, I lived a whole life  
Thinking I knew how my  
Heart could handle love  
Love I thought I knew  
Everything before us  
Was stretching out my heart just  
So it could be big enough to beat for two  
Never understood why  
People always say "Love chooses you"  
Now I do, now I do  
Didn't ever think that  
I could ever say "I promise you"  
And now I do, now I do  
Now I do  
This is the road, we can see where it goes together  
You are my home and I know I can stay forever  
Oh, I lived a whole life  
Thinking I knew how my  
Heart could handle love  
Love I thought I knew  
Everything before us  
Was stretching out my heart just  
So it could be big enough to beat for two  
Never understood why  
People always say "Love chooses you"  
Now I do, now I do  
Didn't ever think that  
I could ever say "I promise you"  
And now I do, now I do  
Now I do  
I do  
Now I do  
I do  
Used to be a time when I thought that I had nothing to lose  
But now I do, now I do  
Never understood why  
People always say "Love chooses you"  
Now I do (Now I do)  
Now I do (Now I do)  
Didn't ever think that  
I could ever say "I promise you"  
And now I do, now I do  
Now I do  
I do  
Now I do  
I do
