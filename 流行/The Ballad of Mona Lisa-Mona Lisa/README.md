_The Ballad of Mona Lisa_ 出自Panic! at the Disco的专辑Vices & Virtues。Panic! At
The
Disco是一支美国朋克乐队，早在21世纪初便已成立。这支乐队有过一些成就，但并没有特别出众，始终在小圈子里流行，直到最近几年，才忽然有了彻底崛起的姿态，在各类音乐榜单很有进步外，其独特风格的MV也得到年轻人的追捧。这和该乐队放弃一些硬核朋克内容，更向社会主流价值观迎合有关。

### The Ballad of Mona Lisa歌词：

She paints her fingers with a close precision  
He starts to notice empty bottles of gin  
And takes a moment to assess the sin she's paid for  
A lonely speaker in a conversation  
Her words are spinning through his ears again  
There's nothing wrong with just a taste of what you've paid for  
Say what you mean' tell me I'm right  
And let the sun rain down on me  
Give me a sign' I want to believe  
Woah' Woah' Woah' Woah' oh  
Mona Lisa' you're guaranteed to run this town  
Woah' Woah' Woah' Woah' oh  
Mona Lisa' I'd pay to see you frown  
He senses something' call it desperation  
Another dollar' another day  
And if she had the proper words to say'  
She would tell him  
But she'd have nothing left to sell him  
Say what you mean' tell me I'm right  
And let the sun rain down on me  
Give me a sign' I want to believe  
Woah' Woah' Woah' Woah' oh  
Mona Lisa' you're guaranteed to run this town  
Woah' Woah' Woah' Woah' oh  
Mona Lisa' I'd pay to see you frown  
Mona Lisa' wear me out  
Pleased to please ya  
Mona Lisa' wear me out  
Say what you mean' tell me I'm right  
And let the sun rain down on me  
Give me a sign' I want to believe  
Woah' Woah' Woah' Woah' oh  
Mona Lisa' you're guaranteed to run this town  
Woah' Woah' Woah' Woah' oh  
Mona Lisa' I'd pay to see you frown  
Say what you mean' tell me I'm right  
And let the sun rain down on me  
Give me a sign' I want to believe  
There's nothing wrong with just a taste of what you've paid for
