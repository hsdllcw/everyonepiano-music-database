### Lonely歌词：

I'm slowly killing myself  
I'm trying so hard at the back of the shelf  
It's just the same every day  
I'm writing these songs that will never get played  
I get told what's wrong and what's right  
I don't have a romantic life  
And everyone's dying  
So I keep on trying to make them proud before they are gone  
Oh can't someone help me  
Oh please someone help me  
I don't care anyone anything  
'Cause I'm so sick of being so lonely  
Miss all my family  
I don't care anyone anything  
'Cause I'm so sick of being so lonely  
I'm spending more than I earn  
Drink all the time to forget I'm not her  
'Cause I go to parties sometimes  
And I'll kiss a boy and pretend for the night  
'Cause I don't know much about me  
I'm still ashamed of who I used to be  
So I try way too hard but I still miss the mark to fit in  
Fit in  
Help me  
Oh please someone help me  
I don't care anyone anything  
'Cause I'm so sick of being so lonely  
I miss all my family  
God I don't care anyone anything  
'Cause I'm so sick of being so lonely  
I don't care anyone anything  
'Cause I'm so sick of being so lonely
