### Na Na Na (Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na)歌词：

[Spoken intro:]  
The future is bulletproof  
The aftermath is secondary  
It's time to do it now and do it loud  
Killjoys  
Make some noise

(Na na na...)

Drugs, gimme drugs, gimme drugs  
I don't need it, but I'll sell what you got  
Take the cash and I'll keep it  
Eight legs to the wall  
Hit the gas, kill them all  
And we crawl, and we crawl, and we crawl  
You be my detonator

Love, gimme love, gimme love  
I don't need it, but I'll take what I want from your heart  
And I'll keep it in a bag, in a box  
Put an X on the floor  
Gimme more, gimme more, gimme more  
Shut up and sing it with me

(Na na na...)

From mall security  
To every enemy  
We're on your property  
Standing in V formation

(Na na na...)

Let's blow an artery  
Eat plastic surgery  
Keep your apology  
Give us more detonation

(More! Gimme more! Gimme more!)

Oh, let me tell you 'bout the sad man  
Shut up and let me see your jazz hands  
Remember when you were a madman  
Thought you was Batman  
And hit the party with a gas can  
Kiss me you animal

(Na na na...)

You run the company  
Fuck like a Kennedy  
I think we'd rather be  
Burning your information

(Na na na...)

Let's blow an artery  
Eat plastic surgery  
Keep your apology  
Give us more detonation

And right here  
Right now  
All the way in Battery City  
The little children  
Raise their open filthy palms  
Like tiny daggers up to heaven  
And all the juvee halls  
And the Ritalin rats  
Ask angels made from neon  
And fucking garbage  
Scream out, "What will save us?"  
And the sky opened up

Everybody wants to change the world  
Everybody wants to change the world  
But no one, no one wants to die  
Wanna try, wanna try, wanna try  
Wanna try, wanna try, now  
I'll be your detonator

(Na na na...)

Make no apology  
It's death or victory  
On my authority  
Crash and burn  
Young and loaded

Drop like a bullet shell  
Dress like a sleeper cell  
I'd rather go to hell  
Than be in purgatory  
Cut my hair  
Gag and bore me  
Pull this pin  
Let this world explode
