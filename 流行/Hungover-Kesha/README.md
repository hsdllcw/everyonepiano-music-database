### Hungover歌词：

And now the sun is rising  
Now the long walk back home (back home)  
There's just so many faces,  
But no one I need to know (need to know)  
In the dark I can fight it, I fake 'til I'm numb  
But in the bright light,  
I taste you on my tongue  
Now the party's over  
And everybody's gone  
I'm left here with myself and I wonder what went wrong  
And now my heart is broken  
Like the bottles on the floor  
Does it really matter?  
Or am I just hung over you?  
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah  
Or am I just hungover?  
Even my dirty laundry  
Everything just smells like you (like you)  
And now my head is throbbing  
Every song is out of tune  
Just like you  
In the dark I can fight 'til it disappears  
But in the daylight  
I taste you in my tears  
And now the party's over,  
And everybody's gone  
I'm left here with myself and I wonder what went wrong  
And now my heart is broken  
Like the bottles on the floor  
Does it really matter?  
Or am I just hung over you?  
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah  
Or am I just hungover?  
Now I've got myself looking like a mess  
Standing alone here at the end trying to pretend but no,  
I put up my fight  
But this is it this time (this time)  
'cause I'm here in the end, trying to pretend  
I'm here in the end, trying to pretend  
Oh, oh  
And now the party's over,  
And everybody’s gone  
I'm left here with myself and I wonder what went wrong  
And now my heart is broken  
Like the bottles on the floor  
Does it really matter?  
Or am I just hung over you?  
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah  
Or am I just hungover?  
[x2]  
Ah ah ah  
Or am I just hungover?
