### Naked歌词：

Hey you there  
Can we take it to the next level  
Baby do you dare  
Don't be scared  
'Cause if you can say the words  
I don't know why I should care  
'Cause here I am  
I'm giving all I can  
But all you ever do is mess it up  
Yeah I'm right here  
I'm trying to make it clear  
That getting half of you just ain't enough  
I'm not going to wait until you're done  
Pretending you don't need anyone  
I'm standing here naked  
Naked naked  
I'm standing here naked  
Naked naked  
I'm not going to try 'til you decide  
You're ready to swallow all your pride  
I'm standing here naked  
Naked naked  
I'm standing here naked  
Naked naked  
Hey get out  
I've got nothing left to give  
And you give me nothing now  
Read my mouth  
If you ever want me back  
Then your walls need breaking down  
'Cause here I am  
I'm giving all I can  
But all you ever do is mess it up  
Yeah I'm right here  
I'm trying to make it clear  
That getting half of you just ain't enough  
I'm not going to wait until you're done  
Pretending you don't need anyone  
I'm standing here naked  
Naked naked  
I'm standing here naked  
Naked naked  
I'm not going to try 'til you decide  
You're ready to swallow all your pride  
I'm standing here naked  
Naked naked  
I'm standing here naked  
Naked naked  
I wanna give you everything  
I wanna give you everything  
I wanna give you everything  
I wanna give you everything  
I'm not going to wait until you're done  
'Cause you pretended you don't need anyone  
Can't you see that I'm naked  
Naked naked  
Oh you see that I'm naked  
Naked naked  
I'm not going to try 'til you decide  
You're ready to swallow all your pride  
I'm standing here naked  
Naked naked  
I'm standing here naked  
Naked naked  
I'm standing  
I'm standing here
