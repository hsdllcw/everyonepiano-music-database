### Both歌词：

Southside  
If Young Metro don’t trust you, I’m gon’ shoot you  
I got so many felonies, I might can’t never go to Canada  
But Drake said he gon’ pull some strings, so let me check my calendar  
I just popped me one of them one what-you-call-its and it boosted my stamina  
Now I’m fucking her on the banister, guess I just East Atlanta’d her  
I’m in an all-red drop tarantula, fuck a Challenger  
Damn these hoes ain’t got no manners, bruh, where’s the manager?  
I keep throwing rubber bandies up, hoe, pull your panties up  
Cause you fuck like a granny fuck, you’re just an amateur  
This Patek Philipe gon’ make this crooked judge try throw the book at me  
I look like half a million worth of heroin when she look at me  
But you ain’t gotta fuck with me, my nig, but you’re stuck with me  
But how you called the cops on me, my nig? You grew up with me  
I don’t usually do this unless I’m drunk or I’m high  
But I’m both right now, got me talking about my life  
I don’t usually do this unless I’m drunk or I’m high  
But I’m both right now  
I don’t usually do this unless I’m drunk or I’m high  
But I’m both right now and I need ya in my life  
I don’t usually do this unless I’m drunk or I’m high  
But I’m both right now  
Yeah, I’m both  
Yeah, I had a drink, yeah, I smoked  
Yeah, you think I need you but I don’t  
Just left out Dubai with all my folk  
Open water, my location is remote  
Shout-out Yachty but this ain’t a Lil Boat  
This some shit I wrote about when I was broke  
See, the power of the mind is not a joke  
Man, I said that I would do it and I did  
Used to get left-overs out the fridge  
Nobody was famous where I lived  
Till I got it jumping at the crib  
Took a lot to be able to give, I mean  
I don’t usually do this unless I’m drunk or I’m high  
But I’m both right now, got me talking about my life  
I don’t usually do this unless I’m drunk or I’m high  
But I’m both right now  
I don’t usually do this unless I’m drunk or I’m high  
But I’m both right now and I need ya in my life  
I don’t usually do this unless I’m drunk or I’m high  
But I’m both right now
