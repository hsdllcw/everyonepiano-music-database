### Something in the Way You Move歌词：

It's the strangest feeling  
Feeling this way for you  
There's something in the way you move  
Something in the way you move  
With you I’m never healing  
It’s heartache through and through  
There's something in the way you move  
I don’t know what it is you do  
Not one bone in your body good enough for me  
But this heart is open, bloodstain on my sleeve  
When our eyes meet, I can only see the end  
But tonight I'm here, yours again

But tonight I'm gonna lose it all  
Playing with fire, I was the first to fall  
Heart is sinking like a cannonball  
Baby, kill it, what you waiting for?

Something in the way you move  
There's something in the way you do it  
Something in the way you move  
Oh  
There's something in the way you move  
Something in the way you do it  
Something in the way you move  
Oh  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

There's an evil night air, the stars don't shine tonight, (night)  
There's something in the way you do  
There's something in the way you  
Push me closer, further  
Break me just enough  
Your lies always seem so true  
There's nothing left for me to lose  
There's not one thing I can do to change your ways  
But I can't sit back and take the lonely days  
When our eyes meet, I can only see the end  
And tonight the rain pours again

But tonight I'm gonna lose it all  
Playing with fire, I was the first to fall  
Heart is sinking like a cannonball  
Baby, kill it, what you waiting for?

Something in the way you move  
There's something in the way you do it  
Something in the way you move  
Oh  
There's something in the way you move  
Something in the way you do it  
Something in the way you move  
Oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

But tonight I'm gonna lose it all  
Playing with fire, I was the first to fall  
Heart is sinking like a cannonball  
Baby, kill it, what you waiting for?

Something in the way you move  
There's something in the way you do it  
Something in the way you move  
Oh  
There's something in the way you move  
Something in the way you do it  
Something in the way you move  
Oh
