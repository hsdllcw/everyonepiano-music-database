### So Yesterday歌词：

you can change your life  
(if you wanna)  
you can change your clothes  
(if you wanna)  
if you change your mind  
well that's the way it goes  
but i'm gonna keep your jeans  
and your old black hat  
[cuz i wanna]  
they look good on me,  
you're never gonna get them back  
at least not today, not today, not today, cuz...  
if it's over let it go and  
come tomorrow it will seem  
so yesterday, so yesterday  
i'm just a bird that's already flown away  
laugh it off, let it go and  
when you wake up it will seem  
so yesterday, so yesterday  
haven't you heard that i'm gonna be okay?  
you can say you're bored  
(if you wanna)  
you can act real tough  
(if you wanna)  
you can say you're torn  
but i've heard enough  
thank you, you made my mind up for me  
when you started to ignore me  
you won't see a single tear  
it isn't gonna happen here  
at least not today, not today, not today, cuz...  
if it's over let it go and  
come tomorrow it will seem  
so yesterday, so yesterday  
i'm just a bird that's already flown away  
laugh it off, let it go and  
when you wake up it will seem  
so yesterday, so yesterday  
haven't you heard that i'm gonna be okay?  
if you're over me  
i'm already over you  
if it's all been done  
what is left to do?  
how can i hang up if the line is dead?  
if you wanna walk  
i'm a step ahead  
if you're moving on  
i'm already gone  
if the light is off  
then it isn't on  
at least not today, not today, not today, cuz...  
if it's over let it go and  
come tomorrow it will seem  
so yesterday, so yesterday  
i'm just a bird that's already flown away  
laugh it off, let it go and  
when you wake up it will seem  
so yesterday, so yesterday  
haven't you heard that you're...so yesterday  
(so yesterday)  
if it's over let it go and  
come tomorrow it will seem  
so yesterday, so yesterday  
i'm just a bird that's already flown away  
laugh it off, let it go and  
when you wake up it will seem  
so yesterday, so yesterday  
haven't you heard that i'm gonna be okay?
