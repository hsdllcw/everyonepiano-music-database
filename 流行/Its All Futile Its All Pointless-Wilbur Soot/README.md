### It's All Futile! It's All Pointless!歌词：

I lost the passion that comes with living  
Since I started university  
I took a geography course to learn the datelines  
And maybe use a sextant  
But now I just press facsimiles  
And you're exactly who you wanted to be  
That's what you said  
'Cause you wanna watch TV and sleep all day and lay in bed but  
You're forgetting that I've got to go to work and eat my food  
And pay my rent and reproduce and feed those kids  
And maybe use a sextant  
I don't miss you  
I miss the thought of what we were  
This is the part where I shut up and let you infest my brain  
Wrap your arms around my cortex, dig you in and let you drain  
You'll never get rid of me, oh I'm like a fucking disease  
I'll make a home in your gut  
'Cause it's somewhere warm to sleep  
What was your thought when you realised  
You'll never feel naive love again?  
Was it pain or was it sickness?  
Were you proud of who you'd been?  
The shyness waiting for his phone calls  
Replaced by apathy 'n' dating apps  
You held his hands, it felt like flying  
Now he's just another man  
You'd rather he was inside than beside you  
But he's talking marriage and a future  
He's picking a lock he doesn't go into  
Less knife in a wound, he's a suture  
I don't miss you  
I miss the thought of what we were  
This is the part where I shut up and let you infest my brain  
But it's okay, it's a strategy to ensure I remain  
You'll never get rid of me, well I'm like a fucking disease  
I'll make a home in your gut  
'Cause it's somewhere warm to sleep  
It's okay  
It's okay  
Eat my rent and eat my food  
And eat my dues and eat those kids  
And maybe use a sextant
