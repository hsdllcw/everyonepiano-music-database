### Bluebird歌词：

Ooh  
Ooh  
Yeah I'm a turner  
I turn pages all the time  
Don't like where I'm at  
34 was bad so I just turn to 35  
Yeah I'm a keeper  
I keep digging down for the deep  
Like the records I'm playing  
They might keep you waiting  
But you know I'm only playing for keeps  
And if the house just keeps on winning  
I got a wildcard up on my sleeve  
And if love keeps giving me lemons  
I'll just mix 'em in my drink  
And if the whole wide world stops singing  
And all the stars go dark  
I'll keep a light on in my soul  
Keep a bluebird in my heart  
Well I'm a giver  
Yeah and I'm still giving 'em hell  
Forgiving's pretty hard  
So I made an art out of forgettin' 'em well  
Yeah I'm a rhymer  
I can turn 20 cents into a 10  
And if I get confused and I start to lose  
I rhyme a dime 'til it all makes sense  
And if the house just keeps on winning  
I got a wildcard up on my sleeve  
And if love keeps giving me lemons  
I'll just mix 'em in my drink  
And if the whole wide world stops singing  
And all the stars go dark  
I turn a light on in my soul  
And keep a bluebird in my heart  
Ooh  
Ooh  
And if the house just keeps on winning  
I got a wildcard up on my sleeve  
And if love starts giving me lemons  
Just mix 'em in my drink  
And if the whole wide world stops singing  
And all the stars go dark  
I'll keep a light on in my soul  
Keep a bluebird in my heart  
I'll keep a light on in my soul  
Keep a bluebird in my heart  
Keep a bluebird in my heart  
Ooh  
And the bluebird sings  
Ooh
