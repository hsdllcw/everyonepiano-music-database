### 18歌词：

[Harry:]  
I got a heart  
And I got a soul  
Believe me I will use them both  
We made a start  
Be it a false one, I know  
Baby, I don't want to feel alone

[Zayn:]  
So kiss me where I lay down  
My hands pressed to your cheeks  
A long way from the playground

[Harry:]  
I have loved you since we were 18  
Long before we both thought the same thing  
To be loved and to be in love  
All I could do is say that these arms were made for holding you  
I wanna love like you made me feel when we were 18

[Niall:]  
We took a chance  
God knows we tried  
Yet all along, I knew we'd be fine

[Liam:]  
So pour me a drink, oh, love,  
Let's split the night wide open and we'll see everything  
We can livin' love in slow motion, motion, motion

[Zayn:]  
So kiss me where I lay down  
My hands pressed to your cheeks  
A long way from the playground

[All:]  
I have loved you since we were 18  
Long before we both thought the same thing  
To be loved and to be in love  
And all I could do is say that these arms were made for holding you, oh  
And I wanna love like you made me feel when we were 18

[Niall:]  
When we were 18  
Oh, Lord, when we were 18

[Zayn:]  
Kiss me where I lay down  
My hands pressed to your cheeks  
A long way from the playground

[Louis:]  
I have loved you since we were 18  
Long before we both thought the same thing

[Harry:]  
To be loved and to be in love

[All:]  
And all I could do is say that these arms were made for holding you  
I wanna love like you made me feel when we were 18  
I wanna love like you made me feel when we were 18  
I wanna love like you made me feel when we were 18
