### Got It On Me歌词：

Look  
Have mercy on me have  
Mercy on my soul  
Don't let my heart turn cold  
Have mercy on me  
Have mercy on my soul  
Don't let my heart turn cold  
Have mercy on many men  
Many many many many men  
Wish death 'pon me  
Yeah I don't cry no mo'  
I don't look to the sky no mo'  
'Cause I got it on me

You can run up if you want  
F**k is you talking 'bout  
Look

Keep two fours like I'm Kobe  
Is you ridin' or you hidin'  
If you slidin' then you owe me  
Owe me  
Run up catch cold feet

Want some Ray-Bans 'cause I'm a OG  
This AR be my trophy  
Shoot first n***a shoot back

I don't look to the sky no mo'

Shoot first and do yourself a favor  
Report like I'm Craig Sager  
Back out n***as ain't with the bluffin'

Ten toes on your block

Floss your b***h right back  
And I don't politic

And get a light pack

Don't let my heart turn cold

'Cause I got it on me

You can run up if you want
