### Mask歌词：

Secure the bag know what I mean  
Banrisk on the beat  
Ayo Perish this is hot boy  
I wear a mask with a smile for hours at a time  
Stare at the ceiling while I hold back what's on my mind  
And when they ask me how I'm doing  
I say I'm just fine  
And when they ask me how I'm doing  
I say I'm just fine  
But the fact is  
I can never get off of my mattress  
And all that they can ask is  
Why are you so sad kid  
Why are you so sad kid  
That's what the mask is  
That's what the point of the mask is  
So you can see I'm tryin'  
You won't see me cryin'  
I'll just keep on smilin' I'm good  
Yeah I'm good  
And it just keeps on pilin'  
It's so terrifying  
But I keep on smilin' I'm good  
Yeah I'm good  
I've been carin' too much for so long  
Been comparin' myself for so long  
Been wearin' a smile for so long it's real  
So long it's real so long it's real  
Always bein' judged by a bunch of strange faces  
Scared to go outside haven't seen the light in ages  
But I've been places  
So I'm okay-ish so I'm okay-ish  
Yeah I'm okay b***h  
But the fact is  
I need help I'm failin' all my classes  
They think that I need glasses  
I just really wish that I could pass this  
Wish that I could pass this  
That's what the mask is  
That's what the point of the mask is  
So you can see I'm tryin'  
You won't see me cryin'  
I'll just keep on smilin' I'm good  
Yeah I'm good  
And it just keeps on pilin'  
It's so terrifying  
But I keep on smilin' I'm good  
Yeah I'm good  
I've been carin' too much for so long  
Been comparin' myself for so long  
Been wearin' a smile for so long it's real  
So long it's real so long it's real  
So long it's real  
So long it's real
