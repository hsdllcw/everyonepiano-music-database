### Craigie Hill歌词：

It being in the springtime and the small birds they were singing  
Down by yon shady harbour I carelessly did stray  
The thrushes they were warbling  
The violets they were charming  
To view fond lovers talking a while I did delay  
She said my dear don't leave me for another season  
Though fortune does be pleasing I'll go along with you  
I'll forsake friends and relations and bid this Irish nation  
And to the bonny Bann banks forever I'll bid adieu  
He said my dear don't grieve or yet annoy my patience  
You know I love you dearly the more I'm going away  
I'm going to a foreign nation to purchase a plantation  
To comfort us hereafter all in America  
Then after a short while a fortune does be pleasing  
I'll cause them for two smile at our late going away  
We'll be happy as Queen Victoria all in her greatest glory  
We'll be drinking wine and porter all in America  
If you were in your bed lying and thinking on dying  
The sight of the lovely Bann banks your sorrow you'd give o'er  
Or if you're down one hour down in yon shady bower  
Pleasure would surround you you'd think on death no more  
Then fare you well sweet Cragie Hills where often times I've roved  
I never thought my childhood days I'd part you any more  
Now we're sailing on the ocean for honour and promotion  
And the bonny boats are sailing way down by Doorin shore
