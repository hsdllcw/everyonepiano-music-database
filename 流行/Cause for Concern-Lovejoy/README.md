### Cause for Concern歌词：

So what's it to you?  
You're down another 8 ball  
I haven't even got a cue  
And you look dreadful  
When you jump to what you'll resort to  
Singing, "Chance, we ain't gonna hurt you"  
When there's fuck-all-else to do  
You could eat the foam from the headrest  
You could knock the wind out of my breath  
You could kick the teeth into my head  
There's no cause for concern  
So what's it to you?  
You're down another 8 ball  
I haven't even got a cue  
And you look dreadful  
When you jump to what you'll resort to  
Singing, "Chance, we ain't gonna hurt you"  
When there's fuck-all-else to do  
You could eat the foam from the headrest  
(I said there's no cause for)  
You could knock the wind out of my breath  
(I said there's no cause for)  
And you could kick the teeth into my head  
Still, there's no cause for concern  
We ain't gonna hurt you  
We ain't gonna hurt you  
We ain't gonna hurt you  
'Cause when there's fuck-all-else to do  
We could eat the foam from the headrest  
(I said there's no cause for)  
You could suck the wind out of my breath  
(I said there's no cause for)  
And you could kiss the teeth into my head  
And still, there's no cause for concern  
I said there's no cause for concern
