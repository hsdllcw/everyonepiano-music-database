### Castle On The Hill歌词：

When I was six years old  
I broke my leg  
And I was running from my brother and his friends  
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down  
I was younger then  
Take me back to when  
I found my heart and broke it here  
Made my friends and lost them through the years  
And I've not seen the boarding fields in so long  
I know I've grown  
I can't wait to go home  
I'm on my way  
Driving at nineteen down those  
Country lanes  
Singing to Tiny Dancer  
And I miss the way you made me feel  
It's real, we watched the sunset  
Over the castle on the hill  
Fifteen years old  
And smoking hand-rolled cigarettes  
Running from the law through the backfields  
And getting drunk with my friends  
Had my first kiss on a Friday night  
I don't reckon that I did it right  
But I was younger then  
Take me back to when  
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid  
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight  
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long  
Oh, how we've grown  
I can't wait to go home  
I'm on my way  
Driving at nineteen down those  
Country lanes  
Singing to Tiny Dancer  
And I miss the way you made me feel  
It's real, we watched the sunset  
Over the castle on the hill  
Over the castle on the hill  
Over the castle on the hill  
One friend left to sell clothes  
One works down by the coast  
One had two kids but lives alone  
One's brother overdosed  
One's already on his second wife  
One's just barely getting by  
But these people raised me  
And I can't wait to go home  
And I'm on my way  
I still remember these old  
Country lanes  
When we did not know the answers  
And I miss the way you made me feel  
It's real, we watched the sunset  
Over the castle on the hill  
Over the castle on the hill  
Over the castle on the hill
