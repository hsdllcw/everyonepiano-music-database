### Talk歌词：

Can't we just talk  
Can't we just talk  
Talk about where we're goin'  
Before we get lost let me out first  
Can't get what we want without knowin'  
I've never felt like this before  
I apologize if I'm movin' too far  
Can't we just talk  
Can't we just talk  
Figure out where we're goin'  
Yeah started off right  
I can see it in your eyes  
I can tell that you're wantin' more  
What's been on your mind  
There's no reason we should hide  
Tell me somethin' I ain't heard before  
Oh I've been dreamin' 'bout it  
And it's you I'm on  
So stop thinkin' 'bout it  
Can't we just talk  
Can't we just talk  
Talk about where we're goin'  
Before we get lost let me out first  
Yeah  
Can't get what we want without knowin'  
No  
I've never felt like this before  
I apologize if I'm movin' too far  
Can't we just talk  
Can't we just talk  
Figure out where we're goin'  
Oh nah  
Penthouse view left some flowers in the room  
I'll make sure I leave the door unlocked  
Now I'm on the way swear I won't be late  
I'll be there by five o'clock  
Oh you've been dreamin' 'bout it  
And I'm what you want  
So stop thinkin' 'bout it  
Can't we just talk  
Oh can't we just talk  
Talk about where we're goin'  
Before we get lost let me out first  
Can't get what we want without knowin'  
I've never felt like this before  
I apologize if I'm movin' too far  
Can't we just talk  
Can't we just talk  
Figure out where we're goin'  
Figure out where we're goin'
