### Protect the Land歌词：

The big gun tells you what your life is worth  
What do we deserve before we end the earth  
If they will try to push you far away  
Would you stay  
And take a stand  
Would you stay with gun in hand  
They protect the land  
They protect the land  
Those who protect the land  
Those who protect the land  
Those who protect  
The enemy of man is his own decay  
If they&apos;re evil now then evil they will stay  
They will try to push you far away  
Would you stay and take a stand  
Would you stay with gun in hand  
They protect the land  
They protect the land  
They protect the land  
Our history and victory and legacy we send  
From scavengers and invaders those who protect the land  
Those who protect the land  
Those who protect  
Those who protect the land  
Those who protect  
Some were forced to foreign lands  
Some would lay dead on the sand  
Would you stay and take command  
Would you stay with gun in hand  
With gun in hand  
They protect the land  
They protect the land  
They protect the land  
Our history and victory and legacy we send  
From scavengers and invaders those who protect the land  
Our history and victory and legacy we send  
From scavengers and invaders those who protect  
Those who protect the land  
Those who protect the land  
Those who protect  
Those who protect the land  
Those who protect
