**Be Kind双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Be Kind_ 是Marshmello联手Halsey一同合作的单曲。歌曲从短暂的嘈杂中把旋律与节奏切入，将密集的Hi-
Hat揉入旋律中，极大增强了歌曲饱满度。Halsey粗犷而独特的磁性嗓音向来都不乏情感塑造力，于旋律中自由穿梭，以这样唯美而深情的姿态成为整首歌情感表达的主轴。在密集的鼓组与若即若离的迷离电音的构架下，歌曲缓缓酿出了80年代复古舞曲的韵味。

这整首歌没有明显的过渡带，在强烈的叙述氛围中，Halsey将嗓间蕴含的情感层层剥开，在这片缥缈而迷幻的电音和弦铺底的旋律中，钢琴音色若隐若有着现，808鼓机佛蒙上一层薄雾而让音色变得柔和，温润的旋律与Halsey的款款深情相互浸染着，歌曲情感也在那句“I”的贯穿与冲击中酝酿至无尽。

### Be Kind歌词：

Wanna believe  
Wanna believe  
That you don't have a bad bone in your body  
But the bruises on your ego make you go wild wild wild yeah  
Wanna believe  
Wanna believe  
That even when you're stone cold  
You're sorry  
Tell me why you gotta be so outta your mind yea  
I know you're chokin' on your fears  
Already told you I'm right here  
I will stay by your side  
Every night  
I don't know why you hide from the one  
And close your eyes to the one  
Mess up and lie to the one that you love  
When you know you can cry to the one  
Always confide in the one  
You can be kind to the one that you love  
I  
I know you need I know you need  
The upper hand even when we aren't fighting  
Cuz in the past you had to prepare every time yeah  
Don't wanna leave don't wanna leave  
But if you're gonna fight then do it for me  
I know you're built to love but broken now so just try  
Yeah  
I know you're chokin' on your fears  
Already told you I'm right here  
I will stay by your side  
Every night  
I don't know why you hide from the one  
And close your eyes to the one  
Mess up and lie to the one that you love  
When you know you can cry to the one  
Always confide in the one  
You can be kind to the one that you love  
I  
I know it's hard for you but it's not fair  
Going sick in the head tryna get you there  
And I know it's hard for you but it's not fair  
It's not fair  
I don't know why you hide from the one  
And close your eyes to the one  
Mess up and lie to the one that you love  
When you know you can cry to the one  
Always confide in the one  
You can be kind to the one that you love  
I  
I  
When you know you can cry to the one  
Always confide in the one  
You can be kind to the one that you love  
I
