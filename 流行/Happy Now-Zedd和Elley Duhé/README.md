### Happy Now歌词：

You're a world away  
Somewhere in the crowd  
In a foreign place  
Are you happy now  
There's nothing left to say  
So I shut my mouth  
So won't you tell me babe  
Are you happy now  
You're the only one who can up and run  
Leave me just as empty as the day you came  
You hold all the cards  
All the broken hearts  
Strung over your shoulder  
Til it's all in vein  
And only you know the strength of your teeth  
Wash in the weight of your pockets so deep  
And lonely  
You're a world away  
Somewhere in the crowd  
In a foreign place  
Are you happy now  
There's nothing left to say  
So I shut my mouth  
So won't you tell me babe  
Are you happy now  
Are you happy now  
In the palm of your hands  
You can make me dance  
Spin me round in circles  
Til I'm wrapped in string  
You keep on talking sweet  
Til your fingers bleed  
But don't you dare ask me how I've been  
Now only you know the strength of your teeth  
Wash in the weight of your pockets so deep  
And lonely  
You're a world away  
Somewhere in the crowd  
In a foreign place  
Are you happy now  
There's nothing left to say  
So I shut my mouth  
So won't you tell me babe  
Are you happy now  
Are you happy now  
You're a world away  
Somewhere in the crowd  
In a foreign place  
Are you happy now  
There's nothing left to say  
So I shut my mouth  
So won't you tell me babe  
Are you happy now
