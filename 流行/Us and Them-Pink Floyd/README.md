**Us and Them** 是英国摇滚乐队Pink Floyd的歌曲，收录在其专辑The Dark Side of the Moon中。

而专辑Dark Side of the
Moon一个值得大书特书的地方就是它的音响效果。此张唱片的音响效果十分出色，它被HP列入他的TAS杂志的超级榜单中。经他的热炒，该唱片的LP版在美国被炒卖到了天价。仅唱片开头的心跳声有多沉才合适就不知考倒了多少音响师。

歌曲 _Us And Them_
是全碟旋律最优美的一首歌，歌词虽简单但内涵却很深奥，其深刻地提出了反战宣言“你我都是普通人，只有上帝知道我们会怎样选择命运。是在后方哭泣？还是在前线阵亡？昏暗之中，谁又知道我是谁？沮丧之时，谁会给我援助？”。

### Us and Them歌词：

Us and Them  
And after all we're only ordinary men  
Me, and you  
God only knows it's not what we would choose to do  
Forward he cried from the rear  
and the front rank died  
And the General sat, as the lines on the map  
moved from side to side  
Black and Blue  
And who knows which is which and who is who  
Up and Down  
And in the end it's only round and round and round  
Haven't you heard it's a battle of words  
the poster bearer cried  
Listen son, said the man with the gun  
There's room for you inside

"Well I mean, they're gonna kill ya, so like, if you give 'em a quick
sh...short, sharp shock, they don't do it again.  
Dig it? I mean he got off light, 'cause I coulda given 'I'm a thrashin' but I
only hit him once.  
It's only the difference between right and wrong innit? I mean good manners
don't cost nothing do they, eh?"

Down and Out  
It can't be helped but there's a lot of it about  
With, without  
And who'll deny that's what the fightings all about  
Get out of the way, it's a busy day  
And I've got things on my mind  
For want of the price of tea and a slice  
The old man died
