**Hallelujah双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Hallelujah_ 为加拿大著名游吟诗人、民谣歌手Leonard Cohen在1985年创作的歌曲。收录在其专辑"Various
Positions"中。其歌词充满诗意，内涵丰富，曲调缓慢忧伤，加上Leonard沧桑嗓音的低吟浅唱，演绎出了一种清淡而悠长的回味。

Hallelujah的版本很多，其中最有影响力的还是美国著名创作型歌手Jeff
Buckley的翻唱版本，被收录在其1994年的专辑"Grace"中。Jeff被U2的Bono形容为“噪海中的纯净一滴”，他的声音明丽甜蜜又性感飘渺，诠释起悲伤和记忆来却更令人印象深刻。

### Hallelujah歌词：

Now I've heard there was a secret chord  
That David played and it pleased the Lord  
But you don't really care for music do you  
It goes like this  
The fourth the fifth  
The minor fall the major lift  
The baffled king composing Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
Your faith was strong but you needed proof  
You saw her bathing on the roof  
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you  
She tied you  
To a kitchen chair  
She broke your throne and she cut your hair  
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah  
Hallelujah Hallelujah  
Hallelujah Hallelujah  
You say I took the name in vain  
I don't even know the name  
But if I did well really what's it to you  
There's a blaze of light  
In every word  
It doesn't matter which you heard  
The holy or the broken Hallelujah  
Hallelujah Hallelujah  
Hallelujah Hallelujah  
I did my best it wasn't much  
I couldn't feel so I tried to touch  
I've told the truth I didn't come to fool you  
And even though  
It all went wrong  
I'll stand before the Lord of Song  
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah  
Hallelujah Hallelujah  
Hallelujah Hallelujah  
Hallelujah Hallelujah  
Hallelujah Hallelujah  
Hallelujah Hallelujah  
Hallelujah Hallelujah  
Hallelujah Hallelujah  
Hallelujah Hallelujah  
Hallelujah
