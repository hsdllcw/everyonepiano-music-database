### Heavy歌词：

I don't like my mind right now  
Stacking up problems that are so unnecessary  
Wish that I could slow things down  
I wanna let go but there's comfort in the panic  
And I drive myself crazy  
Thinking everything's about me  
Yeah I drive myself crazy  
Cause I can't escape the gravity  
I'm holding on  
Why is everything so heavy  
Holding on  
So much more than I can carry  
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down  
If I just let go I'd be set free  
Holding on  
Why is everything so heavy  
You say that I'm paranoid  
But I'm pretty sure the world is out to get me  
It's not like I make the choice  
To let my mind stay so f**king messy  
I know I'm not the center of the universe  
But you keep spinning round me just the same  
I know I'm not the center of the universe  
But you keep spinning round me just the same  
I'm holding on  
Why is everything so heavy  
Holding on  
So much more than I can carry  
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down  
If I just let go I'd be set free  
Holding on  
Why is everything so heavy  
I know I'm not the center of the universe  
But you keep spinning round me just the same  
I know I'm not the center of the universe  
But you keep spinning round me just the same  
And I drive myself crazy  
Thinking everything's about me  
I'm holding on  
Why is everything so heavy  
Holding on  
So much more than I can carry  
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down  
If I just let go I'd be set free  
Holding on  
Why is everything so heavy  
Why is everything so heavy  
Why is everything so heavy
