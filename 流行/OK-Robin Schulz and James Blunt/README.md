### OK歌词：

I really need you  
I really need your love right now  
I'm fading fast  
Not gonna last  
I'm really stupid  
I'm burning up, I'm going down  
I win it back  
Don't even ask  
When I found myself in the middle, in the middle, in the middle  
Could you love me more, just a little, just a little  
Overcomplicate when it's simple, when it's simple, when it's simple  
Would you love me more, just a little  
So tell me now  
When every star falls from the sky  
And every last heart in the world breaks  
Oh hold me now  
When every ship is going down  
I don't feel nothing when I hear you say  
It's gonna be OK  
It's gonna be OK  
It's gonna be OK  
It's gonna be OK  
I'm really sorry  
Sorry I dragged you into this  
I overthink, that's all it is  
The way you love me  
The way you love me 'til the end  
The way you love me  
Oh yeah, it makes me king again  
When I found myself in the middle, in the middle, in the middle  
Could you love me more, just a little, just a little  
Overcomplicate when it's simple, when it's simple, when it's simple  
Would you love me more, just a little  
So tell me now  
When every star falls from the sky  
And every last heart in the world breaks  
Oh hold me now  
When every ship is going down  
I don't feel nothing when I hear you say  
It's gonna be OK  
It's gonna be OK  
It's gonna be OK  
It's gonna be OK  
It's gonna be OK  
It's gonna be OK  
It's gonna be OK  
It's gonna be OK  
It's gonna be OK  
It's gonna be OK  
It's gonna be OK  
It's gonna be OK  
It's gonna be OK  
When every star falls from the sky  
And every last heart in the world breaks  
It's gonna be OK  
When every ship is going down  
I don't feel nothing when I hear you say  
It's gonna be OK
