### Almost Love歌词：

Ah yeah, yeah, yeah  
The moment when the light is red before the go  
The moment when the curtain's down before the show  
The moment when you're done, but maybe just one more  
That's how I feel before I get you all alone  
We could give it a minute  
But what's the fun in a minute?  
When we could push all the limits, ah yeah  
Shirt hanging off my shoulders  
Both hands wanna hold you  
So baby, what's the hold up?  
Yeah, yeah  
Can you feel the tension rising?  
Now you're, now you're getting it close  
Now you're, now you're getting it close  
Almost love, it's almost love  
Speed this up 'cause I'm excited  
No more, no more taking it slow  
No more, no more taking it slow  
Almost love, it's almost love  
Almost love  
Almost love, but it could be love  
Almost love  
Almost love, but it could be love  
Almost lo-lo-love  
Almost love, but it could be love  
It could be love, it could be  
I want you like a midnight hour wants a view  
I want you like a loner wants an empty room  
I want you like a kiss that's long and overdue  
I need you more than I have ever needed you  
And we could give it a minute  
But what's the fun in a minute?  
When we could push all the limits, ah yeah  
Shirt hanging off my shoulders  
Both hands wanna hold you  
So baby, what's the hold up?  
Yeah  
Can you feel the tension rising?  
Now you're, now you're getting it close  
Now you're, now you're getting it close  
Almost love, it's almost love  
Speed this up 'cause I'm excited  
No more, no more taking it slow  
No more, no more taking it slow  
Almost love, it's almost love  
Almost love  
It's almost love, but it could be love  
Almost love  
Almost love, but it could be love  
Almost lo-lo-lo-lo-love  
Almost love, but it could be love  
It could be love  
It could be, yeah, oh no  
We could give it a minute  
But what's the fun in a minute?  
Can you feel the tension rising?  
Now you're getting it so close  
Now you're getting this so close  
Almost love, almost love  
Oh, 'cause I'm excited  
No more, no more taking it slow  
No more, no more taking it slow  
It's almost love  
Almost love, oh baby  
It's almost love, but it could be love  
'Cause it's almost love, but it could be love  
Almost love and you know  
Almost love  
But it could be love  
'Cause it's almost love, but it could be love  
Yeah, it could be love, eh
