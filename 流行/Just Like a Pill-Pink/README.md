### Just Like a Pill歌词：

I'm lyin' here on the floor where you left me  
I think I took too much  
I'm crying here, what have you done?  
I thought it would be fun

I can't stay on your life support,  
There's a shortage in the switch,  
I can't stay on your morphine,  
'Cause it's making me itch  
I said I tried to call the nurse again  
But she's being a little bitch,  
I think I'll get outta here, where I can

Run just as fast as I can  
To the middle of nowhere  
To the middle of my frustrated fears  
And I swear you're just like a pill  
Instead of makin' me better,  
You keep makin' me ill  
You keep makin' me ill

I haven't moved from the spot where you left me  
This must be a bad trip  
All of the other pills, they were different  
Maybe I should get some help

I can't stay on your life support,  
There's a shortage in the switch,  
I can't stay on your morphine,  
'Cause it's making me itch  
I said I tried to call the nurse again  
But she's being a little bitch,  
I think I'll get outta here, where I can

Run just as fast as I can  
To the middle of nowhere  
To the middle of my frustrated fears  
And I swear you're just like a pill  
Instead of makin' me better,  
You keep makin' me ill  
You keep makin' me ill

Run just as fast as I can  
To the middle of nowhere  
To the middle of my frustrated fears  
And I swear you're just like a pill  
Instead of makin' me better,  
You keep makin' me ill  
You keep makin' me ill

I can't stay on your life support,  
There's a shortage in the switch,  
I can't stay on your morphine,  
'Cause it's making me itch  
I said I tried to call the nurse again  
But she's being a little bitch,  
I think I'll get outta here, where I can

Run just as fast as I can  
To the middle of nowhere  
To the middle of my frustrated fears  
And I swear you're just like a pill  
Instead of makin' me better,  
You keep makin' me ill  
You keep makin' me ill
