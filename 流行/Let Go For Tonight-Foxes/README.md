Let Go For Tonight歌词：

演唱：Foxes  

  
Fell from the sky  
We fell from the sky and started walking  
Leaving our footprints on the ground  
It might be a prayer  
Or maybe a piece of conversation  
Wherever we go we make a sound  
So I call your name the only thing I know  
Is I need you here will you be gone forever  
All that I know all that I know  
Is we're here tonight  
Turn off the lights  
Let go for tonight baby  
Let love in your life and be shown  
Turn off the lights  
Let go for tonight baby  
Who needs sleep tonight  
I need to let go let go  
Let go let go turn off the lights  
Let love in you life baby  
Who needs sleep tonight  
I wanna drive  
I wanna drive into the open  
Looking for reasons I can't find  
So I call your name the only thing I know  
Is I need you here will you be gone forever  
All that I know all that I know  
Is we're here tonight  
Turn off the lights  
Let go for tonight baby  
Let love in your life and be shown  
Turn off the lights  
Let go for tonight baby  
Who needs sleep tonight  
I need to let go let go  
Let go let go turn off the lights  
Let love in your life baby  
Who needs sleep tonight  
I need to let go let go  
Let go let go  
I need to let go let go  
Before we gone gone gone  
So I call your name the only thing I know  
Is I need you here will you be gone forever  
All that I know all that I know  
Is I need you here will you be gone forever  
What do you want?  
I need you here will you be gone forever  
All that I know all that I know  
Is we're here tonight  
Turn off the lights  
Let go for tonight baby  
Let love in your life and be shown  
(Turn off the lights)  
Let go for tonight baby  
Who needs sleep tonight  
I need to let go let go  
Let go let go  
(Turn off the lights)  
Let love in your life baby  
Who needs sleep tonight  
I need to let go let go  
Let go let go  
I need to let go let go  
Fell from the sky  
We fell from the sky and started walking  
Leaving our footprints on the ground
