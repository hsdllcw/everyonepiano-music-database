### Parasite Eve歌词：

I got a fever don't breathe on me  
I'm a believer of nobody  
Won't let me leave 'cause I've seen something  
Hope I don't sneeze hope I don't ah  
Really we just wanna fear something  
Only pretending to feel something  
I know that you're dying to run  
I wanna turn you around  
It's the Parasite Eve  
'Cause you feel it in your stomach 'cause you know that it's coming for ya  
Leave your flowers and grieve  
Or forget about it soldier eh eh  
If you survive the infection  
Will you remember the lesson  
If the suspense doesn't kill you  
Something else will  
Now that I've planted my seed will you  
Answer the questions I need you to  
Quarantine all of the figments in that black hole  
You call a brain before it's too late  
Really we just wanna fear something  
Only pretending to feel something  
I know that you're dying to run  
I wanna turn you around  
It's the Parasite Eve  
'Cause you feel it in your stomach 'cause you know that it's coming for ya  
Leave your flowers and grieve  
Or forget about it soldier eh eh  
If you survive the infection  
Will you remember the lesson  
If the suspense doesn't kill you  
Something else will  
It's the Parasite Eve  
'Cause you feel it in your stomach 'cause you know that it's coming for ya  
Leave your flowers and grieve  
Or forget about it soldier eh eh  
If you survive the infection  
Will you remember the lesson  
If the suspense doesn't kill you  
Something else will  
It's the Parasite Eve  
'Cause you feel it in your stomach 'cause you know that it's coming for ya  
Leave your flowers and grieve  
Or forget about it soldier eh eh  
If you survive the infection  
Will you remember the lesson  
If the suspense doesn't kill you  
Something else will  
It's the Parasite Eve  
It's the Parasite Eve  
It's the Parasite Eve
