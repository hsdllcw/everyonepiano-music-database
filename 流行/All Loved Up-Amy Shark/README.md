### All Loved Up歌词：

And I hate to take off and land  
So you hold my hand  
And there's a man next to you with a killer view  
Of New York  
And somehow you managed to get me talking too much  
Yeah there's a rhythm  
Yeah there's a feeling  
Ohhh  
We've been kicking these words around too long  
I had a feeling we were close to something big  
A deep breath under a baseball cap  
One way ticket to a heart attack  
And I'm all loved up in the morning  
Take me with you  
And I'm all loved up in a world  
I can't explain  
And it's gonna be tough  
'Cause I got a few things to work through  
And I'm all loved up in a world  
I can't explain  
All loved up in a world I can't explain  
All loved up in a world I can't explain  
You talk about girls from the city that I've never met  
I act like I know things  
I don't  
I just like your voice  
And I get you I get you  
I get you telling me everything  
Yeah there's a rhythm  
Yeah there's a rhythm  
Yeah there's a feeling  
Ohhh  
We've been kicking these words around too long  
I had a feeling we were close to something big  
A deep breath under a baseball cap  
One way ticket to a heart attack  
And I'm all loved up in the morning  
Take me with you  
And I'm all loved up in a world  
I can't explain  
And it's gonna be tough  
'Cause I got a few things to work through  
And I'm all loved up in a world  
I can't explain  
All loved up in a world I can't explain  
All loved up in a world I can't explain  
Explain  
Explain  
All loved up in a world I can't explain  
Been living in a small town way too long  
Growing up just wanna do something big  
A deep breath under a baseball cap  
One way ticket to a heart attack  
And I'm all loved up in the morning  
Take me with you  
And I'm all loved up in a world  
I can't explain  
And it's gonna be tough  
'Cause I got a few things to work through  
And I'm all loved up in a world  
I can't explain  
All loved up in a world I can't explain  
All loved up in a world I can't explain  
All loved up in a world I can't explain
