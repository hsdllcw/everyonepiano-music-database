### Moral of the Story歌词：

So I never really knew you  
God I really tried to  
Blindsided addicted  
Thought we could really do this  
But really I was foolish  
Hindsight it's obvious  
Talking with my lawyer  
She said where'd you find this guy  
I said young people fall in love  
With the wrong people sometimes  
Some mistakes get made  
That's alright that's okay  
You can think that you're in love  
When you're really just in pain  
Some mistakes get made  
That's alright that's okay  
In the end it's better for me  
That's the moral of the story babe  
It's funny how a memory  
Turns into a bad dream  
When running wild turns volatile  
Remember how we painted our house  
Just like my grandparents did  
So romantic but we fought the whole time  
Should've seen the signs yeah  
Talking with my mother  
She said where'd you find this guy  
Said some people fall in love  
With the wrong people sometimes  
Some mistakes get made  
That's alright that's okay  
You can think that you're in love  
When you're really just in pain  
Some mistakes get made  
That's alright that's okay  
In the end it's better for me  
That's the moral of the story babe  
They say it's better to have loved and lost  
Than never to have loved at all  
That could be a load of s**t  
But I just need to tell you all  
Some mistakes get made  
That's alright that's okay  
You can think that you're in love  
When you're really just engaged  
Some mistakes get made  
That's alright that's okay  
In the end it's better for me  
That's the moral of the story  
Some mistakes get made  
That's alright that's okay  
You can think that you're in love  
When you're really just in pain  
Some mistakes get made  
That's alright that's okay  
In the end it's better for me  
That's the moral of the story babe
