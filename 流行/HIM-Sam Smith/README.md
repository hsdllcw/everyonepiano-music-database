### HIM歌词：

Holy Father  
We need to talk  
I have a secret  
That I can't keep  
I'm not the boy that  
You thought you wanted  
Please don't get angry  
Have faith in me  
Say I shouldn't be here but I can't give up his touch  
It is him I love  
It is him  
Don't you try and tell me that God doesn't care for us  
It is him I love  
It is him I love  
I walk the streets of Mississippi  
I hold my lover by the hand  
I feel you staring when he is with me  
How can I make you understand  
Say I shouldn't be here but I can't give up his touch  
It is him I love  
It is him  
Don't you try and tell me that God doesn't care for us  
It is him I love  
It is him I love  
Oh I love  
No no  
I love  
I love  
Him I love  
Him I love  
Him I love  
Him I love  
Him I love  
Him I love  
Him I love  
Him I love  
Him I love  
Holy Father  
Judge my sins  
I'm not afraid of what they will bring  
I'm not the boy that you thought you wanted  
I love him
