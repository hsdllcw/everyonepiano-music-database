### Fighting Demons歌词：

Run away  
In fear of me dying today  
Yeah, I run away  
In fear of me dying today, ah  
And I'm not the same  
Who said I was subject to change?  
My demons are breakin' out of their cage  
I'm praying that I see another day (Chill, chill)  
I said my demons are breakin' out of their cage  
On my knees, I pray for better days  
Chip, chip, cheerio, everything's all good, right?  
I got rich, I got rich, I'm livin' that fast life  
Couple M's in my bank account, I got cash, right?  
And that's supposed to make me happy  
I got a couple questions  
How come that shit don't ever make me happy?  
Money give me an erection  
But that don't mean it's gon' be everlasting  
Yeah, I know it's a blessing  
But how come it always feel like the devil plottin'  
And the devil watchin'?  
He see me buyin' all these watches  
Benjamin Franklin in my pockets  
Ooh, been a year of the glitz and the glam  
And the TV channels, brain's going scramble  
Scrambling sometimes 'cause this shit is hard to handle  
Demons in my heart (Yeah), they destroy me like a vandal (Ah)  
Take my hand  
Don't give up  
Take my hand  
Don't give up  
Yeah, I run away  
In fear of me dying today, ah  
And I'm not the same  
Who said I was subject to change?  
My demons are breakin' out of their cage  
I'm praying that I see another day (Chill, chill)  
I said my demons are breakin' out of their cage  
On my knees, I pray for better days  
Karma ain't what you think it is  
Super stressed, still handle all of my business  
Do the best I can, yes, I can  
Yes, I am, misfortune  
I know in the dark, they be lurking (Why?)  
Same way they lurk in your head when they get in your mind  
You don't wanna know what they're tryin' to find  
I'll protect your soul (Ah)  
Take my hand  
Don't give up  
Take my hand  
Don't give up  
Yeah, I run away  
In fear of me dying today, ah  
And I'm not the same  
Who said I was subject to change?  
My demons are breakin' out of their cage  
I'm praying that I see another day (Chill, chill)  
I said my demons are breakin' out of their cage  
On my knees, I pray for better days
