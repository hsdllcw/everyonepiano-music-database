### Birthday歌词：

I'm another year older  
I won't cry about you anymore  
Told my friends to come over to dye my hair  
It's not even the weekend  
And I'm wearing that dress I can't afford  
Giving life a new meaning without you there  
Do some stupid s**t maybe get a tattoo ahhhhh  
Whatever I can do to get my mind off you ahhhhh  
It's my birthday  
I'mma do what I like I'mma eat what I like I'mma kiss who I like  
It's my birthday  
I'mma do what I like I'mma wear what I like I'mma party tonight  
God d**n it's my birthday everybody love me  
Yeah yeah yeah look at me give me money  
D**n it's my birthday everybody love me  
And I ain't thinking 'bout you  
It's my birthday  
I blow out all the candles I can't even afford my rent  
So I'm not buying the drinks cos I'mma leave that to my friends  
Fall in love with everybody in the room  
That's what I do that's what I do  
Whatever I can do to get my mind off you  
That's what I do that's what I do  
It's my birthday  
I'mma do what I like I'mma eat what I like I'mma kiss who I like  
It's my birthday  
I'mma do what I like I'mma wear what I like I'mma party tonight  
God d**n it's my birthday everybody love me  
Yeah yeah yeah look at me give me money  
D**n it's my birthday everybody love me  
And I ain't thinking 'bout you  
It's my birthday  
Ain't got any wiser  
Gonna be hungover  
Never learn my lesson  
And I ain't gonna listen  
I don't really care cos  
It's my birthday  
I'mma do what I like I'mma eat what I like I'mma kiss who I like  
It's my birthday  
I'mma do what I like I'mma wear what I like I'mma party tonight  
God d**n it's my birthday everybody love me  
Yeah yeah yeah look at me give me money  
D**n it's my birthday everybody love me  
And I ain't thinking 'bout you  
It's my birthday my birthday  
And I ain't thinking 'bout you

And I ain't thinking 'bout you

And I ain't thinking 'bout you  
It's my birthday my birthday
