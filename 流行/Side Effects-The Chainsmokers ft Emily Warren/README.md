**Side Effects双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Side Effects_ 是The Chainsmokers联手女声Emily
Warren的新单。此曲没有让大家失望！富有磁性的女声独具风格，虽然不是我们熟悉的Future Bass ，但是燃爆的节奏让人眼前一亮，是我们痴迷的The
Chainsmokers无疑了！

烟鬼组合（The Chainsmokers），美国电子音乐组合，由DJ兼歌手安德鲁•塔格特（Andrew Taggart） 以及亚历克斯•鲍尔（Alex
Pall）组成。在创作和制作两方面都做得十分精致，作为一个EDM组合，他们的强项其实并不是对EDM曲风的革命性开拓和创造。他们更像是一个流行小清新的EDM组合，注重的是作品的旋律性，音色的入耳度，整个氛围的舒适与体验，以及最重要的流行性。

### Side Effects歌词：

It's 4AM I don't know where to go  
Everywhere is closed I should just go home yeah  
My feet are taking me to your front door  
I know I shouldn't though heaven only knows that  
Ooh the side effect to my loneliness is you  
Ooh you're all that I want  
No good at giving you up  
C'mon and gimme some love tonight  
Ooh you're all that I want  
No good at giving you up  
C'mon and gimme some love tonight  
This happens every time I try to mix  
Decision making with one too many drinks but  
Ooh if late night friends have consequences cool yeah  
Ooh you're all that I want  
No good at giving you up  
C'mon and gimme some love tonight  
Ooh you're all that I want  
No good at giving you up  
C'mon and gimme some love tonight  
Ooh I think about it all the time  
Make it up in my mind I'm telling you yeah  
Ooh you're all that I want  
No good at giving you up  
C'mon and gimme some love tonight  
Time should've taught me the lesson  
When looking for a sign but instead I got a message  
I take off my pride every time we undressing  
Draw the line I'm out of line yeah  
Time should've taught me the lesson  
When looking for a sign but instead I got a message  
I take off my pride every time we undressing  
Draw the line I'm out of line  
Ooh you're all that I want  
No good at giving you up  
C'mon and gimme some love tonight yeah  
Ooh you're all that I want  
No good at giving you up  
C'mon and gimme some love tonight yeah  
I I think about it all the time  
Make it up in my mind I'm telling you yeah  
Ooh you're all that I want  
No good at giving you up  
C'mon and gimme some love tonight  
Time should've taught me the lesson  
When looking for a sign but instead I got a message  
I take off my pride every time we undressing  
Draw the line I'm out of line yeah  
Time should've taught me the lesson  
When looking for a sign but instead I got a message  
I take off my pride every time we undressing  
Draw the line I'm out of line yeah
