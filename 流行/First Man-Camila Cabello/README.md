### First Man歌词：

Yes I'm gonna stay with him tonight  
I'll see you in the morning  
No of course he won't drink and drive  
Can you say "bye" to mom for me  
Oh you'll like him he's really kind  
And he's funny like you sometimes  
And I found someone I really like  
Maybe for the first time  
No I don't need a jacket  
It's not that cold tonight  
And you worry I get it  
But he's waiting outside  
I swear on my heart that he's a good man  
I know you'll stay up late just waiting for me  
You held me so tight now someone else can  
But you were the first man that really loved me  
Now you're driving to the airport  
Not just me you pick up anymore  
I've got eight days off coming up  
And I can only come home for four  
Yeah I just met his family  
They're just like you and mom  
He makes me really happy  
I think he might be the one oh  
I swear on my heart that he's a good man  
I promise he loves me he'd never hurt me  
You held me so tight now someone else can  
But you were the first man that really loved me  
Now you're on the driveway faking a smile  
You wish you could tell him he doesn't deserve me  
So I had to stop the car and turn around  
To tell you you were the first man that really loved me  
And before they open up the doors  
I say "I've never seen you cry before"  
You say "You've never looked so beautiful  
You know you'll always be my little girl"  
You're looking at me while walking down the aisle  
With tears in your eyes maybe he deserves me  
You don't even know how much it means to me now  
That you were the first man that really loved me oh  
Really loved me  
Oh you really love me
