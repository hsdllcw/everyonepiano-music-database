**Perfect双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Perfect_ 是加拿大摇滚乐队Hedley的歌曲，收录在其录音室专辑The Show Must Go中。原先的Hedley乐队由Jacob
Hoggard, Kevin Giesbrecht, Kevin Heeres, Ryan Federau和Brandon
Mkay.组成。原先的乐队有许多作品。例如
Gunnin'和Sugarfree（均收录在现Hedley乐队的同名专辑Hedley中）。关于主唱参加加拿大偶像比赛，是因为原乐队的队员与主唱Jacob
Hoggard打赌150$jacob不会参加加拿大偶像的试镜。最终Jacob成功晋级前三，因为选票落后而最终名列加拿大偶像第二季第三名。

### Perfect歌词：

Falling a thousand feet per second,  
you still take me by surprise.  
I just know we can't be over,  
I can see it in your eyes.  
Making every kind of silence,  
takes a lot to realize  
Its worse to finish then  
to start all over and never let it lie.  
And as long as I can feel you holding on.  
I won't fall, even if you said I was wrong.  
I'm not perfect but I keep trying  
cause that's what I said I would do from the start.  
I'm not alive if I'm lonely, so please don't leave.  
Was it something I said or just my personality?  
Making every kind of silence,  
It takes a lot to realize  
Its worse to finish then  
to start all over and never let it lie.  
And as long as I can feel you holding on.  
I won't fall, even if you said I was wrong.  
I know that I'm not perfect but I keep trying  
cause that's what I said I would do from the start.  
I'm not alive if I'm lonely, so please don't leave.  
Was it something I said or just my personality?  
When you're caught in a lie, and you've got nothing to hide,  
When you've got nowhere to run, and you've got nothing inside.  
It tears right through me, you thought that you knew me,  
you thought that you knew..  
I'm not perfect but I keep trying  
cause that's what I said I would do from the start.  
I'm not alive if I'm lonely, so please don't leave.  
Was it something I said or just my personality?  
I'm not perfect but I keep trying  
cause that's what I said I would do from the start.  
I'm not alive if I'm lonely, so please don't leave.  
Was it something I said or just my, just myself?  
Just myself? Myself? Just myself?  
I'm not perfect, but I keep trying.
