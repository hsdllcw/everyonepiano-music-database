### Dance the Night歌词：

Baby you can  
Find me under the lights  
Diamonds under my eyes  
Turn the rhythm up  
Don't you wanna just  
Come along for the ride  
Oh my outfit so tight  
You can see my heart beat tonight  
I can take the heat  
Baby best believe  
That's the moment I shine  
Cuz every romance  
Shakes and it bends  
Don't give a damn  
When the nights here  
I don't do tears  
Baby no chance  
I could dance I could dance I could dance  
Watch me dance  
Dance the night away  
My heart could be burning but you won't see it on my face  
Watch me dance  
Dance the night away  
I'll still keep the party running not one hair out of place  
Lately I've been  
Moving close to the edge  
Still be looking my best  
I stay on the beat  
You can count on me  
I ain't missing no steps  
Cuz every romance  
Shakes and it bends  
Don't give a damn  
When the nights here  
I don't do tears  
Baby no chance  
I could dance I could dance I could dance  
Watch me dance  
Dance the night away  
My heart could be burning but you won't see it on my face  
Watch me dance  
Dance the night away  
I'll still keep the party running not one hair out of place  
When my heart breaks  
You'll never see it never see it  
When my world shakes  
I feel alive I feel alive  
I don't play safe  
Don't you know about me  
I could dance I could dance I could dance  
Even when the tears are flowing  
They're diamonds on my face  
I'll still keep the party going not one hair out of place  
Even when the tears are flowing  
They're diamonds on my face  
I'll still keep the party going not one hair out of place  
Watch me dance  
Dance the night away  
My heart could be burning but you won't see it on my face  
Watch me dance  
Dance the night away  
I'll still keep the party running not one hair out of place  
When my heart breaks  
You'll never see it never see it  
When my world shakes  
I feel alive I feel alive  
I don't play safe  
Don't you know about me  
I could dance I could dance I could dance  
Dance the night
