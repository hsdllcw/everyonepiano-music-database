### Dancing with Tears in My Eyes歌词：

Here we go  
Welcome to my funeral  
Without you  
I don't even have a pulse  
All alone it's dark and cold  
With every move I die

Here I go this is my confessional  
A lost cause nobody can save my soul  
I am so delusional  
With every move I die

I have destroyed our love its gone  
Payback is sick its all my fault

I'm dancing with tears in my eyes  
Just fighting to get through the night  
I'm losing it (losing it) [x3]  
With every move I die  
I'm faded I'm broken inside  
I've wasted the love of my life  
I'm Losing it (losing it) [x3]  
With every move I die

When did I become such a hypocrite  
Double life, lies that you caught me in  
Trust me I'm paying for it  
With every move I die  
On the floor I'm just a zombie  
Who I am is not who I wanna be  
I'm such a tragedy  
With every move I die

I have destroyed our love its gone  
Payback is sick its all my fault

I'm dancing with tears in my eyes  
Just fighting to get through the night  
I'm losing it (losing it) [x3]  
With every move I die  
I'm faded I'm broken inside  
I've wasted the love of my life  
I'm Losing it (losing it) [x3]  
With every move I die

This is it  
And now you're really gone  
this time  
Never once thought  
I'd be in pieces left behind

Im dancing with tears in my eyes  
Just fighting to get through the night  
I'm losing it (losing it) [x3]  
With every move I die  
I'm faded I'm broken inside  
I've wasted the love of my life  
I'm Losing it (losing it) [x3]  
With every move I die
