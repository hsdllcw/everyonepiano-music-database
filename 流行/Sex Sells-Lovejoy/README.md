### Sex Sells歌词：

You think he'd realize  
But he's infatuated with ideas  
Of possessions and far-flung social policy  
His daddy works on the Council  
His missus loves the silver spoon  
Swore she'd never kiss a Tory  
But this boy was too good to lose  
And I'll listen carefully  
With ears pressed to the floor  
As you make your way downstairs  
You haven't got far to fall  
Now it's red, now it's dead  
Now it's everything she needed  
Now it's four open doors  
Pillows pressed under your knees  
Now it's a sad, sappy sucker  
To ensure her the ending  
I've been scared of sleeping with the lights on  
Know she's not there, I know she's going to his flat  
A Capricorn, oh, fuck that  
They say sex sells, I know that  
I've been scared of sleeping with the lights on  
Know she's not there, I know she's going to his flat  
A Capricorn, oh, fuck that  
They say sex sells, I know that  
You could buy my silence  
If you've got none to lose  
If he's still infatuated with the truth  
So will you do what's easy?  
Or will you do what's right?  
Please just could you let me know  
Where will you sleep tonight?  
Where you gonna sleep tonight?  
Where will you sleep tonight?  
Where you gonna sleep tonight?  
Where will you sleep tonight?  
Where will you sleep at night?  
How do you sleep at night?  
Cultured man  
Venetian suntan  
Red wine and club bands  
Viagra pills on the nightstand  
How's it feel?  
How's it feel to be so loved?  
How's it feel to be so loved, yet so alone?  
I've been scared of sleeping with the lights on  
Know she's not there, I know she's going to his flat  
A Capricorn, oh, fuck that  
They say sex sells, I know that  
I've been scared of sleeping with the lights off  
Know she's not there, I know she's going to his flat  
A Capricorn, oh, fuck that  
They say sex sells, I know that  
I've been scared of sleeping with the lights off  
Know she's not there, I know she's going to his flat  
A Capricorn, oh, fuck that  
They say sex sells, I know that  
Sex sells, I know that  
Sex sells, I know that  
Do you sleep at night?
