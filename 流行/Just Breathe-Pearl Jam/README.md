《 **Just Breathe** 》是美国另类流行/摇滚乐队Pearl Jam的歌曲。收录于专辑《Backspacer》中。

  

Pearl Jam的前身是九十年代初著名Grunge乐队Mother Love Bone，该乐队主唱Andrew
Wood服用毒品过量身亡后，吉他手Stone Gossard和贝司手Jeff Ament和新加入的吉他手Mike McCready、鼓手Dave
Krusen、主唱Eddie Vedder一起组建了新乐队Pearl
Jam。1991年，乐队录制了第一张专辑《Ten》，它在开始并未取得很好的成绩，但在涅槃的经典专辑《Nevermind》的带动下，另类摇滚开始主流化。1992年，《Ten》最终超越了《Nevermind》的销量，成为九十年代极少的几张多白金处女作之一。Pearl
Jam华丽高雅的Grunge音乐风格在当时自成一派，更加讲求整体音乐素养和对后朋克博大精深的摇滚流派的参悟。

Just Breathe歌词：

  

Yes, I understand that every life must end, uh-huh  
As we sit alone, I know someday we must go, uh-huh  
Oh I'm a lucky man, to count on both hands the ones I love  
Some folks just have one, yeah, others, they've got none

Stay with me...  
Let's just breathe...

Practiced all my sins, never gonna let me win, uh-huh  
Under everything, just another human being, uh-huh  
I don't wanna hurt, there's so much in this world to make me bleed

Stay with me  
You're all I see...

Did I say that I need you?  
Did I say that I want you?  
Oh, if I didn't I'm a fool you see  
No one knows this more than me

As I come clean...  
I wonder everyday, as I look upon your face, uh-huh  
Everything you gave  
And nothing you would save, oh no

Nothing you would take  
Everything you gave...

Did I say that I need you?  
Oh, did I say that I want you?  
Oh, if I didn't I'm a fool you see  
No one knows this more than me  
And I come clean, ah...

Nothing you would take  
Everything you gave  
Hold me til I die  
Meet you on the other side...
