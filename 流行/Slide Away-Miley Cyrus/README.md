### Slide Away歌词：

Wooh wooh wooh  
Wooh wooh wooh  
Once upon a time it was paradise  
One upon a time I was paralyzed  
Think I'm gonna miss these harbor lights  
But it's time to let it go  
Once upon a time it was made for us  
Woke up one day it had turned to dust  
Baby we were found but now we're lost  
So it's time to let it go  
I want my house in the hills  
Don't want the whiskey and pills  
I don't give up easily  
But I don't think I'm down  
So won't you slide away  
Back to the ocean I'll go back to the city lights  
So won't you slide away  
Back to the ocean nahh nah nah you'll slide away  
So won't you slide away  
Back to the ocean I'll go back to the city lights  
So won't you slide away  
Back to the ocean nahh nah nah you'll slide away  
Once upon a time it was paradise  
One upon a time I was paralyzed  
Think I'm gonna miss these harbor lights  
But it's time to let it go  
Once upon a time it was made for us  
Woke up one day it had turned to dust  
Baby we were found but now we're lost  
So it's time to let it go  
Move on we're not seventeen  
I'm not who I used to be  
You say that everything's changed  
You're right we're grown now  
So won't you slide away  
Back to the ocean I'll go back to the city lights  
So won't you slide away  
Back to the ocean nahh nah nah you'll slide away  
So won't you slide away  
Back to the ocean I'll go back to the city lights  
So won't you slide away  
Back to the ocean nahh nah nah you'll slide away  
Move on we're not seventeen  
I'm not who I used to be  
You say that everything's changed  
You're right we're grown now
