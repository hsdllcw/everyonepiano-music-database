### Venus Fly Trap歌词：

Whatever you give life you will get back  
Why be a wallflower when you can be a Venus fly trap  
I never quite fit in  
To that Hollywood thing  
I didn't play that game  
For the money or the fame  
Oh  
I did it my way baby  
Nothing in this world could change me  
Don't underestimate me  
'Cause one day you're gonna see you're in a losing battle  
Babe you'll never stop me being me  
I got the beauty got the brains  
Got the power hold the reins  
I should be motherf**king crazy  
Nothing in this world could change me  
I sacrificed it all for a life to call mine  
All the love and security  
To be myself oh I  
I know that money ain't important  
Ah  
And it don't mean you're the best  
Oh  
But I earned it all myself  
And I'm a millionairess  
I did it my way baby  
Nothing in this world could change me  
Don't underestimate me  
'Cause one day you're gonna see you're in a losing battle  
Babe you'll never stop me being me  
I got the beauty got the brains  
Got the power hold the reins  
I should be motherf**king crazy  
Nothing in this world could change me  
They'll shame you blame you  
Pretend to even hate you  
Take away your rights  
Pacify you with their lies  
Whatever you give life  
You are gonna get back  
Why be a wallflower  
You can be a Venus fly trap  
Don't underestimate me  
'Cause one day you're gonna see you're in a losing battle  
Babe you'll never stop me being me  
'Cause whatever you give life  
You're gonna get back  
Why be a wallflower  
When you can be a Venus fly trap  
Nothing in this world oh  
Nothing in this world could change me  
Me
