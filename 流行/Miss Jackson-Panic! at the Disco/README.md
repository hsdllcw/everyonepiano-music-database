Miss Jackson歌词：

  

Climbing out the back door, didn't leave a mark  
No one knows it's you Miss Jackson  
Found another victim  
But no one's gonna find Miss Jackson, Jackson, Jackson

You put a sour little flavor in my mouth now  
You move in circles hoping no one's gonna find out  
But we're so lucky,  
Kiss the ring and let 'em bow down  
Looking for the time of your life (ain't always gonna find out)

A pretty picture but the scenery is so loud,  
A face like heaven catching lighting in your nightgown,  
But back away from the water, babe, you might drown-  
The party isn't over tonight (lighting in your nightgown)

He-eyy  
Where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?  
He-eyy  
Out the back door  
Goddamn  
But I love her anyway  
I love her anyway  
I love her anyway  
Out the back door  
Goddamn  
But I love her anyway

Miss Jackson  
Miss Jackson  
Miss Jackson  
Are you nasty?

Miss Jackson  
Miss Jackson  
Miss Jackson  
Are you nasty?

Miss Jackson  
Miss Jackson  
Miss Jackson  
Are you nasty?  
Are you nasty?  
I love her anyway

Ohhhh  
Where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?  
Ohhhh  
Out the back door  
Goddamn  
But I love her anyway

Way down 'til the fire finally dies out  
You've got 'em wrapped around your finger  
Watch 'em fall down  
There's something beautiful and tragic in the fall out  
Let me say it one more time  
(Tragic in the fall out)

He-eyy  
Where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?  
He-eyy  
Out the back door, Goddamn  
But I love her anyway

I love her anyway  
I love her anyway  
Out the back door  
Goddamn  
But I love her anyway

Miss Jackson  
Miss Jackson  
Miss Jackson  
Are you nasty?

Miss Jackson  
Miss Jackson  
Miss Jackson  
Are you nasty?

Miss Jackson  
Miss Jackson  
Miss Jackson  
Are you nasty?  
Are you nasty?  
I love her anyway

Ohhhh  
Where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?  
Ohhhh  
Out the back door  
Goddamn  
But I love her any...

Climbing out the back door, didn't leave a mark  
No one knows it's you Miss Jackson  
Found another victim  
But no one's gonna find Miss Jackson, Jackson, Jackson

I love her anyway

Miss Jackson  
Miss Jackson  
Miss Jackson  
Are you nasty?

Miss Jackson  
Miss Jackson  
Miss Jackson  
Are you nasty?

Miss Jackson  
Miss Jackson  
Miss Jackson  
Are you nasty?  
Are you nasty?  
I love her anyway

Ohhhh  
When will you be waking up tomorrow morning?  
Ohhhh  
Out the back door  
Goddamn  
But I love her anyway
