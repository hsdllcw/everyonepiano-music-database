_Little Bitty_ 是美国歌手Alan Jackson演唱的歌曲。Alan Jackson是继Garth
Brooks之后90年代最著名的乡村音乐男歌手，作为80年代的新传统主义运动的继承者，虽然他立足于酒馆音乐，但在当代主流音乐中同样如鱼得水。他擅长自主创作并演唱歌曲，唱法朴实自然，音乐富有深意，抛开音乐不谈，他谦逊、生气勃勃和平易近人的性格，同样备受歌迷喜爱，这也是他前12年的生涯中便拥有着20多首冠军单曲和更多前十名单曲的重要原因。

### Little Bitty歌词：

Have a little love on a little honeymoon  
You got a little dish and you got a little spoon  
A little bitty house and a little bitty yard  
A little bitty dog and a little bitty car  
Well it's alright to be little bitty  
A little hometown or a big old city  
Might as well share might as well smile  
Life goes on for a little bitty while  
A little bitty baby in a little bitty gown  
It'll grow up in a little bitty town  
A big yellow bus and little bitty books  
It all started with a little bitty look  
Well it's alright to be little bitty  
A little hometown or a big old city  
Might as well share might as well smile  
Life goes on for a little bitty while  
You know you got a job and a little bitty check  
A six pack of beer and television set  
Little bitty world goes around and around  
Little bit of silence and a little bit of sound  
A good ole boy and a pretty little girl  
Start all over in a little bitty world  
Little bitty plan and a little bitty dream  
It's all part of a little bitty scheme  
It's alright to be little bitty  
A little hometown or a big old city  
Might as well share might as well smile  
Life goes on for a little bitty while  
It's alright to be little bitty  
A little hometown or a big old city  
Might as well share might as well smile  
Life goes on for a little bitty while
