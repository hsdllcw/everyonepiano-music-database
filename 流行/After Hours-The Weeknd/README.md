**After Hours** 出自加拿大男歌手The Weeknd的第四张录音室专辑After
Hours。被福布斯评选为2020年最受期待的R&B专辑之一。

而威肯之所以将这张专辑命名为“ _After Hours_
”，其主要是因为这些内容都是他在深夜的情绪、想法和感觉：包含了威肯在夜店之后，在斗争之后，在漫长的一天之后的想法等
。他在经历了这些情绪之后，用专辑音乐记录自己所经历过的悲伤、痛苦、孤独等种种“至暗时刻”，该专辑的核心概念既“在夜晚的后几个小时，可以找到爱、恐惧、朋友、敌人、暴力、舞蹈、性、恶魔、天使、孤独与热闹”。此外，威肯在专辑中描绘了一个非常投入的愿景和角色，并探索了粉丝从未见过的、自己的另一面。

### After Hours歌词：

Thought I almost died in my dream again  
Baby almost died  
Fightin' for my life I couldn't breathe again  
I'm fallin' in too deep  
Oh oh  
Without you I can't sleep  
Fallin' in  
'Cause my heart belongs to you  
I'll risk it all for you  
I want you next to me  
This time I'll never leave  
I wanna share babies  
Protection we won't need  
Your body next to me  
Is just a memory  
I'm fallin' in too deep oh  
Without you I can't sleep  
Insomnia relieve oh  
Talk to me without you I can't breathe  
My darkest hours  
Girl I felt so alone inside of this crowded room  
Different girls on the floor distractin' my thoughts of you  
I turned into the man I used to be to be  
Put myself to sleep  
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams  
Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me  
I just wanted to call you and say and say  
Oh baby  
Where are you now when I need you most  
I'd give it all just to hold you close  
Sorry that I broke your heart your heart  
Never comin' down uh  
I was running away from facin' reality uh  
Wastin' all of my time out living my fantasies  
Spendin' money to compensate compensate  
'Cause I want you baby uh  
I be livin' in heaven when I'm inside of you  
It was simply a blessing wakin' beside you  
I'll never let you down again again  
Oh baby  
Where are you now when I need you most  
I'd give it all just to hold you close  
Sorry that I broke your heart your heart  
I said baby  
I'll treat you better than I did before  
I'll hold you down and not let you go  
This time I won't break your heart your heart yeah  
I know it's all my fault  
Made you put down your guard  
I know I made you fall  
Then said you were wrong for me  
I lied to you I lied to you I lied to you  
To you  
Can't hide the truth I'd stay with her in spite of you  
You did some things that you regret still ride for you  
'Cause this house is not a home  
Without my baby  
Where are you now when I need you most  
I gave it all just to hold you close  
Sorry that I broke your heart your heart  
And I said baby  
I'll treat you better than I did before  
I'll hold you down and not let you go  
This time I won't break your heart your heart no
