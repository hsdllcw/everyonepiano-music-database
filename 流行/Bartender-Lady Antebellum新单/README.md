### Bartender-Lady Antebellum歌词：

8 o'clock on Friday night I'm still at home

All my girls just keep on blowing up my phone

Saying come on, it ain't worth the pain

Do what you gotta do to forget his name

Now there's only one thing left for me to do

Slip on my favorite dress and sky high leather boots

Check the mirror one last time

Kiss the past goodbye

What I'm really needing now

Is a double shot of Crown

Chase that disco ball around

‘Til I don't remember

Go until they cut me off

Wanna get a little lost

In the noise, in the lights

Hey bartender pour ‘em hot tonight

‘Til the party and music and the truth collide

Bring it ‘til his memory fades away

Hey bartender

Tonight I'll let a stranger pull me on the floor

Spin me round and let 'em invite a couple more

But before it goes too far

I'll let me down easy

'Cause tonight it's all about

Dancing with my girls to the DJ

Put that song on replay

What I'm really needing now

Is a double shot of Crown

Chase that disco ball around

'Til I don't remember

Go until they cut me off

Wanna get a little lost

In the noise, in the lights

Hey bartender pour 'em hot tonight

'Til the party and music and the truth collide

Bring it 'til his memory fades away

Hey bartender

I'm feeling that close

I'm ready to rock

Ain't no way I'm gonna tell you to stop

So pour that thing up to the top

I'm coming in hot

Hey bartender

What I'm really needing now

Is a double shot of Crown

Chase that disco ball around

'Til I don't remember

Go until they cut me off

Wanna get a little lost

In the noise, in the lights

Hey bartender pour 'em hot tonight

'Til the party and music and the truth collide

Bring it 'til his memory fades away

Hey bartender

Hey bartender
