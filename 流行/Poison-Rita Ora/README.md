### Poison歌词：

I could have beer for breakfast  
My sanity for lunch  
Trying to get over how bad I want you so much  
Innocence for dinner  
Pour something in my cup  
Anything and everything just to fill me up

But nothing ever gets me high like this  
I pick my poison and it's you  
Nothing could kill me like you do  
You're going straight to my head  
And I'm heading straight for the edge  
I pick my poison and it's you  
I pick my poison and it's you

I can feel you whisper  
And laying on the floor  
And I try to stop but I keep on coming back for more  
I'm a lightweight, and I know it  
Cause after the first time  
I was falling  
Falling now

But nothing ever gets me high like this  
I pick my poison and it's you  
Nothing could kill me like you do  
You're going straight to my head  
And I'm heading straight for the edge  
I pick my poison and it's you  
I pick my poison and it's you

This bittersweet ecstasy that you got me in  
Falling deep I can't sleep tonight  
And you make me feel like I'm out of my mind  
But it's alright, it's alright, it's alright  
This bittersweet ecstasy that you got me in  
Falling deep I can't sleep tonight  
And you make me feel like I'm out of my mind  
Ohh, but it's alright, it's alright, it's alright

Cause nothing ever gets me high like this  
I pick my poison and it's you  
Nothing could kill me like you do  
You're going straight to my head  
And I'm heading straight for the edge  
(I'm heading straight for the edge)  
I pick my poison and it's you  
(Ohh it's you)  
I pick my poison and it's you  
And it's you  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
I pick my poison and it's you
