### Simmer歌词：

Rage is a quiet thing  
Ooh you think that you've tamed it  
But it's just lying in wait  
Rage is it in our veins  
Feel it in my face when  
When I least expect it  
Give in  
Control  
There's so many ways to give in  
Eyes closed  
Another way to make it to ten  
Oh how to draw the line between wrath and mercy  
Gotta simmer simmer simmer simmer simmer down  
Control  
There's so many ways to give in  
Eyes closed  
Another way to make it to ten  
Oh how to draw the line between wrath and mercy  
Gotta simmer simmer simmer simmer simmer down  
If I had seen my reflection  
As something more precious  
He would've never  
Mmm and if my child needed protection  
From a f**ker like that man  
I'd sooner gut him  
'Cause nothing cuts like a mother  
Give in  
Control  
There's so many ways to give in  
Eyes closed  
Another way to make it to ten  
Oh how to draw the line between wrath and mercy  
Simmer simmer simmer simmer simmer down  
Control  
There's so many ways to give in  
Eyes closed  
Another way to make it to ten  
Oh how to draw the line between wrath and mercy  
Simmer simmer simmer simmer simmer simmer  
Gotta simmer simmer simmer simmer simmer down  
Wrap yourself in petals  
Yourself  
Wrap yourself in petals  
Control yourself  
Wrap yourself in petals for armor  
Control control  
Simmer simmer simmer simmer simmer simmer  
Petals  
For armor  
Simmer simmer simmer simmer simmer simmer  
Simmer simmer simmer  
Give in  
Control  
There's so many ways to give in  
Eyes closed  
Another way to make it to ten  
Oh how to draw the line between wrath and mercy  
Gotta simmer simmer simmer simmer simmer down  
Control  
There's so many ways to give in  
Eyes closed  
Another way to make it to ten  
Oh how to draw the line between wrath and mercy  
Gotta simmer simmer simmer
