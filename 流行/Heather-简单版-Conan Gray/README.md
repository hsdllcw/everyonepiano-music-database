《 **Heather** 》是美国流行男歌手、词曲创作者柯南•格雷（Conan
Gray）演唱的歌曲。此曲在抖音平台上掀起狂潮，歌曲不仅攻进美国Billboard公告牌热门单曲榜，在全球的播放量也突破三亿大关，让其代表作再加一！

《 _Heather_ 》讲述柯南•格雷爱慕的对象，其实喜欢的是一位名叫Heather的完美女孩，也因此柯南•格雷对Heather这位情敌恨之入骨。

柯南•格雷表示《Heather》总是让他想哭，他认为这首歌诚实地描述了他自己的感情状态。

“我想人人生命中都有一位Heather，要承认自己讨厌她其实蛮丢脸的，但这就是事实。我蛮担心大家对这首歌的看法，但我鲜少听到他人坦承过类似这样的感受。我还是得向Heather说声抱歉，你其实是一个很好的人！”

《Heather》这首歌曲也让柯南•格雷获得乐坛大前辈艾尔顿•约翰（Elton John）的盛赞，称他是“排行榜上唯一靠自己的力量写出好歌的歌手”。

而歌曲中赤裸未添加任何滤镜的苦涩单恋心情，也让许多年轻世代从中找到共鸣，“Heather”一字更成为美国青少年间，用来形容漂亮可人的女生的代名词！

### Heather歌词：

I still remember the third of December me in your sweater  
You said it looked better on me than it did you  
Only if you knew how much I liked you  
But I watch your eyes as she  
Walks by  
What a sight for sore eyes brighter than the blue sky  
She's got you mesmerized while I die  
Why would you ever kiss me  
I'm not even half as pretty  
You gave her your sweater it's just polyester  
But you like her better  
Wish I were Heather  
Watch as she stands with her holding your hand  
Put your arm 'round her shoulder now I'm getting colder  
But how could I hate her she's such an angel  
But then again kinda wish she were dead as she  
Walks by what a sight for sore eyes  
Brighter than the blue sky  
She's got you mesmerized while I die  
Why would you ever kiss me  
I'm not even half as pretty  
You gave her your sweater it's just polyester  
But you like her better  
I wish I were Heather  
Oh  
Wish I were Heather  
Oh oh  
Wish I were Heather  
Why would you ever kiss me  
I'm not even half as pretty  
You gave her your sweater it's just polyester  
But you like her better  
Wish I were
