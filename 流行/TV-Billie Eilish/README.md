《 **TV** 》是美国创作歌手Billie Eilish演唱的一首歌曲，于2022年7月21日发布。且此曲收录在EP专辑《Guitar Songs》中。

返璞归真，大道化简，这张仅有两支单曲的EP是Billie
Eilish对前一段刚刚结束的恋情、周遭环境骤然变化、舆论媒体的热点话题温和而简练的总结，这位曾以怪奇、厌世出圈的创作歌手再度向听众展露了她作为自然人脆弱、面对动荡不安的社会忧虑烦扰的一面，寄情于《
_TV_
》被她描述成逃避现实的方式之一，但这样真实而恳切的表达，用单一的乐器构成回归到最为简单质朴的表现形式，结尾巡演与粉丝合唱的mashup凝结出庞大温柔的能量，声音的力场投映出的莹莹微光，或许正是她在用自己的力量向这个世界坦然的触达情感。

### TV歌词：

I don't wanna talk right now  
I just wanna watch TV  
I'll stay in the pool and drown  
So I don't have to watch you leave  
I put on Survivor just to watch somebody suffer  
Maybe I should get some sleep  
Sinking in the sofa while they all betray each other  
What's the point of anything  
All of my friends are missing again  
That's what happens when you fall in love  
You don't have the time you leave them all behind  
You tell yourself it's fine you're just in love  
Don't know where you are right now  
Did you see me on TV  
I'll try not to starve myself  
Just because you're mad at me  
And I'll be in denial for at least a little while  
What about the plans we made  
The internet's gone wild watching movie stars on trial  
While they're overturning Roe v. Wade  
Now all of my friends are missing again  
'Cause that's what happens when you fall in love  
You don't have the time you leave them all behind  
And you tell yourself it's fine you're just in love  
And I don't get along with anyone  
Maybe I'm the problem  
Maybe I'm the problem  
Maybe I maybe I maybe I'm the problem  
Maybe I maybe I maybe I'm the problem  
Maybe I maybe I maybe I'm the problem  
Maybe I maybe I maybe I'm the problem  
Maybe I maybe I maybe I'm the problem  
Maybe I maybe I maybe I'm the problem  
Baby I baby I baby I'm the problem  
Baby I baby I baby I'm the problem  
Baby I baby I baby I'm the problem  
Baby I baby I baby I'm the problem  
Baby I baby I baby I'm the problem
