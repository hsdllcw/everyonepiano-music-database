**Bloodstream双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Bloodstream_ 是美国的电子音乐组合The Chainsmokers的歌曲。于2017年4月发行。

The
Chainsmokers在创作和制作两方面都做得十分精致，他们的作品经得住专业测评以及大众考验。他们的风格跟通常EDM乐风略有不同，他们专注的EDM更加清新，重点打磨旋律，集中打造聆听感受舒服的体验，即侧重“入耳度”。专注于音乐独特口味的打造外，组合还偏好发掘“小众”，比如，选择合作歌手都属于“实习生”段位。所以，在他们身上可以看到“庸众”崛起的场面，所谓“庸众”并非贬义，而是指那些暂时没有获得更多关注的实力派。

### Bloodstream歌词：

I've been drunk three times this week  
Spent all my money on a fleeting moment  
I thought I-I-I-I-I-I can shake this off  
Now I-I-I-I-I-I can't make this stop  
Yeah, things were sweet three months ago  
When I was living how I wanna on my own  
And I thought I-I-I-I-I-I don't need that much  
I guess I-I-I-I-I-I was out of touch  
I'm fucked up, I'm faded  
I'm so complicated  
Those things that I said  
They were so overrated  
But I-I-I-I-I-I, yeah, I meant it  
Oh yeah, I-I-I-I-I-I, really fucking meant it  
Yeah, I meant it  
I gave up three times this week  
Went through those feelings  
Like I wasn't worth nothing  
I thought I-I-I-I-I-I can shake this off  
No, I-I-I-I-I-I can't be this soft  
I'm fucked up, I'm faded  
I'm so complicated  
Those things that I said  
They were so overrated  
But I-I-I-I-I-I, yeah, I meant it  
Oh yeah, I-I-I-I-I-I, really fucking meant it  
Yeah, I meant it  
I'm fucked up, I'm faded  
I'm so complicated  
Those things that I said  
They were so overrated  
But I-I-I-I-I, yeah, I meant it  
Oh yeah, I-I-I-I-I, really fucking meant it  
Yeah, I meant it  
Yeah, I meant it
