### The Pretender歌词：

Keep you in the dark  
You know they all pretend  
Keep you in the dark  
And so it all began  
Send in your skeletons  
Sing as their bones go marching in again  
The need you buried deep  
The secrets that you keep are at the ready  
Are you ready  
I'm finished making sense  
Done pleading ignorance  
That whole defense  
Spinning infinity boy  
The wheel is spinning me  
It's never-ending never-ending  
Same old story  
What if I say I'm not like the others  
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays  
You're the pretender  
What if I say that I'll never surrender  
What if I say I'm not like the others  
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays  
You're the pretender  
What if I say that I'll never surrender  
In time or so i'm told  
I'm just another soul for sale oh well  
The page is out of print  
We are not permanent  
We're temporary temporary  
Same old story  
What if I say I'm not like the others  
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays  
You're the pretender  
What if I say that I'll never surrender  
What if I say I'm not like the others  
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays  
You're the pretender  
What if I say that I'll never surrender  
I'm the voice inside your head  
You refuse to hear  
I'm the face that you have to face  
Mirrored in your stare  
I'm what's left I'm what's right  
I'm the enemy  
I'm the hand that will take you down  
Bring you to your knees  
So who are you  
Yeah who are you  
Yeah who are you  
Yeah who are you  
Keep you in the dark  
You know they all pretend  
What if I say I'm not like the others  
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays  
You're the pretender  
What if I say that I'll never surrender  
What if I say I'm not like the others  
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays  
You're the pretender  
What if I say that I'll never surrender  
What if I say I'm not like the others  
（Keep you in the dark）  
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays  
（You know they all pretend）  
You're the pretender  
What if I say that I'll never surrender  
What if I say I'm not like the others  
（Keep you in the dark）  
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays  
（You know they all pretend）  
You're the pretender  
What if I say that I'll never surrender  
So who are you  
Yeah who are you  
Yeah who are you
