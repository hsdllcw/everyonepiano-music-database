### I’m Into You歌词：

[Intro: Jennifer Lopez (Lil Wayne)]  
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh  
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh (uh)  
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh (yes)  
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh  
(Miss Lopez, uh um)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]  
Hi, I'm Tune, the man on the moon  
I live on the beach, get the sand out ya shoes  
And all of that change since I met you  
So we can leave that old shit in the restroom  
Young Money!

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]  
You got me and I could not defend it  
I tried but I had to surrender  
Your style got me under the spell now  
Left me no other choice but to get down

[Hook: Jennifer Lopez (Lil Wayne)]  
It's too late (it's too late), it's too late (it's too late)  
It's too late (uh), it's too late (tell 'em)  
You got it (you got it), you got it (you got it)  
You got it (you got it), you got it (uh)

[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez (Lil Wayne)]  
When I look into your eyes, it's over  
You got me hooked with your love controller (yeah)  
I'm trippin' and I could not get over  
I feel lucky like a four leaf clover

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez (Lil Wayne)]  
I'm into you, I'm into you  
I'm into you, yeaaahh (come on)  
I'm into you (I'm into you), I'm into you (I'm into you)  
I'm into you, yeaaah (uh)

[Jennifer Lopez & (Lil Wayne):]  
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh (ey)  
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh (yeah)  
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh (ey)  
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh

[Verse 3: Jennifer Lopez]  
Listen, now I'm strong baby I bring the fire on  
Sharp shooter, you can call me the Zion  
I'm not the one easy to get to  
But all that changed, baby when I met you

[Hook: Jennifer Lopez (Lil Wayne)]  
It's too late (it's too late), it's too late (it's too late)  
It's too late (it's too late), it's too late (come on)  
You got it (you got it), you got it (you got it)  
You got it (you got it), you got it (yeah)

[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez (Lil Wayne)]  
When I look into your eyes, it's over  
You got me hooked with your love controller  
I'm trippin' and I could not get over  
I feel lucky like a four leaf clover (why?)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez (Lil Wayne)]  
I'm into you (I'm into you), I'm into you (I'm into you)  
I'm into you, yeaaah  
I'm into you (I'm into you), I'm into you (haaaa)  
I'm into you, yeaaah

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]  
Okay now I'm into you, like you never knew  
I'm falling for ya baby, I need a parachute  
Pussy so wet, I need a wet suit  
You're way too fly, I could be your jet fuel  
Now tell me what you like, I like what you tell me  
And if you understand me, then you can overwhelm me  
It's too late, it's too late  
Every finish line is the beginning of a new race, haaa

[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez (Lil Wayne)]  
When I look into your eyes, it's over (yeah)  
You got me hooked with your love controller  
I'm trippin' and I could not get over  
I feel lucky like a four leaf clover (come on)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]  
I'm into you (I'm into you), I'm into you (I'm into you)  
I'm into you, yeaaah (I'm into you babyyy)  
I'm into you (I'm into you), I'm into you (I'm into you)  
I'm into you, yeaaah

[Jennifer Lopez (Lil Wayne):]

Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh (yeah)  
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh (yeah)  
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh (ey)  
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh (yeah)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
