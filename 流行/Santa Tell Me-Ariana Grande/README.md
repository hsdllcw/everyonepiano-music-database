### Santa Tell Me歌词：

Santa, tell me if you're really there  
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here  
Next year  
Santa, tell me if he really cares  
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here  
Next year

Feeling Christmas all around  
And I'm tryna' play it cool  
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room  
"Let It Snow" is blasting out  
But I won't get in the mood  
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know  
It's true love that he thinks of  
So next Christmas  
I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you're really there  
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here  
Next year  
Santa, tell me if he really cares  
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here  
Next year

I've been down this road before  
Fell in love on Christmas night  
But on New Year's Day I woke up and he wasn't by my side  
Now I need someone to hold  
Be my fire in the cold  
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling  
Or if it's true love that he thinks of  
So next Christmas  
I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you're really there  
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here  
Next year  
Santa, tell me if he really cares  
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here  
Next year

Oh, I wanna have him beside me like oh-oh-oh  
On the 25th by the fireplace, oh-oh-oh  
But I don't want a new broken heart  
This year I've got to be smart

Oh, baby  
If ya won't be, if ya won't be here!

Santa, tell me if you're really there  
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here  
Next year  
Santa, tell me if he really cares  
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here  
Next year

Santa, tell me if you're really there  
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here  
Next year  
Santa, tell me if he really cares  
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here  
Next year
