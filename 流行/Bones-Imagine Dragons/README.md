美国摇滚人气天团梦龙lmagine Dragons释出全新单曲《 **Bones** 》，收录于即将与乐迷见面的全新力作《Mercury-Act
2》专辑之中。

畅快的语句，清晰的咬字，给人耳清目明的感觉，同时又有他们自己的态度。专辑的封面映射了整首歌的思想，人们面对的一个个敌人或对手不是别人，而就是自己本身，审视自己的灵魂，解脱自身的宿命，真的是一件很艰难的事情。勇敢的面对自己，不抱有灰色地带的缓冲地带去逃避现实，行走在刀刃上，即使是指责的话语，非黑即白也好，亦能把自己打碎重塑，这就是真正的他们，恣意的人生无需多言。

### Bones歌词：

Gimme gimme gimme some time to think  
I'm in the bathroom looking at me  
Face in the mirror is all I need  
Wait until the reaper takes my life  
Never gonna get me out alive  
I will live a thousand million lives  
My patience is waning  
Is this entertaining  
My patience is waning  
Is this entertaining  
I got this feeling yeah you know  
Where I'm losing all control  
Cause there's magic in my bones  
I got this feeling in my soul  
Go ahead and throw your stones  
Cause there's magic in my bones  
Playing with a stick of dynamite  
There was never grey in black and white  
There was never wrong till there was right  
Feeling like a boulder hurdling  
Seeing all the vultures circling  
Burning in the flames I'm working in  
Turning in a bed that's darkening  
My patience is waning  
Is this entertaining  
My patience is waning  
Is this entertaining  
I got this feeling yeah you know  
Where I'm losing all control  
Cause there's magic in my bones  
I got this feeling in my soul  
Go ahead and throw your stones  
Cause there's magic in my bones  
Cause there's magic in my bones  
Look in the mirror of my mind  
Turning the pages of my life  
Walking the path so many paced a million times  
Drown out the voices in the air  
Leaving the ones that never cared  
Picking the pieces up and building to the sky  
My patience is waning  
Is this entertaining  
My patience is waning  
Is this entertaining  
I got this feeling yeah you know  
Where I'm losing all control  
Cause there's magic in my bones  
I got this feeling in my soul  
Go ahead and throw your stones  
Cause there's magic in my bones  
There goes my mind don't mind  
There goes my mind  
There goes my mind don't mind  
There goes my mind  
Cause there's magic in my bones
