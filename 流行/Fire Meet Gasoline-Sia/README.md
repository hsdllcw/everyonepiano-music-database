**Fire Meet Gasoline**
是澳大利亚流行女歌手、词曲人Sia所演唱的一首歌曲。其慵懒沙哑的声线，独特的咬字，以及非凡的唱功给人们留下了深刻的印象。

另外， _Fire Meet Gasoline_ 此曲收录在其个人第六张专辑《1000 Forms of
Fear》中。本专辑的视觉设计也大胆地围绕了Sia本人招牌的铂色短发展开，甚至发起了一个名为“Siaselfie”的P图活动，引起了全球各地粉丝纷纷“自黑”。

### Fire Meet Gasoline歌词：

It's dangerous to fall in love  
But I want to burn with you tonight  
Hurt me  
There's two of us  
Bristling with desire  
The pleasure's pain and fire  
Burn me

So come on  
I'll take you on, take you on  
I ache for love, ache for us  
Why don't you come  
Don't you come a little closer  
So come on now  
Strike the match, strike the match now  
We're a perfect match, perfect somehow  
We were meant for one another  
Come a little closer

[Chorus:]  
Flame you came to me  
Fire meet gasoline  
Fire meet gasoline  
I'm burning alive  
I can barely breathe  
When you're here loving me  
Fire meet gasoline  
Fire meet gasoline  
I got all I need  
When you came after me  
Fire meet gasoline  
I'm burning alive  
And I can barely breathe  
When you're here loving me  
Fire meet gasoline  
Burn with me tonight

And we will fly  
Like smoke darknin' the skies  
I'm Eve, I want to try  
Take a bite

So come on now  
Strike the match, strike the match now  
We're a perfect match, perfect somehow  
We were meant for one another  
Come a little closer

[Chorus:]  
Flame you came to me  
Fire meet gasoline  
Fire meet gasoline  
I'm burning alive  
I can barely breathe  
When you're here loving me  
Fire meet gasoline  
Fire meet gasoline  
I got all I need  
When you came after me  
Fire meet gasoline  
I'm burning alive  
And I can barely breathe  
When you're here loving me  
Fire meet gasoline  
Burn with me tonight

[Bridge:]  
But it's a bad debt  
Certain death  
But I want what I want  
And I gotta get it  
When the fire dies  
Darkened skies  
Hot ash, dead match  
Only smoke is left  
It's a bad debt  
Certain death  
But I want what I want  
And I got to get it  
When the fire dies  
Dark in the skies  
Hot as a match  
Only smoke is left

[Chorus:]  
Flame you came to me  
Fire meet gasoline  
Fire meet gasoline  
I'm burning alive  
I can barely breathe  
When you're here loving me  
Fire meet gasoline  
Fire meet gasoline  
I got all I need  
When you came after me  
Fire meet gasoline  
I'm burning alive  
And I can barely breathe  
When you're here loving me  
Fire meet gasoline  
Burn with me tonight

Burn with me tonight  
Burn with me tonight  
Burn with me tonight  
Eh eh
