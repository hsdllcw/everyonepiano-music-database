### How to Save a Life歌词：

Step one you say we need to talk  
第一步，你说我们该谈谈了  
He walks you say sit down it's just a talk  
他走过来，你说坐，只是谈谈  
He smiles politely back at you  
他朝你礼貌地微笑  
You stare politely right on through  
你也礼貌地看着他  
Some sort of window to your right  
你的右边是个窗户  
As he goes left and you stay right  
当他走向左边时，你还是呆在右边  
Between the lines of fear and blame  
就在惧怕与责备的界限上  
And you begin to wonder why you came  
你开始纳闷你干吗要来  
Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend  
我做错什么了吗？ 就这样少了一个朋友  
Somewhere along in the bitterness  
有点儿讽刺  
And I would have stayed up with you all night  
我该整晚陪着你  
Had I known how to save a life  
如果我知道怎样拯救你  
Let him know that you know best  
告诉他你很清楚是怎么回事  
Cause after all you do know best  
因为毕竟你确实很清楚  
Try to slip past his defense ， Without granting innocence  
试着忽略他罪恶的防御  
Lay down a list of what is wrong  
给不对劲的事列张单子  
The things you've told him all along  
就是那些你以前告诉过他的事  
And pray to God he hears you  
然后就祈祷他能听到吧  
And pray to God he hears you  
但愿他听的到  
Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend  
我做错什么了吗？  
就这样少了一个朋友

Had I known how to save a life  
如果我知道怎样拯救你  
As he begins to raise his voice  
他开始提高声音  
You lower yours and grant him one last choice  
你的声音却低了，赐予了他最后的选择  
Drive until you lose the road  
继续如此直至迷失  
Or break with the ones you've followed  
或是摒弃曾经遵守的信条  
He will do one of two things  
他将会选择其一  
He will admit to everything  
他将会承认一切  
Or he'll say he's just not the same  
也或许他会说他已经变了  
And you begin to wonder why you came
