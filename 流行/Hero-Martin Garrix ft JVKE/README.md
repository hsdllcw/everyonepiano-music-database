### Hero歌词：

Can't you see you're not ready  
My arms are getting heavy  
From the weight of the world  
It's up to me and I'm getting  
Sweaty is it too much to hold  
A thousand voices  
Whisper noise  
They plan my fall from grace  
Woah oh  
I know  
Say you want a hero  
You don't  
Say you wanna savior  
Pull you off the ground  
Then you wanna blame me  
When you're falling down  
Woah oh  
I know  
Don't wanna be your hero  
Oh no  
When's it gonna sink in  
That we're sinkin and fallin apart  
Cause love don't last in the dark  
Can't you see you got old  
You waited too long and you let time go  
Placed your bets when it all comes down  
Fold your cards and you blame the house  
A thousand voices  
Whisper noise  
They plan my fall from grace  
Woah oh  
I know  
Say you want a hero  
You don't  
Say you wanna savior  
Pull you off the ground  
Then you wanna blame me  
When you're falling down  
Woah oh  
I know  
Don't wanna be your hero  
Oh no  
When's it gonna sink in  
That we're sinkin and fallin apart  
Cause love don't last in the dark  
Woah oh  
Woah oh  
Love don't last in the dark  
Woah oh  
Woah oh  
Can't you see you got old  
You waited too long and you let time go  
Placed your bets when it all comes down  
Fold your cards and you blame the house  
Woah oh  
I know  
Say you want a hero  
You don't  
Say you wanna savior  
Pull you off the ground  
Then you wanna blame me  
When you're falling down  
Woah oh  
I know  
Don't wanna be your hero  
Oh no  
When's it gonna sink in  
That we're sinkin and fallin apart  
Cause love don't last in the dark
