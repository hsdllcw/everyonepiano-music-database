### Young Again歌词：

When I was a boy, I dreamed of a place in the sky  
Playing in the fields, battling with my shields,

I wish I could see this world again through those eyes  
See the child in me, in my fantasy  
Never growing old

Will we ever feel young, again  
Will we ever feel young, again  
Will we ever feel young, again

You wanna feel young  
You wanna feel young, again

When I was a boy, I searched for a world that's unknown  
All we have is fun, everybody runs, until the sun goes down

I wish I could see this world again through those eyes  
See the child in me, in my fantasy  
Never growing old

Will we ever feel young, again  
Will we ever feel young, again  
Will we ever feel young, again

You wanna feel young  
You wanna feel young, again
