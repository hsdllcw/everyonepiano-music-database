### All I Know So Far歌词：

I haven't always been this way  
I wasn't born a renegade  
I felt alone, still feel afraid  
I stumble through it anyway  
I wish someone would've told me that this life is ours to choose  
No one's handing you the keys or a book with all the rules  
The little that I know I'll tell to you  
When they dress you up in lies and you're left naked with the truth  
You throw your head back  
And you spit in the wind  
Let the walls crack  
'Cause it lets the light in  
Let 'em drag you through hell  
They can't tell you to change who you are  
(That's all I know so far)  
And when the storm's out  
You'll run in the rain  
Put your sword down  
Dive right into the pain  
Stay unfiltered and loud  
You'll be proud of that skin full of scars  
That's all I know so far  
That's all I know so far  
So you might give yourself away, yeah  
And pay full price for each mistake  
But when the candy coating hides the razor blade  
You can cut yourself loose and use that rage  
I wish someone would've told me that this darkness comes and goes  
People will pretend but, baby girl, nobody knows  
And even I can't teach you how to fly  
But I can show you how to live like your life is on the line  
You throw your head back  
And you spit in the wind  
Let the walls crack  
'Cause it lets the light in  
Let 'em drag you through hell  
They can't tell you to change who you are  
(That's all I know so far)  
And when the storm's out  
You'll run in the rain  
Put your sword down  
Dive right into the pain  
Stay unfiltered and loud  
You'll be proud of that skin full of scars  
That's all I know so far  
That's all I know, that's all I know so far  
That's all I know, that's all I know so far  
That's all I know, that's all I know so far  
That's all I know, that's all I know so far  
I will be with you till the world blows up, yes  
Up and down and through till the world blows up, yeah  
When it's right or it's all fucked up  
Till the world blows up, till the world blows up  
And we will be enough  
And until the world blows up  
Just throw your head back  
And spit in the wind  
Let the walls crack  
'Cause it lets the light in  
Let 'em drag you through hell  
They can't tell you to change who you are  
And when the storm's out  
You'll run in the rain  
Put your sword down  
Dive right into the pain  
Stay unfiltered and loud  
You'll be proud of that skin full of scars  
That's all I know so far  
That's all I know, that's all I know so far  
That's all I know, that's all I know so far  
That's all I know, that's all I know so far  
That's all I know, that's all I know so far  
I will be with you till the world blows up
