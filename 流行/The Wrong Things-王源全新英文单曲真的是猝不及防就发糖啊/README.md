### The Wrong Things歌词：

No it wasn't meant to be  
But all the words you said to me are still so clear  
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me  
And I pretend that I can see you laying here  
If I'm supposed to heal in time  
Should you still be on my mind like you are  
Cuz I've been living with the fear  
That this pain won't disappear from my heart  
Sometimes the wrong things feel so right  
Sometimes the lights shine brighter at night  
Sometimes the truth's a lie  
So when you ask me how I am I say fine  
So when you ask me how I am I say fine  
It's impossible to quit  
When every thought of you's a hit that keeps me high  
All the memories make me numb  
But they're barely just enough to get me by  
You know I wonder all the time  
If I occupy your mind at all  
I'm embarrassed to confess  
I'm not strong enough to let you go  
Sometimes the wrong things feel so right  
Sometimes the lights shine brighter at night  
Sometimes the truth's a lie  
So when you ask me how I am I say fine  
So when you ask me how I am I say fine  
I'm embarrassed to confess  
I'm not strong enough to let you go  
The wrong things feel so right  
Sometimes the lights shine brighter at night  
Sometimes the truth's a lie  
So when you ask me how I am I say fine  
So when you ask me how I am I say fine  
Won't you please ask me how I am  
So I would like to say I am fine
