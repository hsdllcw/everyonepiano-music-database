### Pull Up歌词：

Whoa, oh oh oh oh  
Whoa, oh oh oh oh  
Whoa, oh oh oh oh  
Whoa, oh oh oh oh  
Didn't think I'd be here,  
Lost my way but can you help me?  
Wasn't always so clear, down this road  
Now I'm trying to break free  
I've been losing my my mind  
I've been drifting down, down, down  
I can't sleep at night  
Been going around, round, round  
Ay, I was so lost, confused,  
Didn't know why, who, how to pull through  
In a world I thought I knew, though was too hard  
But I was a fool  
I've been going nowhere  
Need to know if you care  
Are you gonna save me  
Cos I've been acting crazy  
Pull Up  
There's nothing to gain, and I'm feeling the pain  
Pull Up  
Don't say anymore, cos I'm losing control  
Pull Up  
Cos I'm running low  
Pull Up  
But I can't let go  
Baby, telling me all the time  
Got me saying what's on my mind  
I can't tell what's up or down  
I don't know my left from right  
Think I'll start it again  
(Again and again)  
Second chances don't come easily  
I'm not gonna pretend,  
Never thought that things would be the same,  
Will it ever end?  
Holding out for something new,  
I'm making a stand, and I'm gonna make it through  
I've been going nowhere  
Need to know if you care  
Are you gonna save me  
Cos I've been acting crazy  
Pull Up  
There's nothing to gain, and I'm feeling the pain  
Pull Up  
Don't say anymore, cos I'm losing control  
Pull Up  
Cos I'm running low  
Pull Up  
But I can't let go  
Need a little honesty  
Tell me what you need from me  
Show me that you're ready  
Cos I'm ready too  
I don't care, I'm in control  
Gotta let go, oh-ohhhh  
Pull Up  
There's nothing to gain, and I'm feeling the pain  
Pull Up  
Don't say anymore, cos I'm losing control  
Pull Up  
Cos I'm running low  
Pull Up  
But I can't let go  
Pull Up  
There's nothing to gain, and I'm feeling the pain  
Pull Up  
Don't say anymore, cos I'm losing control  
Pull Up  
Cos I'm running low  
Pull Up  
But I can't let go
