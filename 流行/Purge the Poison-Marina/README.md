### Purge the Poison歌词：

All my friends are witches and we live in Hollywood  
Mystical b***hes making our own sisterhood  
Whilst society is falling we are quietly reforming  
Protecting the planet healing our own damage  
Quarantined all alone Mother Nature's on the phone  
"What have you been doing  
Don't forget I am your home  
Virus come fires burn until human beings learn  
From every disaster you are not my master"  
Need to purge the poison show us our humanity  
All the bad and good racism and misogyny  
Nothing's hidden anymore capitalism made us poor  
God forgive America for every single war  
Need to purge the poison from my system  
Until human beings listen  
Tell me who'd you think you are  
It's your own decision  
But your home is now your prison  
You forgot that without me you won't go far  
Need to purge the poison from our system  
Until human beings listen  
Tell me who'd you think you are  
2007 when size zero was the ⁣⁣⁣rage  
Britney shaved her head and  
All we did was call her crazed  
Harvey Weinstein's gone to jail  
Me too went on to unveil  
Truth and all its glory  
The ending of a story  
It's a new world order everything just falls away  
Our life as we knew it now belongs to yesterday  
Inside all the love and hate we can now regenerate  
Stopped how we'd been living every single day  
Need to purge the poison from our system  
Until human beings listen  
Tell me "who'd you think you are  
It's your own decision  
But your home is now your prison  
You forgot that without me you won't go far  
Need to purge the poison from our system  
Until human beings listen  
Tell me who'd you think you are  
I just want a world where I can see the feminine  
We only make up one-quarter of the government  
Like an angel gone to hell  
Cast the moon under our spell  
Owning female power taking back what's ours  
Earth is like a white rose  
Quiet cloud of petals cold  
A place so corrupt where  
Angel flesh and blood is sold  
The feminine is born as new  
Studded with a diamond dew  
Saw the dawn was coming everybody knew  
Need to purge the poison from our system  
Until human beings listen  
Tell me who'd you think you are  
It's your own decision  
But your home is now your prison  
You forgot that without me you won't go far  
Need to purge the poison from our system  
Until human beings listen  
Tell me who'd you think you are  
It's your own decision  
But your home is now your prison  
You forgot that without me you won't go far
