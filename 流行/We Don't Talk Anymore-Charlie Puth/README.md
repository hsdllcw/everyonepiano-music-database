### We Don't Talk Anymore歌词：

[Charlie Puth:]  
We don't talk anymore  
We don't talk anymore  
We don't talk anymore  
Like we used to do  
We don't laugh anymore  
What was all of it for  
Ohh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do...

I just heard you found the one, you been looking  
You been looking for  
I wish I would have known that wasn't me  
Cause even after all this time  
I still wonder  
Why I can't move on  
Just the way you did so easily

Don't wanna know  
Kinda dress you're wearing tonight  
If he's holdin onto you so tight  
The way I did before  
I overdosed  
Shoulda known your love was a game  
Now I can't get you out of my brain  
Ohh, it's such a shame

That we don't talk anymore  
We don't talk anymore  
We don't talk anymore  
Like we used to do  
We don't laugh anymore  
What was all of it for?  
Oh, we don't talk anymore  
Like we used to do

[Selena Gomez:]  
I just hope you're lying next to somebody  
Who knows how to love you like me  
There must be a good reason that you're gone  
Every now and then I think you might want me to  
Come show up at your door  
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong

Don't wanna know  
If you're looking into her eyes  
If she's holdin onto you so tight the way I did before  
I overdosed  
Should've known your love was a game  
Now I can't get you out of my brain  
Oh, it's such a shame

[Charlie Puth & Selena Gomez:]  
That we don't talk anymore  
(We don't we don't)  
We don't talk anymore  
(We don't we don't)  
We don't talk anymore  
Like we used to do  
We don't laugh anymore  
(We don't we don't)  
What was all of it for?  
(We don't we don't)  
Oh, we don't talk anymore  
Like we used to do  
Like we used to do

Don't wanna know  
Kinda dress you're wearing tonight  
If he's giving it to you just right  
The way I did before  
I overdosed  
Should've known your love was a game  
Now I can't get you out of my brain  
Oh, it's such a shame

That we don't talk anymore  
(We don't we don't)  
We don't talk anymore  
(We don't we don't)  
We don't talk anymore  
Like we used to do  
We don't laugh anymore  
(We don't we don't)  
What was all of it for?  
(We don't we don't)  
Oh, we don't talk anymore  
Like we used to do

(We don't talk anymore)  
Don't wanna know  
Kinda dress you're wearing tonight (Oh)  
If he's holding onto you so tight (Oh)  
The way I did before  
(We don't talk anymore)  
I overdosed  
Should've known your love was a game (Oh)  
Now I can't get you out of my brain (Woah)  
Oh, it's such a shame  
That we don't talk anymore
