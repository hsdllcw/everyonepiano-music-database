### One歌词：

When I saw you for the first time  
I knew you were the one  
You didn't say a word to me  
But love was in the air  
Then you held my hand  
Pulled me into your world  
From then on my life  
Has changed for me  
Now I'll never feel lonely again  
Coz you are in my life  
Love  
How can I explain to you  
The way I feel inside when I think of you  
I thank you for everything that you showed me  
Don't you ever forget that I love you  
Love I know that someday real soon  
You'll be right next to me  
Holding me so tight  
So I will always be yours  
Although we can't be together now  
Remember I am here for you  
And I know you're there for me  
Whenever I want to be with you  
I just close my eyes and pretend you're near  
I see you I touch you I feel you like real  
Nothing can ever change what I feel inside  
How long must I be far away from you  
I don't know dear but I know we are one
