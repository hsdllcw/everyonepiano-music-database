今天小编为大家提供的是ZAYN新专辑中的第三首歌曲 **Entertainer简谱**
以及五线谱，个人觉得整首歌的风格蛮黯淡又低沉的，像是一个人在房内默默地自言自语，编曲上也很简单，没有太多的起伏，但却不知道为什么，有种吸引人的魔力，让人轻轻地随著音乐摇摆！

根据对 ZAYN
的採访，他说这张全新专辑想带给大家不一样的感受，是一种让人眼睛为之一亮的感觉，而不是那种，喔，啊，不就是那几首红歌，因此现在只能先保密，等到了专辑发行的时候，会让大家看到他全新的一面！而目前一系列歌曲，都是在讲一个故事。这首
_Entertainer_
在唱的是关于在感情中，一方玩弄着另一方，还以为对方不知情，但其实对方全部都知道，只是不愿意说，直到最后，才说，对不起其实我早已看透了你，我只不过是把你当成一个娱乐家，每天制造娱乐，让我笑笑，未来，我不会再继续帮助你也不会再和你走下去了。

### Entertainer歌词：

You thought you had me did you  
When you lied to my face I could see the truth  
Every step with the way I knew  
How you fooled me both  
Guess you didn't know that you were my favorite entertainer  
I watch you and laugh with and f**k with you  
Don't you tear me for a fool  
In this game I own the rules  
You were my favorite entertainer  
I watch you I laugh with with fake it too  
Don't you tear me for a fool  
I'ma show you a thing or two  
Never seen you comin' I'll turn you down  
When you need me the most I will turn you  
When you need me the most I will turn you down  
Never seen me comin' I'll turn you down  
When you need me the most I will turn you  
When you need me the most I will turn you down  
Thought that you were smarter I'm ashamed for you  
I knew it right away when you stopped lovin' me  
It happened when your touch wasn't enough for me  
Thought that you should know that you were my favorite entertainer  
I watch you and laugh with and f**k with you  
Don't you blame me for a fool  
In this game I own the rules  
You were my favorite entertainer  
I watch you I laugh with with fake it too  
Don't you blame me for a fool  
I'ma show you a thing or two  
Never seen you comin' I'll turn you down  
When you need me the most I will turn you  
When you need me the most I will turn you down  
Never seen me comin' I'll turn you down  
When you need me the most I will turn you  
When you need me the most I will turn you down  
Know it's harder to take and let's face it  
No one's playing your games let's face it  
I'm bein' straight up  
I know fake love when I see it anyway  
I'ma turn you down when you need me anyway anyway anyway  
Never seen you comin' I'll turn you down  
When you need me the most I will turn you  
When you need me the most I will turn you down  
Never seen me comin' I'll turn you down  
When you need me the most I will turn you  
When you need me the most I will turn you down  
I know you need me the most  
The most the most  
One more time
