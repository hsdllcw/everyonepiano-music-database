### This Is Gospel歌词：

This is gospel for the fallen ones  
Locked away in permanent slumber  
Assembling their philosophies  
From pieces of broken memories  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
(This is the beat of my heart)  
(This is the beat of my heart)  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
(This is the beat of my heart)  
(This is the beat of my heart)  
Their gnashing teeth and criminal tongues  
Conspire against the odds  
But they haven't seen the best of us yet  
If you love me, let me go  
If you love me, let me go  
Cause these words are knives and often leave scars  
The fear of falling apart  
Truth be told, I never was yours  
The fear, the fear of falling apart  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
(This is the beat of my heart)  
(This is the beat of my heart)  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
(This is the beat of my heart)  
(This is the beat of my heart)  
This is gospel for the vagabonds  
Ne'er-do-wells and insufferable bastards  
Confessing their apostasies  
Led away by imperfect impostors  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
(This is the beat of my heart)  
(This is the beat of my heart)  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
(This is the beat of my heart)  
(This is the beat of my heart)  
Don't try to sleep through the end of the world  
And bury me alive  
'Cause I won't give up without a fight  
If you love me, let me go  
If you love me, let me go  
Cause these words are knives and often leave scars  
The fear of falling apart  
Truth be told, I never was yours  
The fear, the fear of falling apart  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
The fear of falling apart  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
The fear, the fear of falling apart  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
The fear of falling apart  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
The fear of falling apart  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
The fear of falling apart  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
The fear of falling apart
