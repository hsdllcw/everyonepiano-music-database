音乐才子、制作人Charlie Puth夏日回归，2020年首支个人单曲 **Girlfriend**
重磅发行！洗脑旋律、骚灵律动和标志性高音，立刻带你燃情一夏！

_Girlfriend_ 延续Charlie Puth创作风格，由他自己操刀制作，和长期合作伙伴J
Kash共同写就。关于这首歌，Charlie说：“我不擅长沟通，所以大部分时间我通过音乐来表达自己的感受，而新歌“Girlfriend”就是其中一个例子。这首歌是关于坚持，坚持向对方表达爱意。这份无法停歇的爱意让人彻夜无眠，直到喜欢的人陪在身边。如果把这份感觉说出来，那显得过于炽烈了，所以我决定把它放到音乐里，这让我感觉好一些。”

同时，网站还为大家提供了《[See You Again](Music-9300-See-You-Again-钢琴伴奏谱.html "See You
Again")》曲谱下载

### Girlfriend歌词：

Yeah tired of this conversation  
We didn't come all this way  
To touch a little kiss a little all night long  
You wanna hear me say it  
I know I kept you waiting  
Just a little just a little all night long  
Can't stop 'til you're lying right here next to me  
I should stop but I think I'll do it anyway  
Baby would you ever want to be my girlfriend  
I don't wanna play no games  
This is more than just a phase  
Baby would you ever want to be my girlfriend  
If you want it let me know  
We can make this official  
Don't we look perfect baby  
Let's take this further baby  
Just a little just a little all night long  
If I was your boyfriend I I'd be giving you all my time  
Not just a little just a little all night long  
Can't stop 'til you're lying right here next to me  
I should stop but I think I'll do it anyway  
Baby would you ever want to be my girlfriend  
I don't wanna play no games  
This is more than just a phase  
Baby would you ever want to be my girlfriend  
If you want it let me know  
We can make this official  
Hold on you're making me  
Oh no baby no  
Hold on you're making me  
Oh no baby my  
Girlfriend  
Hold on you're making me  
Oh no baby my  
Hold on you're making me  
Oh no baby my  
Girlfriend  
Can't stop  
Oh no I should stop  
But I had to do it anyway  
But I had to do it anyway  
But I had to do it anyway  
But I had to do it anyway  
Baby would you ever want to be my girlfriend  
I don't wanna play no games  
This is more than just a phase  
Baby would you ever want to be my girlfriend  
If you want it let me know  
We can make this official  
Hold on you're making me  
Oh no baby no  
Hold on you're making me  
Oh no baby my  
Girlfriend  
Hold on you're making me  
Oh no baby my  
Hold on you're making me  
Oh no baby my  
Girlfriend
