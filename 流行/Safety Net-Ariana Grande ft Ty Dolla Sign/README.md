### Safety Net歌词：

Ah  
You know you're really something yeah  
How we get here so d**n fast  
Only you could tell me that  
Baby cause you know I'm coming back  
You're making me forget my past  
Never thought I'd feel like that again  
I came to peace with my past  
Now you got me off track  
I've never been this scared before  
Feelings I just can't ignore  
Don't know if I should fight or fly  
But I don't mind  
Mmh  
Tripping falling with no safety net  
Boy it must be something that you said  
Is it real this time or is it in my head  
Got me tripping falling with no safety net  
Let your guard down girl  
You know we came too far now girl  
It's time for you to play your part now  
You know we hit that jewelry store and we gon' ball out  
Ups and downs we got some fallouts  
Put some ice on you girl let it thaw  
Girl you're mine it's safe to say  
At the end of the day  
I've never been this scared before  
Feelings I just can't ignore  
Don't know if I should fight or fly  
But I don't mind  
Mmh  
Tripping falling with no safety net  
Boy it must be something that you said  
Is it real this time or is it in my head  
Got me tripping falling with no safety net  
Every time you feel some way feel the way  
Never let me run away run away my baby  
Every time you feel some way feel the way  
Never let me run away run away  
Yeah you got me tripping falling with no safety net  
Boy it must be something that you said  
Is it real this time or is it in my head  
Got me tripping falling with no safety net
