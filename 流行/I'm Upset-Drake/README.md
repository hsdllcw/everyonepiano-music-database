### I'm Upset歌词：

Yeah  
I'm working on dying  
I'm upset  
Fifty thousand on my head it's disrespect  
So offended that I had to double check  
I'ma always take the money over sex  
That's why they need me out the way  
What you expect  
Got a lot of blood and it's cold  
They keep tryna get me for my soul  
Thankful for the women that I know  
Can't go fifty fifty with no ho  
Every month I'm supposed to pay her bills  
And get her what she want  
I still got like seven years of doin' what I want  
My dad still got child support from 1991  
Outta time people love to pop a lot of sh*t then come around  
Word to Flacko Jodye he done seen us put it down  
N**gas askin' if I'm cool  
I'm upset  
Hunnid thousand on my head it's disrespect  
So offended that I had to double check  
You tryna check  
This is real life n**gas think we playin' chess  
So what's next  
Jump up out the bed like I'm possessed  
I go out on tour and I say I'm drinkin' less  
End up gettin' loose and gettin' pictures from my ex  
SMS triple x  
That's the only time I ever shoot below the neck skrr  
Why you keep on shootin' if you know that n**ga dead skrr  
That's the only kind of sh*t that gets you some respect  
Got a lot of blood and it's cold  
They keep tryna get me for my soul  
Thankful for the women that I know  
Can't go fifty fifty with no ho ayy ayy  
Every month she don't even love me she just puttin' on a front  
She gon' tryna settle outta court and make a run  
Then gon' ask me how I'm doin'  
I'm upset  
Half a million on my head I can't accept yeah  
'Least it makes me feel someone tried their best yeah  
Want to waste a half a million be my guest  
Made me wanna buy a vest and a tech skrr  
But I'm blessed I just checked  
Hate me never met me in a flesh  
Said she's got somethin's she gotta come here and collect  
That sh*t is in a box to the left to the left  
Got a lot of blood and it's cold  
They keep trynna get me for my soul  
Thankful for the women that I know  
Can't go fifty fifty with no ho
