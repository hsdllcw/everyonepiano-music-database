### Somethin' Bad歌词：

Stand on the box stomp your feet start clappin  
got a real good feeling something bad about to happen  
Somethin' Bad - Miranda Lambert  
Pulled up to the church but I got so nervous  
Had to bag it on up couldn't make it to the service  
Grabbed all the cash underneath my mattress  
Got a real good feelin something bad about to happen  
Ran into a girl in a pretty white dress  
Rolled down the window"Where you headed to miss"  
Said im headed to the bar with my money out the mattress  
Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen  
Stand on the Box stomp your feet start clappin  
Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen  
Drinks keep comin throw my head back laughin  
Wake up in the morning don't know what happened  
Oh--- Somethin Bad  
Ohh—Somethin Bad  
Now me and that girl got it made on the street  
We're rollin down the road down to new Orleans  
Got a full tank of gas and the money out the mattress  
Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen  
Bout to tear it up down in New Orleans  
Just like a real life Thelma and Louise  
If the cops catch up they gunna call it kidnapping  
Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen  
Stand on the box stomp your feet start clappin  
Got a real good feelin something bad about to happen  
Drinks keep somin throw my head back laughin  
Wake up in the morning don't know what happened  
Ohh Somwthin Bad  
Ohhh something Bad  
Stand on the box stomp your feet start clappin  
Got a real good feelin something bad about to happen  
Drinks keep somin throw my head back laughin  
Wake up in the morning don't know what happened  
Ohh Somethin Bad  
Ohh Somethin Bad
