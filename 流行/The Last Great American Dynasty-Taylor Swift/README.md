**The Last Great American Dynasty** 是由美国女歌手Taylor
Swift录唱的一首歌曲，被收录在其于2020年7月24日发行的第八张录音室专辑《Folklore》，为其所属专辑中的第3首歌曲。且空降2020年8月8日的公告牌百强单曲榜的第13位。

《Folklore》是一张突破Taylor固有风格的专辑，她的声音变得冷静而节制，不再有之前汹涌的控诉和骄傲的自信，多的是于无声处听惊雷的力量，她仿佛卸下了束缚和愤怒，转而陷入思索。隔离生活让Taylor在该专辑中变得比以往更加温柔，甚至有些忧伤，她重拾她拿手的风格，用简单的音乐形式将一个个故事娓娓道来。

### The Last Great American Dynasty歌词：

Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train  
It was sunny  
Her saltbox house on the coast  
Took her mind off St. Louis  
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name  
And money  
And the town said How did a middle class divorcée do it  
The wedding was charming  
If a little gauche  
There's only so far new money goes  
They picked out a home and called it Holiday House  
Their parties were tasteful  
If a little loud  
The doctor had told him to settle down  
It must have been her fault his heart gave out  
And they said  
There goes the last great American dynasty  
Who knows if she never showed up  
What could've been  
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen  
She had a marvelous time ruining everything  
Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set  
Forever  
Flew in all her B***h Pack friends from the city  
Filled the pool with champagne  
And swam with the big names  
And blew through the money  
On the boys and the ballet  
And losing on card game bets with Dalí  
And they said  
There goes the last great American dynasty  
Who knows if she never showed up  
What could've been  
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen  
She had a marvelous time ruining everything  
They say  
She was seen on occasion  
Pacing the rocks staring out at the midnight sea  
And in a feud with her neighbor  
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green  
50 years is a long time  
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach  
Free of women with madness  
Their men and bad habits  
Then it was bought by me  
Who knows if I never showed up what could've been  
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen  
I had a marvelous time ruining everything  
I had a marvelous time  
Ruining everything  
A marvelous time  
Ruining everything  
A marvelous time  
I had a marvelous time
