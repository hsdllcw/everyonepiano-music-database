### Samsonite Man歌词：

I don't wanna do this  
Over and over  
He's a man so full of style and grace  
Any woman be impressed  
Takes a smile and paints it on your face  
Makes you feel like you've been blessed  
Promises things so special  
Sees it comin' from a song  
Soon as you begin to feel secure, yea  
Turn around and he is gone  
Packin' his bags, gotta go, gotta go  
Packin' his bags, gotta go  
He's a Samsonite man  
Maybe he is just a rollin' stone  
Wanderin' from here to there  
Searching for a place to call his home  
Wonder if he even cares  
So many years of heartache and pain  
Is all you seem to know him for  
Is it you or is it he to blame?  
Whenever he walks out your door  
Packin' his bags, gotta go, gotta go  
Packin' his bags, gotta go  
He's a Samsonite man  
Where you're always runnin' to, away from me?  
If the wind blows you in my direction  
You come through to rendezvous  
Forget about your good intentions  
Leave me lonely and confused  
Mister Samsonite pack a bag  
That is my suggestion  
From here on out you will be leavin'  
To my discretion, yea  
So I know the game baby  
And it will never be the same  
No, no no no no  
'Cause now I got him  
Packin' his bags, gotta go, gotta go  
Packin' his bags, gotta go, gotta go  
Packin' his bags, gotta go, gotta go  
(Now you gotta go)  
Packin' his bags, gotta go  
(I can't take it no more)  
Packin' his bags, gotta go, gotta go  
(It's all I know him for)  
Packin his bags, gotta go  
He's a Samsonite man  
Why don't you just go?  
Yea yea, yea yea, woa woa, yea yea  
You can't hurt me no more, baby  
You can't touch me  
You can't hurt me no more, baby  
Gotta go, gotta go  
{Pack your bag, pack it up  
Gotta go, hit the road, Jack  
You ain't gotta go home
