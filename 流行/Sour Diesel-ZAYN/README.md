### Sour Diesel歌词：

Walks in the place hands on her waist  
Gun on her thigh big shooter game  
She did this before murdered to gain  
Promised her ma she won't kill again  
She got it and she know she got it  
I'm takin' off like a rocket  
Spaceship so high I can't stop it  
Like sour diesel  
I can't stop the feelin' yeah  
Can't stop your feet no  
Feels like I dream her  
Didn't feel it seep in  
She burn she burn she burn  
Like sour diesel  
She burn she burn she burn  
Like sour diesel  
She burn she burn she burn  
I can't stop the feelin'  
She burn she burn she burn  
Can't stop your feet no  
Like a-sour diesel  
She burn she burn she burn  
Look she burn she burn  
Like sour diesel  
The look's on her face back in my place  
Legs in the air all dirty again  
Smokin' some more I'm in her space  
She touches me there then I do it again  
She got it and she know she got it  
I'm takin' off like a rocket  
Spaceship so high I can't stop it  
Like a-sour diesel  
She burn she burn she burn  
Like a-sour diesel  
She burn she burn she burn  
I can't stop the feelin'  
She burn she burn she burn  
Can't stop your feet no  
Like a-sour diesel  
She burn she burn she burn  
Look she burn she burn  
Like sour diesel  
She burn she burn she burn  
Feels like the heat yeah  
When the flame is here  
She burn she burn she burn  
Can't stop the heat yeah  
Can't stop the feet  
She burn she burn she burn  
Like a-sour diesel  
Can't stop the feelin' oh  
She burn she burn she burn  
No I can't stop  
'Cause it's burnin' all around you  
I'm so glad I found you  
'Cause it's burnin' all around you  
I'm so glad I found you  
Woo yeah yeah
