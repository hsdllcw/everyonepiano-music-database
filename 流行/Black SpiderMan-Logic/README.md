### Black SpiderMan歌词：

Jesus, Black Jesus

Jesus, Black Jesus

Jesus, Black Jesus

Jesus, Black Jesus

I been feeling so down

I think they should know now

I think they should know what's up

Thats that road I been down

I know how it go down

I know how it go now, what's up

I feel like I don’t belong

I feel like my life is wrong

I feel like I don’t know what's up

What's up, what's up

I ain’t here to pick and choose

I ain't here to sing the blues

I’m just here to spread the clues

I’m just here to spread the news

Everybody know I do

Listen

I ain’t ashamed to be white

I ain’t ashamed to be Black

I ain’t ashamed of my beautiful Mexican wife as a matter of fact

I know you fucking with that

And I’m not scared of the people tell me I should be

Do what you love and don’t ever wonder what it could be

Everybody from my hood everybody know I’m good

Sometimes I’m misunderstood

But thats just the uneducated never related feel like I’m faded

I’m right out my mind

Tell ‘em!

Momma don’t love me

Daddy don’t love me

Wonder why I drown in the bubbly

You could be anything you wanna be

Except the person you don’t wanna be

Let him hate let em love

Wondering if everybody still like this up above

When that push come to shove

Make me wanna pull up with the gat in the glove like

I just wanna be free

Not a slave to the stereotype

All alone in my room in the middle of the night

I don’t have the words but my stereo might

I don't wanna be black, I don’t wanna be white, I just wanna be a man today

I don't wanna be a Christian, Muslim, gay, straight, or bi, see you later, bye

Not perceived by the things I believe or the color of my skin

Or the fact I’m attracted to her, maybe him

Or the fact I’m a single mother living all alone

Looking for a man and a home to call my own

But I already have one

The only man I’ma ever need is my son, my son, my son

Son, say:

Black is beautiful

Be black and proud

Fuck everybody hatin' on me right now, I’m black and proud

I’m just as white as that Mona Lisa

I’m just as black as my cousin Keisha

I’m biracial so bye Felicia

Praise Black Jesus now call the preacher

Maybe Jesus was black

Maybe Jesus had dreads

Spiderman should be black

I vote for Glover instead

Glover instead

Like what's up

I vote for more more and more and more and more and more and more

I vote for so much more

I vote for more and more

I been feeling so down

I think they should know now

I think they should know what's up

Thats that road I been down

I know how it go down

I know how it go now, what's up

I feel like I don’t belong

I feel like my life is wrong

I feel like I don’t know what's up

What's up, what's up

Ayy man

What's up, bro?

Spiderman should be Black

Yeah, I mean Spiderman should be Black

Fuck yeah

Yeah man

Black Spiderman

Black Superman

Black Santa Claus

Shit, Black Seinfeld

Black Seinfeld?

Nigga, that's Martin!

Damn, you're right...

Shit, I'm fuckin' high
