### Daylight歌词：

Telling myself I won't go there  
Oh but I know that I won't care  
Tryna wash away all the blood I've spilt  
This lust is a burden that we both share  
Two sinners can't atone from a lone prayer  
Souls tied intertwined by pride and guilt  
Ooh  
There's darkness in the distance  
From the way that I've been livin'  
Ooh  
But I know I can't resist it  
Oh I love it and I hate it at the same time  
You and I drink the poison from the same vine  
Oh I love it and I hate it at the same time  
Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight  
From the daylight runnin' from the daylight  
From the daylight runnin' from the daylight  
Oh I love it and I hate it at the same time  
Tellin' myself it's the last time  
Can you spare any mercy that you might find  
If I'm down on my knees again  
Deep down way down Lord I try  
Try to follow your light but it's nighttime  
Please don't leave me in the end  
Ooh  
There's darkness in the distance  
I'm beggin' for forgiveness  
Ooh  
But I know I might resist it oh  
Oh I love it and I hate it at the same time  
You and I drink the poison from the same vine  
Oh I love it and I hate it at the same time  
Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight  
From the daylight runnin' from the daylight  
From the daylight runnin' from the daylight  
Oh I love it and I hate it at the same time  
Oh I love it and I hate it at the same time  
You and I drink the poison from the same vine  
Oh I love it and I hate it at the same time  
Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight  
From the daylight runnin' from the daylight  
From the daylight runnin' from the daylight  
Oh I love it and I hate it at the same time
