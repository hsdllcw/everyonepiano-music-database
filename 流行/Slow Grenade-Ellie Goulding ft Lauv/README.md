**Slow Grenade** 是绵羊姐Ellie Goulding联手六公主Lauv 的最新单曲。

慢节奏搭配着空灵女嗓，和磁性男声，渐入心扉，让原本焦躁的心渐渐安静下来，心湖也被这些美妙的音符激起涟漪。其中最让人喜欢的是那段男声和合唱的部分，合唱集齐了六公主和绵羊的声线和优点，渐渐让人入迷，一耳沦陷！慢慢递进式到歌曲的高潮部分！神仙歌曲，就问你爱了吗？

### Slow Grenade歌词：

Ellie Goulding：  
Help me my God this got messy  
Least I got the best seat  
'Cause we put on one hell of a show  
Waiting I just keep on waiting  
For the final curtain  
'Cause I just can't let go of your love  
You say my name like you know my dark side ooh  
Can't beat the taste of the tears that I'll cry ooh  
Slow grenade  
It's blowing up my mistakes  
So why don't I why don't I stop it  
Still got time for me to stop it  
It's like a part of me is must want it  
That's why I'm not running from it  
Can't escape this blowing up  
In my face so why can't I  
Why can't I stop it  
Still got time for me to stop it  
It's like a part of me must love it  
That's why I'm not running from it  
Lauv：  
Crazy late nights in the city  
Drink until you hate me  
Then say that I should just let you go  
But hold on why do we still hold on  
Think that we should move on  
But we're too scared of being alone  
Ellie Goulding/Lauv：  
You say my name like you know my dark side ooh  
Can't beat the taste of the tears that I'll cry ooh  
Slow grenade  
It's blowing up my mistakes  
So why don't I why don't I stop it  
Still got time for me to stop it  
It's like a part of me is must want it  
That's why I'm not running from it  
Can't escape this blowing up  
In my face so why can't I  
Why can't I stop it  
Still got time for me to stop it  
It's like a part of me must love it  
That's why I'm not running from it  
Oooh  
Why can't I stop it  
Still got time for me to stop it  
It's like a part of me must love it  
That's why I'm not running from it  
Help me my God this got messy  
Least I got the best seat  
'Cause we put on one hell of a show  
Slow grenade  
It's blowing up my mistakes  
So why don't I why don't I stop it  
Still got time for me to stop it  
It's like a part of me is must want it  
That's why I'm not running from it  
Can't escape this blowing up  
In my face so why can't I  
Why can't I stop it  
Still got time for me to stop it  
It's like a part of me must love it  
That's why I'm not running from it  
Oooh  
Why can't I stop it  
Still got time for me to stop it  
It's like a part of me must love it  
That's why I'm not running from it
