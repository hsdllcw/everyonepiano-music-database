### Best Thing I Never Had歌词：

What goes around comes back around (hey my baby)  
What goes around comes back around (hey my baby)  
I say what goes around comes back around (hey my baby)  
What goes around comes back around...

There was a time  
I thought, that you did everything right  
No lies, no wrong  
Boy I must've been out of my mind  
So when I think of the time that I almost loved you  
You showed your ass and I, I saw the real you

Thank God you blew it  
I thank God I dodged the bullet  
I'm so over you  
So baby good lookin' out

[Chorus:]  
I wanted you bad  
I'm so through with that  
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the (best thing I never had)  
You turned out to be the (best thing I never had)  
And I'm gonna' always be the (best thing you never had)  
Oh yeah, I bet it sucks to be you right now

So sad, you're hurt  
Boo hoo, oh, did you expect me to care  
You don't deserve my tears  
I guess that's why they ain't there  
When I think that there was a time that I almost loved you  
You showed your ass and baby yes I saw the real you

Thank God you blew it  
I thank God I dodged the bullet  
I'm so over you  
Baby good lookin' out

[Chorus:]  
I wanted you bad  
I'm so through with that  
Cause honestly you turned out to be the (best thing I never had)  
I said, you turned out to be the (best thing I never had)  
And I'll never be the (best thing you never had)  
Oh baby I bet sucks to be you right now

I know you want me back  
It's time to face the facts  
That I'm the one that's got away  
Lord knows that it would take another place, another time, another world,
another life  
Thank God I found the good in goodbye

[Chorus:]  
I used to want you so bad  
I'm so through with that  
Cause honestly you turned out to be the (best thing I never had)  
Oh you turned out to be (the best thing I never had)  
And I will always be the (best thing you never had)  
Oh, best thing you never had!

I used to want you so bad  
I'm so through with that  
Cause honestly you turned out to be the (best thing I never had)  
Oh you turned out to be the (best thing I never had)  
Oh, I will never be the (best thing you never had)  
Oh baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now

What goes around, comes back around  
What goes around, comes back around  
I bet it sucks to be you right now  
What goes around, comes back around  
I bet it sucks to be you right now  
What goes around, comes back around  
I bet it sucks to be you right now
