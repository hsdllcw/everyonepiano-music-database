### Ride It歌词：

Ride it ride it come touch my soul  
Ride it ride let me feel you  
Ride it turn the lights down low  
Ride it from head to tow  
Ride it ride it touch my soul  
Ride it ride let me feel you  
It's been a month and twenty days  
And we're doing 'round and 'round just playing silly games  
Now you're saying slow it down not right now  
Then ya wink at me and walk away  
Let it be let it be let it be known  
Hold on don't go  
Touching and teasing me telling me no  
But this time I need to feel you  
Ride it we're all alone  
Ride it just lose control  
Ride it ride it come touch my soul  
Ride it ride let me feel you  
Ride it turn the lights down low  
Ride it from head to tow  
Ride it ride it touch my soul  
Ride it ride let me feel you feel you  
Vida was the club on the Saturday  
Ya actin' like a diva sayin' you don't wanna pay  
It's gotta be ya fiesty style raised eyebrow  
I love it when you look at me that way  
Now we're in you order a mojito at the bar  
You re-apply lippy 'cause it came off on the glass  
The DJ plays your favourite songs Kanye's on  
Now ya beckoning for me to dance  
Mm pullin' me pullin' me pullin' me close  
Just close your eyes girl  
Whispering tellin' me we gotta go  
Won't you take me home I want to ride it  
We're all alone  
Ride it just lose control  
Ride it ride it come touch my soul  
Ride it ride let me feel you  
Ride it turn the lights down low  
Ride it from head to tow  
Ride it ride it touch my soul  
Ride it ride let me feel you  
Ride it we're all alone  
Ride it just lose control  
Ride it ride it come touch my soul  
Ride it ride let me feel you  
Ride it turn the lights down low  
Ride it from head to tow  
Ride it ride it touch my soul  
Ride it ride let me feel you feel you feel you  
Take me full know  
Ride it we're all alone  
Ride it just lose control  
Ride it ride it come touch my soul  
Ride it ride let me feel you  
Ride it turn the lights down low  
Ride it from head to tow  
Ride it ride it touch my soul  
Ride it ride let me feel you
