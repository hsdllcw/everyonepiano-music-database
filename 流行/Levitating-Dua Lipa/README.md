**Levitating双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Levitating_ 由Dua Lipa演唱，收录于《Future Nostalgia》专辑中。此曲可谓全专最甜。
副歌的简单重复，重章叠句，却一点不让人感到厌烦，反而愈发带感。bridge的说唱配和林韵泉漱的"yeah yeah"完美地结合在一起。 Dua
Lipa很完美地唱出了一对少男少女热恋时的如胶似漆，整日卿卿我我，在花前月下讲述着那些海誓山盟，希望永远形影不离。

### Levitating歌词：

If you wanna run away with me  
I know a galaxy and I can take you for a ride  
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm  
Where the music don't stop for life  
Glitter in the sky glitter in my eyes  
Shining just the way I like  
If you feelin' like you need a little bit of company  
You met me at the perfect time  
You want me I want you baby  
My sugarboo I'm levitating  
The milky way we're renegading  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
I got you moonlight you're my starlight  
I need you all night  
Come on dance with me  
I'm levitating  
You moonlight you're my starlight  
I need you all night  
Come on dance with me  
I'm levitating  
I believe that you're for me I feel it in our energy  
I see us written in the stars  
We can go wherever so let's do it now or never  
Baby nothing's ever ever too far  
Glitter in the sky  
Glitter in our eyes  
Shining just the way we are  
I feel like we're forever every time we get together but whatever let's get
lost on mars  
You want me I want you baby  
My sugarboo I'm levitating  
The milky way we're renegading  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
I got you moonlight you're my starlight  
I need you all night  
Come on dance with me  
I'm levitating  
You moonlight you're my starlight  
I need you all night  
Come on dance with me  
I'm levitating  
You can fly away with me tonight  
You can fly away with me tonight  
Baby let me take you for a ride  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
I'm levitating  
You can fly away with me tonight  
You can fly away with me tonight  
Baby let me take you for a ride  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
My love is like a rocket watch it blast off  
And I'm feeling so electric dance my a*s off  
And even if I wanted to I can't stop  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
My love is like a rocket watch it blast off  
And I'm feeling so electric dance my a*s off  
And even if I wanted to I can't stop  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
You want me I want you baby  
My sugarboo I'm levitating  
The milky way we're renegading  
I got you moonlight you're my starlight  
I need you all night  
Come on dance with me  
I'm levitating  
You can fly away with me tonight  
You can fly away with me tonight  
Baby let me take you for a ride  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
I'm levitating  
You can fly away with me tonight  
You can fly away with me tonight  
Baby let me take you for a ride  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
I got you moonlight you're my starlight  
I need you all night  
Come on dance with me  
I'm levitating  
You moonlight you're my starlight  
I need you all night  
Come on dance with me  
I'm levitating
