### Big Girls Cry歌词：

Tough girl  
In the fast lane  
No time for love  
No time for hate  
No drama no time  
For games  
Tough girl  
Whose soul aches

[Pre-Chorus:]  
I'm at home  
On my own  
Check my phone  
Nothing though  
Act busy  
Order in  
Pay TV  
It's agony

[Chorus:]  
I may cry, ruining my makeup  
Wash away all the things you've taken  
And I don't care if I don't look pretty  
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking  
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking  
Big girls cry when their heart is breaking

Tough girl  
I'm in pain  
It's lonely at the top  
Blackouts and airplanes  
I still pour you a glass of champagne  
Tough girl  
Whose soul aches

[Pre-Chorus:]  
I'm at home  
On my own  
Check my phone  
Nothing though  
Act busy  
Order in  
Pay TV  
It's agony

[Chorus:]  
I may cry, ruining my makeup  
Wash away all the things you've taken  
And I don't care if I don't look pretty  
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking  
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking  
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking

I wake up, I wake up, I wake up  
I wake up, I wake up, I wake up  
I wake up, I wake up, I wake up  
I wake up, I wake up, I wake up,  
I wake up alone

[Chorus:]  
I may cry, ruining my makeup  
Wash away all the things you've taken  
And I don't care if I don't look pretty  
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking  
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking  
Big girls cry when their heart is breaking
