### Evolve（淬炼）歌词：

We're no stranger to the fall out  
It's what got us here  
Ever changing some chameleon  
Blood sweat and tears  
We'll never make it if we fall to everything that brings us down  
We're the come back kids now  
Blood sweat and tears  
Fight for what  
What we want  
Doesn't matter the cost  
Every day  
Put in work  
Blood sweat and tears  
Nothing comes over night  
Strength in numbers  
Dark to light  
We don't bow to fear  
Blood sweat and tears  
We are stronger now  
Blood sweat and tears  
Never backing down  
Blood sweat and tears  
Honor of the crown  
Oh no  
We don't bow to fear  
Blood sweat and tears  
Fight for what  
What we want  
Doesn't matter the cost  
Every day  
Put in work  
Blood sweat and tears  
Nothing comes over night  
Strength in numbers  
Dark to light  
We don't bow to fear  
Blood sweat and tears  
Fight for what  
What we want  
Blood sweat and tears  
Every day  
Put in work  
Fight for what  
What we want  
Nothing comes over night  
Oh  
Every day  
Put in work  
Blood sweat and tears  
Fight for what  
What we want  
Doesn't matter the cost  
Every day  
Put in work  
Blood sweat and tears  
Nothing comes over night  
Strength in numbers  
Dark to light  
We don't bow to fear  
Blood sweat and tears  
Fight for what  
What we want  
Doesn't matter the cost yeah yeah  
And every day  
We put in work  
Blood sweat and tears  
Nothing comes over night  
Strength In numbers  
Dark to light  
We don't bow to fear  
Blood sweat and tears
