### 7 Summers歌词：

Yeah you used to talk about  
Getting even further South  
Somewhere where the summer lasted all year 'round  
Probably got a big ol' diamond on your hand right now  
Maybe a baby or a couple by now  
Long driveway to a big white house  
But I wonder when you're drinking if you  
Find yourself thinking about  
That boy from East Tennessee  
And I know we both knew better  
But we still said forever  
And that was seven summers  
Of Coke and Southern Comfort  
Were we dumb or just younger who knows  
Back then you used to love the river  
And sippin' on a sixer with me  
Does it ever make you sad to know  
That was seven summers ago  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Yeah I bet your daddy's so proud  
Of how his little girl turned out  
Think she dodged a bullet  
Of a good old boy like me  
'Cause I still  
Go drinkin' same friends on Friday  
Bought a few acres couple roads off the highway  
Guess you never saw things my way anyway  
But I wonder when you're drinking if you  
Find yourself thinking about  
That boy from East Tennessee  
And I know we both knew better  
But we still said forever  
And that was seven summers  
Of Coke and Southern Comfort  
Were we dumb or just younger who knows  
Back then you used to love the river  
And sippin' on a sixer with me  
Does it ever make you sad to know  
That was seven summers ago  
Ooh  
Seven summers ago  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Seven summers ago  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Yeah I wonder when you're drinking if you  
Find yourself thinking about  
That boy from East Tennessee  
And I know we both knew better  
But we still said forever  
And that was seven summers  
Of Coke and Southern Comfort  
Were we dumb or just younger who knows  
Back then you used to love the river  
And sippin' on a sixer with me  
Does it ever make you sad to know  
That was seven summers ago  
Ooh  
Seven summers ago  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Seven summers ago  
Ooh ooh ooh
