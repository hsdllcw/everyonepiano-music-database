### Mad at Disney歌词：

I'm mad at disney disney  
They tricked me tricked me  
Had me wishing on a shooting star  
But now I'm twenty something  
I still know nothing  
About who I am or what I'm not  
So call me a pessimist  
But I don't believe in it  
Finding a true love's kiss is bulls**t  
'Cause I felt sad love  
I felt bad love  
Sometimes happy love happy love  
Turns into giving up giving up  
I felt hurt love  
About the word love  
What the hell is love supposed to feel like  
What the hell is love what the hell is love  
What the hell is love supposed to feel like  
My fairy grandma warned me  
Cinderella's story  
Only ended in a bad divorce  
The prince ain't sleeping when he  
Takes his sleeping beauty  
To the motel on his snow white horse  
So call me a pessimist  
But I don't believe in it  
Finding a true love's kiss is bulls**t  
'Cause I felt sad love  
I felt bad love  
Sometimes happy love happy love  
Turns into giving up giving up  
I felt hurt love  
About the word love  
What the hell is love supposed to feel like  
What the hell is love what the hell is love  
What the hell is love supposed to feel like  
What the hell is love what the hell is love  
What the hell is love supposed to feel like  
I'm mad at disney disney  
They tricked me tricked me  
No more wishing on a shooting star
