You Can't Win_ 是由美国歌手Kelly Clarkson创作演唱的一首歌曲，发行于2011年。You Can't
Win收录在她的第五张专辑Stronger里。
专辑辑Stronger的灵感来源包括许多很有影响力的歌手，包括、蒂娜•特纳、电台司令乐队、雪儿•克罗和艾瑞莎•弗兰克林等，并请来曾与惠特妮•休斯顿合作的制作人Rodney
Jerkins来操刀制作。Kelly表示道：“这次专辑将会是我近年来作品最接近心灵的一次，你知道我要表达的是什么吗？就好似电台司令乐队的另类说唱尽管是非主流，但是它们依然让人产生共鸣。雪儿•克罗也是这样，她是一个非常能够渲染乐迷心灵的歌手，总会创作出一些富有韵律的流行摇滚乐。”

### You Can't Win歌词：

If you go, they'll say you're following  
If you don't, then you're too good for them  
If you smile, you must be ignorant  
If you don't, what's your problem  
If you're down, so ungrateful  
And if you're happy, why so selfish?  
You can't win no, you can't win no

The one who doesn't quite fit in  
Under dressed under your skin  
Oh a walking disaster  
Every time you try to fly you end up fallin'  
Out of line  
Oh you can't, you can't win no

If you're thin, call it a walkin' disease  
If you're not, they're all screamin' obese  
If you're straight, why aren't you married yet?  
If you're gay, why aren't you waving a flag?  
If it's wrong, you'll never hit  
If it's right, you'll always miss  
You can't win, no you can't win no

The one who doesn't quite fit in  
Under dressed under your skin  
Oh a walking disaster  
Every time you try to fly you end up fallin'  
Out of line  
Oh you can't, you can't win no

And you try you try so hard  
But I swear it on your heart  
And you play you play the game  
But you pay you pay for it  
You can't win no, you can't win no

If you speak, you'll only piss them off  
If you don't, you're another robot  
If you stop, they'll just say you quit  
If you don't, you might lose your shh  
You can't win no, you can't win no  
You can't win no

The one who doesn't quite fit in  
Under dressed under your skin  
Oh a walking disaster  
Every time you try to fly you end up fallin'  
Out of line  
Oh you can't, you can't win no

I can't win  
The one who doesn't quite fit in  
Under dressed under your skin  
Oh a walking disaster  
Every time you try to fly you end up fallin'  
Out of line  
Oh you can't, you can't win no
