**Lose Somebody** 是Kygo携手OneRepublic新单。此曲为Kygo个人第三张新专辑《Golden
Hour》之一，也是双方第二次合作！

在清爽的嗓音中，这首迷人的热带浩室逐渐拉开帷幕。“有时候你只有失去了某人，才会意识到谁是今生挚爱”，一句短短的歌词通过淡雅的鼓点和歌手的演绎意义隐现，生活里我们总是抱怨当下艰难，也总是为失去而埋头叹气——却没有珍惜拥有的那段美好，没有醉心于身边之人。鼓点的渐进、消失没有特点，但心与心的距离却在拉进：
_Lose Somebody_ 持续呼喊出的是一个爱情观、一个人生观 “别等待失去”。

### Lose Somebody歌词：

It's a classic "me" mistake  
Someone gives me love  
And I throw it all away  
Tell me have I gone insane  
Talkin' to myself but I don't know what to say  
'Cause you let go  
And now I'm holdin' on  
I guess you don't know what you got  
Until it's gone  
Sometimes you gotta lose somebody  
Just to find out you really love someone  
Oh-oh and I do and I do and I do yeah  
Sometimes you gotta lose somebody  
Just to find out you really love someone  
Oh-oh yeah yeah  
Sometimes you gotta lose somebody  
So don't tell me it's too late  
Hearts are made to bend  
Baby please don't let me break yeah  
I knew I should've stayed  
'Cause now you're movin' on  
And I don't know what to say  
'Cause you let go  
Yeah you let go  
And now I'm holdin' on I'm holdin' on  
I guess you don't know what you got  
Until it's gone  
Sometimes you gotta lose somebody  
Just to find out you really love someone  
Oh-oh and I do and I do and I do yeah  
Sometimes you gotta lose somebody  
Just to find out you really love someone  
Oh-oh yeah yeah  
Sometimes you gotta lose somebody  
Sometimes you gotta lose somebody yeah  
Sometimes you gotta lose somebody yeah  
Sometimes you gotta lose somebody yeah  
Sometimes you gotta lose somebody yeah  
Sometimes you gotta lose somebody  
Just to find out you really love someone  
Oh-oh and I do and I do and I do yeah  
Sometimes you gotta lose somebody  
Just to find out you really love someone  
Oh-oh yeah yeah  
Sometimes you gotta lose somebody  
Ooh  
Sometimes you gotta lose some  
You gotta lose somebody
