### Sunday Best歌词：

Ay feeling good like I should  
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood  
Feeling blessed never stressed  
Got that sunshine on my sunday best yeah  
Everyday can be a better day despite the challenge  
All you gotta do is leave it better than you found it  
It's gonna get difficult to stand but hold your balance  
I just say whatever 'cause there is no way around it  
Everyone falls down sometimes  
But you just gotta know it'll all be fine  
It's ok uh-huh  
It's ok it's ok  
Feeling good like I should  
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood  
Feeling blessed never stressed  
Got that sunshine on my sunday best  
Somedays you wake up and nothing works you feel surrounded  
Gotta give your feet some gravity to get you grounded  
Keep good things inside your ears  
Just like the waves and sound did  
And just say whatever  
'Cause there is no way around it  
Everyone falls down sometimes  
But you just gotta know it'll all be fine  
It's ok uh-huh  
It's ok it's ok  
Feeling good like I should  
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood  
Feeling blessed never stressed  
Got that sunshine on my sunday best  
Feeling good like I should  
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood  
Feeling blessed never stressed  
Got that sunshine on my sunday best
