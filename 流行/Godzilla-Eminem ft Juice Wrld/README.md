**Godzilla双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Godzilla_ 由Eminem与Juice WRLD演唱，收录于专辑《Music To Be Murdered
By》中。Eminem的flow和押韵真的让人听的超级爽！而他们两个的声音和beat完全融合在一起，节奏感满分！只可惜Juice
WRLD英年早逝，没法继续他未完的精彩嘻哈事业，但他的音乐一定会被人们铭记的！

同时，网站还为大家提供了《[The Monster](Music-2992-The-Monster-Eminem---Rihanna.html "The

### Godzilla歌词：

Ugh you're a monster  
Eminem：  
I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla  
Better hit the deck like the card dealer  
My whole squad's in here walking around the party  
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby "The  
Brain" Heenan which is probably the  
Same reason I wrestle with mania  
Shady's in this b***h I'm posse'd up  
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake  
If they sleepin' on me the h*es better get insomnia  
ADHD hydroxycut  
Pass the Courvoisier  
Hey hey  
In AA with an AK melee finna set it like a playdate  
Better vacate retreat like a vacay mayday  
This beat is cray-cray Ray J H-A-H-A-H-A  
Laughing all the way to the bank I spray flames  
They cannot tame or placate the  
Juice WRLD/Eminem：  
Monster  
You get in my way I'ma feed you to the monster  
Yeah  
I'm normal during the day but at night turn to a monster  
Yeah  
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers  
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters  
Godzilla fire spitter monster  
Blood on the dance floor and Louis V carpet  
Fire Godzilla fire monster  
Blood on the dance floor and Louis V carpet  
Eminem：  
I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx told 'em lick the balls  
Had 'em just appalled did so many things that pissed 'em off  
It's impossible to list 'em all  
And in the midst of all this  
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball  
Tryna see will I still be like this tomorrow  
Risperdal voices whisper  
My fist is balled back up against the wall pencil drawn  
This is just the song to go ballistic on  
You just pulled a pistol on a guy with a missile launcher  
I'm just a Loch Ness the mythological  
Quick to tell a b***h screw off like a fifth of Vodka  
When you twist the top of the bottle I'm a  
Juice WRLD/Eminem：  
Monster  
You get in my way I'ma feed you to the monster  
Yeah  
I'm normal during the day but at night turn to a monster  
Yeah  
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers  
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters  
Godzilla fire spitter monster  
Blood on the dance floor and Louis V carpet  
Fire Godzilla fire monster  
Blood on the dance floor and Louis V carpet  
Eminem：  
If you never gave a d**n raise your hand  
'Cause I'm about to set trip vacation plans  
I'm on point like my index is so all you will ever get is  
The motherf**kin' finger  
Finger  
Prostate exam  
'Xam  
How can I have all these fans and perspire  
Like a liar's pants I'm on fire  
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire  
These chicks are spazzin' out I only get more handsome and flyer  
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers  
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw  
'Cause I caught the flack but my dollars  
Stacked right off the bat like a baseball  
Like Kid Ink b***h  
I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy  
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk  
Cheesecake yeah  
B***h I'm a player I'm too motherf**kin' stingy for Cher  
Won't even lend you an ear ain't even pretending to care  
But I tell a b***h I'll marry her if she'll bury her  
Face in my genital area the original Richard Ramirez  
Cristhian Rivera 'cause my lyrics never sit well  
So they wanna give me the chair  
Like a paraplegic and it's scary call it Hari Kari  
'Cause every Tom and d**k and Harry carry a Merriam motherf**kin' dictionary  
On 'em swearing up and down they can spit this s**t's hilarious  
It's time to put these b***hes in the obituary column  
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem  
Get the shaft like a steering column  
Monster  
Trigger happy pack heat but it's black ink  
Evil half of the Bad Meets  
Evil that means take a back seat  
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single  
Look at my rap sheet what attracts these people  
Is my 'Gangsta b***h' like Apache with a catchy jingle  
I stack chips you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto  
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em  
Other words I Minute Maid 'em  
I don't wanna hurt 'em but I did I'm in a fit of rage  
I'm murderin' again nobody will evade  
I'm fittin' to kill 'em and dumpin' their f**kin' bodies in the lake  
Obliterating everything incinerate a renegade  
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid  
But don't nobody want it but they're gonna get it anyway  
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill  
I'm Attila kill or be killed I'm a killer bee the vanilla gorilla  
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me  
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me  
Or be on the receivin' end of me what stupidity it'd be  
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter  
When I'm in the vicinity motherf**ker you better duck  
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me  
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me  
I'm 'bout to f**kin' finish you b***h I'm unfadable  
You wanna battle I'm available I'm blown up like an inflatable  
I'm undebatable I'm unavoidable I'm unevadable  
I'm on the toilet bowl  
I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full  
I'm not afraid to pull a  
Man stop  
Look what I'm plannin' haha
