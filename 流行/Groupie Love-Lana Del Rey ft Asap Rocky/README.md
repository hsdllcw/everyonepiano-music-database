### Groupie Love歌词：

You're in the bar playing guitar  
I'm trying not to let the crowd next to me  
It's so hard sometimes with the star  
When you have to share him with everybody  
You're in the club living it up  
I'm trying not to let the crowd notice me  
It's so sweet swingin' to the beat  
When I know that you're doing it all for me  
And every time you look up  
I know what you're thinking of  
I know what you're thinking of  
You want my  
Groupie love  
Groupie love  
Groupie love  
Time after time writing my lines  
Having my baby there next to me  
It's so sweet pouring you a drink  
And pretending that nothing means anything  
This is my life you by my side  
Key lime and perfume and festivals  
Taking our dreams turning them to things  
It's like magic babe isn't life wonderful  
And every time we hook up  
I know what you're thinking of  
I know what you're thinking of  
You want my  
Groupie love  
Groupie love  
Groupie love  
Front row every show like a hype man hmm  
Sing along word for word while she my bae yeah  
Side stage fans screaming causin' migraines  
Yamborghini high but she ain't on my grade  
God dang got a nigga acting irate  
My babe my babe stay on my brain yeah  
My babe made me sing to a fire escape  
City girl but she grew up in the tri-state  
She ain't got no time for no groupie love  
We don't pay no minds to the thug with a  
Love girls you and I so who do we trust  
You and I 'til the day we die  
Groupie love  
Groupie love  
Groupie love  
You are my babe  
Groupie love  
Groupie love  
Groupie love  
Groupie love
