### Greatest Love of All歌词：

I believe the children are our future 我相信儿童是我们的未来  
Teach them well and let them lead the way 好好教导他们，让他们走自己的路  
Show them all the beauty they possess inside 启发他们的内在美  
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier 给他们自尊心  
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be 让孩子们的笑声， 提醒我们的过往  
Everybody's searching for a hero 每个人都在寻找英雄  
People need someone to look up to 人们需要一位崇拜的偶像  
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs 我未曾找到能满足我需求的人  
A lonely place to be and so I learned to depend on me 注定要孤单寂寞 于是我学会了依靠我自己  
I decided long ago 很久以前，我就已经决定  
Never to walk in anyone's shadows 绝不依赖别人的提携庇荫  
If I fail, If I succeed 不论成功失败  
At least I lived as I believed 至少我依自己的信念而活  
No matter what they take from me 不论我被夺走了什么  
They can't take away my dignity 夺不走我的尊严  
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me 只因为我得到了最伟大的爱  
I've found the greatest love of all inside of me 我找到了心中至高无上的爱  
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve 至高无上的爱很容易做到  
Learning to love yourself, it is the greatest love of all 学着爱你自己那就是最伟大的爱  
I believe the children are our future  
Teach them well and let them lead the way  
Show them all the beauty they possess inside  
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier  
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be  
I decided long ago  
Never to walk in anyone's shadows  
If I fail, If I succeed  
At least I lived as I believed  
No matter what they take from me  
They can't take away my dignity  
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me  
I've found the greatest love of all inside of me  
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve  
Learning to love yourself, it is the greatest love of all  
And if by chance that special place 如果恰巧那个特别的地方  
That you've been dreaming of ——你的梦想之地  
Leads you to a lonely place 让你身陷绝境、孤立无援  
Find your strength in love 到爱中寻找力量
