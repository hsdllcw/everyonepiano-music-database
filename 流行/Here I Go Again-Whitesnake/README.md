**Here I Go Again** 是英国摇滚乐队Whitesnake所演唱的一首歌曲，收录在专辑Saints And
Sinners中。该专辑成绩不错，打入英国榜第9位。

而1987年，Whitesnake推出同名新专辑《Whitesnake》，《Whitesnake》是Whitesnake乐队的巅峰之作，销量高达850万张。乐队将以前的旧歌“
_Here I Go Again_ ”重新灌录出版，与专辑中另一首情歌“is this love
”一样，都是Whitesnake最出名的单曲之一。1988年，David Coverdale挖来了David Lee
Roth乐队的台柱，重型吉他大师Steve Vai加入乐队。在录制新专辑的时候，因为当时乐队另一吉他手手腕受伤，Steve
Vai正好可以好好施展一番。1989年推出的新作《Slip of the Tongue》之中，Steve Vai的吉他是当中的一大亮点。尽管《Slip of
the Tongue》专辑达到了白金唱片的数字，但却不如预期的成绩。

### Here I Go Again歌词：

I don't know where I'm going  
But, I sure know where I've been  
Hanging on the promises  
In songs of yesterday  
An' I've made up my mind,  
I ain't wasting no more time  
But, here I go again  
Here I go again

Tho' I keep searching for an answer,  
I never seem to find what I'm looking for  
Oh Lord, I pray  
You give me strength to carry on,  
'Cause I know what it means  
To walk along the lonely street of dreams

An' here I go again on my own  
Goin' down the only road I've ever known,  
Like a hobo I was born to walk alone  
An' I've made up my mind  
I ain't wasting no more time

I'm just another heart in need of rescue,  
Waiting on love's sweet charity  
An' I'm gonna hold on  
For the rest of my days,  
'Cause I know what it means  
To walk along the lonely street of dreams

An' here I go again on my own  
Goin' down the only road I've ever known,  
Like a hobo I was born to walk alone  
An' I've made up my mind  
I ain't wasting no more time

But, here I go again,  
Here I go again,  
Here I go again,  
Here I go...

An' I've made up my mind,  
I ain't wasting no more time

An' here I go again on my own  
Goin' down the only road I've ever known,  
Like a hobo I was born to walk alone  
'Cause I know what it means  
To walk along the lonely street of dreams

An' here I go again on my own  
Goin' down the only road I've ever known,  
Like a hobo I was born to walk alone  
An' I've made up my mind  
I ain't wasting no more time...

But, here I go again,  
Here I go again,  
Here I go again,  
Here I go,  
Here I go again...
