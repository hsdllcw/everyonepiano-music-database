《 **Space Song** 》是美国另类摇滚乐队Beach House演唱的歌曲，于2015年8月发行，收录在第五张专辑《Depression
Cherry》中。

Beach House是一支于2005年成立于马里兰州巴尔第摩的双人Dream Pop和Indie Rock乐队。他们熨人心脾的音乐与Mazzy Star和
Nico风格很像。Beach
House自从2006年发行首张同名专辑后技艺进步极其明显。录音更加清晰明快，歌曲更加饱满。这支乐队将双人流行乐队的形式发展到了极致。

### Space Song歌词：

It was late at night you held on tight  
From an empty sea a flash of light  
It will take a while to make you smile  
Somewhere in these eyes I'm on your side  
You wide eyed girls you get it right  
Fall back into place  
Fall back into place  
Tender is the night for a broken heart  
Who will dry your eyes when it falls apart  
What makes this fragile world go 'round  
Were you ever lost was she ever found  
Somewhere in these eyes  
Fall back into place  
Fall back into place  
Fall back into place  
Fall back into place  
Fall back into place  
Fall back into place  
Fall back into place  
Fall back into place
