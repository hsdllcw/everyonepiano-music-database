瑞典天团ABBA回归新单《 **Don't Shut Me Down**
》于2021年9月2日上线，他们将弦乐、钢琴滑奏技法与跃动的迪斯科旋律自如衔接，创造了辉煌而梦幻的效果，令人心醉神迷。

小编也万万没想到，在 2021 年，我们能见证一个解散长达 39 年的乐队回归。不过，他们的回归之路不会仅止《 _Don't Shut Me Down_

2022 年以全息投影技术在英国伦敦举办一场演唱会，重现 ABBA 最经典的曲目。

### Don't Shut Me Down歌词：

A while ago I heard the sound of children's laughter  
Now it's quiet so I guess they left the park  
This wooden bench is getting harder by the hour  
The sun is going down it's getting dark  
I realise I'm cold the rain begins to pour  
As I watch the windows on the second floor  
The lights are on it's time to go  
It's time at last to let him know  
I believe it would be fair to say  
You look bewildered  
And you wonder why I'm here today  
And so you should I would  
When I left I felt I'd had enough  
But in the shape and form I appear now  
I have learned to cope  
And love and hope is why I am here now  
And now you see another me I've been reloaded yeah  
I'm fired up don't shut me down  
I'm like a dream within a dream that's been decoded  
I'm fired up I'm hot don't shut me down  
I'm not the one you knew  
I'm now and then combined  
And I'm asking you to have an open mind  
And I won't be the same  
I'm not the same this time around  
Ooh  
I'm fired up don't shut me down  
Will you leave me standing in the hall  
Or let me enter  
The apartment hasn't changed at all  
I got to say I'm glad  
Once these rooms were witness to our love  
My tantrums and increasing frustration  
But I go from mad  
To not so bad in my transformation  
So now  
And now you see another me I've been reloaded yeah  
I'm fired up don't shut me down  
Don't shut me down  
I'm like a dream within a dream that's been decoded  
I'm fired up I'm hot don't shut me down  
I am not the one you knew  
I'm not the one you knew  
I'm now and then combined  
And I'm asking you to have an open mind  
And I won't be the same  
I'm not the same this time around  
Ooh  
I'm fired up don't shut me down  
You asked me not to leave  
Well here I am again  
And I love you still and so I won't pretend  
I have learned to cope  
And love and hope is why I am here now
