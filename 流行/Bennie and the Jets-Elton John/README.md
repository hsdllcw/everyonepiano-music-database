### Bennie and the Jets歌词：

Hey kids shake it loose together  
The spotlight's hitting something  
That's been known to change the weather  
We'll kill the fatted calf tonight  
So stick around  
You're gonna hear electric music  
Solid walls of sound  
Say Candy and Ronnie  
Have you seen them yet  
But they're so spaced out  
Bennie and the Jets  
Oh but they're weird  
And they're wonderful  
Oh Bennie she's really keen  
She's got electric boots a mohair suit  
You know I read it in a magazine  
Bennie and the Jets  
Hey kids plug into the faithless  
Maybe they're blinded  
But Bennie makes them ageless  
We shall survive  
Let us take ourselves along  
Where we fight our parents out  
In the streets  
To find who's right and who's wrong  
Say Candy and Ronnie  
Have you seen them yet  
But they're so spaced out  
Bennie and the Jets  
Oh but they're weird  
And they're wonderful  
Oh Bennie she's really keen  
She's got electric boots a mohair suit  
You know I read it in a magazine  
Bennie and the Jets  
Say Candy and Ronnie  
Have you seen them yet  
But they're so spaced out Bennie and the Jets  
Oh but they're weird and they're wonderful  
Oh Bennie she's really keen  
She's got electric boots a mohair suit  
You know I read it in a magazine  
Bennie and the Jets
