### All My Love歌词：

Friday night, my phone is off  
And none of my friends even know you're gone  
All these broken picture frames  
I'm sick of your face, but can't look away  
Can't go out, can't stay home  
I don't know how, how to be alone  
I keep waiting for you, waiting for you to come back  
With all of my love  
How can I sleep when you're out there?  
With all my love  
I can't believe that you left here with all my love  
Bring it back, bring it back, back, back oh woah  
All my love  
Bring it back, bring it back, back, back oh woah  
All my love  
All my love  
All my love  
Friday night locked in these sheets  
I toss and I turn where you used to be  
Can't go out, can't stay home  
I don't know how, how to be alone  
I keep waiting for you, waiting for you to come back  
With all of my love  
How can I sleep when you're out there?  
With all my love  
I can't believe that you left here with all my love  
Bring it back, bring it back, back, back oh woah  
All my love (all my love)  
Bring it back, bring it back, back, back oh woah  
All my love  
I gotta get back, get back yeah, all my love  
All my love  
I gotta get back, get back yeah, all my love
