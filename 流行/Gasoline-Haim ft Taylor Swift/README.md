劳模Taylor Swift于2021年2月19日释出HAIM混音《 **Gasoline**

Taylor的歌声产生的回响如同人间的四月天，顷刻绽放出美好的意蕴，惬意却不失典雅。Taylor的和声婉转动听，声音响起便是一个人间仙境，独唱部分给人一种惊喜，就好像明明知道会有件事发生，但仍有一抹光点照进身体，只能说Taylor真的太牛了。

### Gasoline歌词：

HAIM：  
You took me back  
But you shouldn't have  
Now it's your fault if I mess around  
I took a drag  
But I shouldn't have  
Now I'm coughing up like I  
Never smoked a pack  
HAIM：  
Gasoline pretty please  
I want to get off  
But you're such a tease  
Throw the keys back to me  
Go on and kick off your boots  
In the passenger seat  
Taylor Swift：  
I get sad you know I get sad  
And I can't look past what I'm sad about  
You did me bad  
Did me bad did me bad  
And I did it back  
Did it back did it back  
You needed a*s well what's  
Wrong with that  
HAIM/Taylor Swift：  
Gasoline  
Gasoline  
Pretty please  
Pretty Please  
I want to get off  
Gasoline  
But you're such a tease  
Throw the keys  
Throw the keys  
Back to me  
Back to me  
Go on and kick off your boots  
Gasoline  
In the passenger seat  
HAIM/Taylor Swift：  
Strike a match strike a match watch it blow  
We're watching the sunrise from the kitchen counter  
Want you bad want you bad don't you know  
When you're lying between my legs it doesn't matter  
Strike a match strike a match watch it blow  
You say you wanna go slower but I wanna go faster  
Want you bad want you bad  
Faster and faster  
HAIM：  
Gasoline pretty please  
I want to get off  
But you're such a tease
