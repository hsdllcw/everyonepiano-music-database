### Don't Say You Love Me歌词：

Don't say you miss me  
When you don't call  
Don't say you're hurtin'  
Without the scars  
Don't promise me tonight  
Without tomorrow too  
Don't say you love me  
Unless you do  
We've been close but inconsistent  
You hold my heart at a safer distance yeah  
You think words can ease the tension  
But you can't deny that something's missin'  
I need a little bit more  
I need a little bit more  
You gotta know what it's like  
I know you've been here before  
I've been waiting  
I've been patient  
But I need a little bit more  
So don't say you miss me  
When you don't call  
Don't say you're hurtin'  
Without the scars  
Don't promise me tonight  
Without tomorrow too  
Don't say you love me  
Unless you do  
Unless you do  
How am I supposed to take it  
When weeks go by and I'm still waiting  
I say I'm okay but I can't fake it yeah  
Even when I try yeah something's missing  
I need a little bit more  
I need a little bit more  
You gotta know what it's like  
I know you've been here before  
I've been waiting  
I've been patient  
But I need a little bit more  
So don't say you miss me  
When you don't call  
Don't say you're hurtin'  
Without the scars  
Don't promise me tonight  
Without tomorrow too  
Don't say you love me  
Unless you do  
Unless you do  
Don't say you love me  
Don't say you love me  
Unless you do  
Unless you do  
Don't say you love me  
Don't say you love me  
Don't promise me tonight  
Without tomorrow too  
Don't say you love me  
Unless you do  
Unless you do  
I need a little bit more  
I need a little bit more  
You gotta know what it's like  
I know you've been here before  
I've been waiting  
I've been patient  
But I need a little bit more  
Don't say you miss me  
When you don't call  
Don't say you're hurtin'  
Without the scars  
Don't promise me tonight  
Without tomorrow too  
Don't say you love me  
Unless you do
