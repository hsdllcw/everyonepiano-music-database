### What Do You Mean?歌词：

What do you mean?  
Ohh ohh ohh  
When you nod your head yes  
But you wanna say no  
What do you mean?  
Hey yeah  
When you don't want me to move  
But you tell me to go  
What do you mean?  
Ohh  
What do you mean?  
Said we're running out of time  
What do you mean?  
Ohh ohh ohh  
What do you mean?  
Better make up your mind  
What do you mean?

You're so indecisive of what I'm saying  
Trying to catch the beat, make up your heart  
Don't know if you're happy or complaining  
Don't want for us to end  
Where do I start  
First you wanna go to the left and you want to turn right  
Wanna argue all day, make love all night  
First you up then you're down and then between  
Ohh I really want to know...

What do you mean?  
Ohh ohh ohh  
When you nod your head yes  
But you wanna say no  
What do you mean?  
Hey yeah  
When you don't want me to move  
But you tell me to go  
What do you mean?  
Ohh  
What do you mean?  
Said we're running out of time  
What do you mean?  
Ohh ohh ohh  
What do you mean?  
Better make up your mind  
What do you mean?

You're overprotective when I'm leaving  
Trying to compromise but I can't win  
You wanna make a point but you keep preaching  
You had me from the start, won't let this end  
First you wanna go to the left then you want to turn right  
Wanna argue all day, make love all night  
First you're up then you're down and then between  
Ohh I really wanna know...

What do you mean?  
Ohh ohh ohh  
When you nod your head yes  
But you wanna say no  
What do you mean?  
Hey yeah  
When you don't want me to move  
But you tell me to go  
What do you mean?

I want to know...  
Oh  
What do you mean?  
Ohhh  
Said we're running out of time  
What do you mean?  
(Oh baby)  
Ohh ohh ohh  
What do you mean?  
Better make up your mind  
What do you mean?  
Ohh ohh ohh  
(This is ours baby, yeah)  
When you nod your head yes  
But you wanna say no  
What do you mean?  
(You're so confusing baby)  
Hey yeah  
When you don't want me to move  
But you tell me to go  
What do you mean?  
(Be more straight forward)  
Ohh  
What do you mean?  
(Give it back back back)  
Said we're running out of time  
What do you mean?  
(Give it back back back)  
Ohh ohh ohh  
What do you mean?  
Better make up your mind  
What do you mean?
