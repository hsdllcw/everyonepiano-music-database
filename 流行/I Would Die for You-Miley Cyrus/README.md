### I Would Die for You歌词：

You are everything to me  
And I I would die for you  
There've been times where I'm up all night  
Crying in the dark so I sleep with the light on  
I've heard I've got words like a knife  
That I don't know always choose just so wisely  
But I see trees and their colored leaves  
When I think about all that we could be  
When you're gone time moves so slow  
Like the grass I've watched us grow  
I've heard you reap only what you'll sow  
How could I never let you know  
That you are everything to me  
You're sweeter than candy and better than any childhood dream  
I am yours and you are mine  
I have your heart I don't even need a ring  
I'd give up all I have in exchange for who I love more than anything  
When you're gone time moves so slow  
Like the grass I've watched us grow  
I've heard you reap only what you'll sow  
How could I ever let you go  
You you're everything to me  
And I I would die for you  
I would die  
When you're gone  
For you  
Time moves so slow  
I would die  
Like the grass I've watched us grow  
I would die  
I've heard you reap only what you'll sow  
I would die  
How could I never let you know  
I would die for you
