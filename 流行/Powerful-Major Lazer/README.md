### Powerful歌词：

Oh my, my, my, what you do to me  
Like lighting when I'm swimming in the sea  
From the very first time we loved  
From the very first time we touched  
Walking on wires and power lines  
You put your body on top of mine  
Every time that you lift me up  
To the heavens and stars above

Ooh Lord have mercy I'm begging you, please  
I'm feeling drained, I need love  
You charge me up like electricity  
Jumpstart my heart with your love

There's an energy  
When you hold me  
When you touch me  
It's so powerful  
I can feel it  
When you hold me  
When you touch me  
It's so powerful

There's an energy  
When you hold me  
When you touch me  
It's so powerful  
I can feel it  
When you hold me  
When you touch me  
It's so powerful

I couldn't leave even if I wanted to  
'Cause something keeps pulling me back to you  
From the very first time we loved  
From the very first time we touched  
The stroke of your fingers  
The scent of your lingers  
My mind running wild  
The thoughts of your smile  
Oh, you gotta give me some  
Though you can give it all  
But it's never enough no

There's an energy  
When you hold me  
When you touch me  
It's so powerful  
I can feel it  
When you hold me  
When you touch me  
It's so powerful

I can feel it  
When you hold me  
When you touch me  
It's so powerful  
There's an energy  
When you hold me  
When you touch me  
It's so powerful

I can feel it  
When you hold me  
When you touch me  
It's so powerful  
I can feel it  
When you hold me  
When you touch me  
It's so powerful

Hold me in your arms  
Burns like a fire  
Electricity  
When you're close I feel the sparks  
Takes me higher to infinity
