### Life Is Good歌词：

Drake：  
Workin' on the weekend like usual  
Way off in the deep end like usual  
N***as swear they passed us they doin' too much  
Haven't done my taxes I'm too turnt up  
Virgil got that Patek on my wrist goin' nuts  
N***as caught me slippin' once okay so what  
Someone hit your block I'd tell you if it was us  
Manor house in Rosewood this s**t too plush  
Say my days are numbered but I keep wakin' up  
Know you see my texts baby please say some  
Wine by the glass your man a cheapskate huh  
N***as gotta move off my release day huh  
B***h this is fame not clout  
I don't even know what that's about watch your mouth  
Baby got a ego twice the size of the crib  
I can never tell her s**t it is what it is  
Said what I had to and did what I did  
Never turn my back on FBG God forbid  
Virgil got the Patek on my wrist doin' front flips  
Givin' you my number but don't hit me on no dumb s**t  
Workin' on the weekend like usual  
Way off in the deep end like usual  
N***as swear they passed us they doin' too much  
Haven't done my taxes I'm too turnt up  
Virgil got that Patek on my wrist goin' nuts  
N***as caught me slippin' once okay so what  
Someone hit your block I'd tell you if it was us  
Manor house in Rosewood this s**t too plush  
Future：  
It's cool man got red bottoms on  
Life is good you know what I mean  
Like

On a n***a finger lil' b***h woo  
I done flew one out to Spain to be in my domain  
And Audemar'd the b***h woo  
Dropped three dollars on a ring

While I catch a play on a brick woo

Had to ride with that stick woo  
Who gave you pills who gave you that desert  
Pluto sent you on licks woo

Yeah I ride for my n***as I lie to my b***h woo  
We some poor high-class n***as made it we rich yeah  
I was at the bando got a penthouse for a closet woo  
It's like a chandelier on my neck my wrist woo  
I got pink toes they talk different languages woo  
Got promethazine in my blood and percocet  
Yeah hunnid thousand for the cheapest ring  
On a n***a finger lil' b***h woo  
I done flew one out to Spain to be in my domain  
And Audemar'd the b***h woo  
Dropped three dollars on a ring  
Call it Bentley truck lil' b***h woo
