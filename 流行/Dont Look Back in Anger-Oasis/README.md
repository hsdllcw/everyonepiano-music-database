### Don't Look Back in Anger歌词：

Slip inside the eye of your mind  
Don't you know you might find  
A better place to play  
You said that you'd never been  
But all the things that you've seen  
Slowly fade away  
So I start a revolution from my bed  
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head  
Step outside summertime's in bloom  
Stand up beside the fireplace  
Take that look from off your face  
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out  
And so Sally can wait  
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by  
Her soul slides away  
But don't look back in anger I heard you say  
Take me to the place where you go  
Where nobody knows if it's night or day  
Please don't put your life in the hands  
Of a rock 'n' roll band  
Who'll throw it all away  
I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed  
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head  
Step outside 'cause summertime's in bloom  
Stand up beside the fireplace  
Take that look from off your face  
'Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out  
And so Sally can wait  
She knows it's too late as she's walking on by  
My soul slides away  
But don't look back in anger I heard you say  
So Sally can wait  
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by  
Her soul slides away  
But don't look back in anger I heard you say  
So Sally can wait  
She knows it's too late as she's walking on by  
My soul slides away  
But don't look back in anger don't look back in anger  
I heard you say  
At least not today
