### Christmas Saves the Year歌词：

Snow falls down from the gray sky  
Ashes fall in the sea  
Plans are thrown to the wayside  
Frozen days of the week  
But everybody wants to make it home this year  
Even if the world is crumblin' down  
'Cause everybody's got somebody who's got their name on a shelf  
With cheap décor and flavored cheer  
You rest assured that Christmas saves the year  
Dust off old photo boxes  
This one's marked '92 yeah  
Years past seemed so much grander  
This one needs to come through  
'Cause everybody wants to makе it home this year  
Even if thе world is crumblin' down  
'Cause everybody's got somebody who's got their name on a shelf  
With cheap décor and flavored cheer  
You rest assured that Christmas saves the year  
Bum-bum-bum bum-bum-bum-bum  
Bum-bum-bum bum-bum-bum-bum-bum  
Bum-bum-bum-bum  
Everybody wants to make it home this year  
Even if the world is crumblin' down  
'Cause everybody's got somebody who's got their name on a shelf  
With cheap décor and flavored cheer  
You rest assured  
Everybody wants to make it home this year  
Even if the world is crumblin' down  
'Cause everybody's got somebody who's got their name on a shelf  
With cheap décor and flavored cheer  
You rest assured Christmas saves the year
