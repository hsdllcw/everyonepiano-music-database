### Leave Your Lover歌词：

I don't have much to give, but I don't care for gold  
What use is money, when you need someone to hold?  
Don't have direction, I'm just rolling down this road  
Waiting for you to bring me in from out the cold

You'll never know the endless nights, the rhyming of the rain,  
Or how it feels to fall behind and watch you call his name

Pack up and leave everything,  
Don't you see what I can bring  
Can't keep this beating heart at bay  
Set my midnight sorrow free,  
I will give you all of me  
Just leave your lover, leave him for me.  
Leave your lover, leave him for me.

We sit in bars and raise our drinks to growing old  
Oh, I'm in love with you and you will never know,  
But if I can't have you I'll walk this life alone  
Spare you the rising storms and let the rivers flow

You'll never know the endless nights, the rhyming of the rain  
Or how it feels to fall behind and watch you call his name

Pack up and leave everything,  
Don't you see what I can bring  
Can't keep this beating heart at bay  
Set my midnight sorrow free,  
I will give you all of me  
Just leave your lover, leave him for me  
Leave your lover, leave him for me.  
Leave your lover, leave him for me.
