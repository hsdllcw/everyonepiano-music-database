### Say Something Loving歌词：

Before it slips away  
Say something loving  
I just don't remember the thrill of affection  
I just don't remember  
Say something loving  
I need a reminder, the feeling's escaped me  
I went looking for it  
Could have been anyone's kiss  
Throwing my arms at no one  
When I gave up, I found love  
The thought flows through my mind  
And it's growing all the time  
I do myself a disservice  
To feel this weak, to be this nervous  
You say something loving  
It's so overwhelming, the thrill of affection  
Feels so unfamiliar  
You say something loving  
Without hesitation it hits me, hits me  
It feels so unfamiliar  
Before it slips away  
Your touch stays on my skin  
I feel it start sinking in  
Here come my insecurities  
I almost expect you to leave  
Were you really looking for me?  
Try your best to reassure me  
I wasn't patient to meet you  
Am I too needy, am I too eager?  
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know  
I don't know what this is, but it doesn't feel wrong  
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know  
I don't know what this is, but it doesn't feel wrong  
Did you hear me say it?  
Say it  
Did you hear me say?  
I say something loving  
I can't hold it inside, the thrill of affection  
Is only getting stronger  
I say something loving  
All my hesitations are fading, fading  
I feel it taking over  
Before it slips away  
Don't let it slip away  
Before it slips away  
Don't let it slip away
