### Six Feet Apart歌词：

When the dogwoods start to bloom  
And the crickets hum their tune  
It's usually about the time  
That I feel most alive  
But the news has all been bad  
And the world just seems so sad  
I ain't had much else going on  
So I sat down and wrote this song  
I miss my mom I miss my dad  
I miss the road I miss my band  
Giving hugs and shaking hands  
It's a mystery I suppose  
Just how long this thing goes  
There'll be crowds and there'll be shows  
And there will be light after dark  
Some day when we aren't six feet apart  
The first thing that I'm gonna do  
Slide on in some corner booth  
Take the whole d**n family out  
Buy my buddies all a round  
Pay some extra on the tab  
Catch a movie catch a cab  
Watch a ball game from the stands  
Probably over-wash my hands  
I miss my mom I miss my dad  
I miss the road I miss my band  
Giving hugs and shaking hands  
It's a mystery I suppose  
Just how long this thing goes  
There'll be crowds and there'll be shows  
And there will be light after dark  
Some day when we aren't six feet apart  
I miss my mom I miss my dad  
I miss the road I miss my band  
Giving hugs and shaking hands  
Now it's a mystery I suppose  
Just how long this thing goes  
There'll be crowds and there'll be shows  
And there will be light after dark  
Some day when we aren't six feet apart  
There will be light after dark  
Some day when we aren't six feet apart
