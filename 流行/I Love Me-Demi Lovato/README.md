**I Love Me双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_I Love Me_ 是美国流行歌手Demi Lovato的单曲。
歌曲一开始的编曲让人有点害怕，Anne的风格过强，导致开头不像是Demi的歌，更像是Anne的歌，结果后面瞬间爆发，Demi的摇滚风格瞬间凸现，但就在你以为要持续爆发的时候，她却突然收住了，编曲仿佛在和听歌的人玩躲猫猫的游戏。

### I Love Me歌词：

Flippin' through all these magazines  
Tellin' me who I'm supposed to be  
Way too good at camouflage  
Can't see what I am I just see what I'm not  
I'm guilty 'bout everything that I eat  
Feelin' myself is a felony  
Jedi level sabotage  
Voices in my head make up my entourage  
'Cause I'm a black belt when I'm beating up on myself  
But I'm an expert at giving love to somebody else  
I me myself and  
I don't see eye to eye  
Me myself and I  
Oh why do I compare myself to everyone  
And I always got my finger on the self-destruct  
I wonder when I love me is enough  
Yeah yeah yeah  
I wonder when I love me is enough  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Why am I always looking for a ride or die  
'Cause mine's the only heart I'm gonna have for life  
After all the times I went and f**ked it up  
All the times I went and f**ked it up  
I wonder when I love me is enough  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
I wonder when I love me is enough  
I wonder when I love me is enough  
Haters that live on the internet  
Live in my head should be paying rent  
I'm way too good at listening  
All these comments f**king up my energy  
'Cause I'm a black belt when I'm beating up on myself  
But I'm an expert at giving love to somebody else  
I me myself and  
I don't see eye to eye  
Me myself and I  
Oh why do I compare myself to everyone  
And I always got my finger on the self-destruct  
I wonder when I love me is enough  
Yeah yeah yeah  
I wonder when I love me is enough  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Why am I always looking for a ride or die  
'Cause mine's the only heart I'm gonna have for life  
After all the times I went and f**ked it up  
All the times I went and f**ked it up  
I wonder when I love me is enough  
Is enough  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
I wonder when I love me is enough  
I wonder when I love me is enough  
I'm my own worst critic  
Talk a whole lot of s**t  
But I'm a ten out of ten  
Even when I forget  
I I I I  
I'm a ten out of ten don't you ever forget it  
I'm my own worst critic  
Talk a whole lot of s**t  
But I'm a ten out of ten  
Even when I forget  
I I I I  
Yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
I wonder when I love me is enough  
I wonder when I love me is enough  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
I wonder when I love me is enough  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
