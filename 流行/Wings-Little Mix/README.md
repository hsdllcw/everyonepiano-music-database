Wings_ 是英国女子组合Little Mix于2012年8月26日释放的一首单曲，来自于她们的专辑DNA。

  
Little Mix（小混合、小混混）是由Perrie Edwards, Jesy Nelson, Leigh-Anne Pinnock及Jade
Thirlwall所组成的英国少女团体。她们因打破传统成为英国人气歌唱比赛The X
Factor史上第一个夺冠的团体而成名，除此之外，她们的夺冠经历更改写了女子团体在比赛中一定走不远的命运。Little Mix不仅改写了The X
Factor的历史，赛后也有傲人的成绩，她们是自2005年以来第一个不用在The X Factor上表演就能够首单空降英国单曲榜的冠军。

### Wings歌词：

Mamma told me not to waste my life  
母亲教导 勿虚度光阴  
She said spread your wings my little butterfly  
小小蝴蝶 请展翅翱翔  
Don't let what they say keep you up at night  
勿因他人之语 辗转难眠  
And if they give you up  
倘若被人放弃  
Then they can walk on by  
随他们去  
My feet, feet can't touch the ground  
我已双脚离地  
And I can't hear a sound  
不闻任何声音  
But you just keep on running up your mouth yeah  
你仍唠叨不停  
Walk, walk on over there  
你大可继续  
Cos I'm too fly to care, oh yeah  
我已起飞 不再介怀  
Your words don't mean a thing

I'm not listening  
我充耳不闻  
Keep walking, all I know is
