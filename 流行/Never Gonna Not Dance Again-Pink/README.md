### Never Gonna Not Dance Again歌词：

If someone told me that the world would end tonight  
You could take all that I got for once I wouldn't start a fight  
You could have my liquor take my dinner take my fun  
My birthday cake my soul my dog take everything I love  
But oh one thing I'm never gonna do  
Is throw away my dancing shoes and  
Oh lord don't try me really not tonight  
I'll lay down and die I'll scream and I'll cry  
We've already waste enough time  
I'm never gonna not dance again  
I'm never gonna not dance again  
Oh I just wanna pop and lock to my records  
There go all of my clothes  
Never gonna not dance again  
Oh  
D-d-d-dance I'm gonna dance bruh  
D-d-d-dance I'm gonna dance  
I want my life to be a Whitney Houston song  
I wanna dance  
I got all good luck and zero ***** don't care if I belong no  
If I could kill the thing that makes us all so dumb  
We're never getting younger so I'm gonna have some fun  
'Cause oh one thing I'm never gonna do  
Is throw away my dancing shoes and  
Oh lord don't try me really not tonight  
I'll lay down and die I'll scream and I'll cry  
Know that I'm starting a fight  
I'm never gonna not dance again  
I'm never gonna not dance again  
Oh I just wanna pop and lock to my records  
There go all of my clothes  
Never gonna not dance again  
Oh  
D-d-d-dance I'm gonna dance bruh  
D-d-d-dance I'm gonna dance  
D-d-d-dance I'm gonna dance yeah d-d-d-dance  
I'll lay down and die I'll scream and I cry  
You know that I'm starting a fight  
Fight  
I'll lay down and die I'll scream and I cry  
We've already waste enough time  
We've already waste enough time  
I'm never gonna not dance again  
I'm never gonna not dance again  
Oh I just wanna pop and lock to my records  
There go all of my clothes  
Never gonna not dance again  
Oh  
I'm never gonna not dance again  
I'm never gonna not dance again so let the music play 'til the end  
I'm never gonna not dance again so let the music play 'til the end  
I'm never gonna not dance again so let the music play 'til the end  
I'm never gonna not dance again so let the music play 'til the end  
I'm never gonna not dance again so let the music play 'til the end  
I'm never gonna not dance again so let the music play 'til the end
