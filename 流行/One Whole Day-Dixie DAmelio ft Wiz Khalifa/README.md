### One Whole Day歌词：

We'd be laying in my bed  
And you'd randomly get up and leave  
You would make a lot of time  
For anyone other than me-e-e  
The more that I gave the more you held back  
Now I am emotionally starved  
You're stuck on your ex you're stuck in the past  
Truth is that you really broke my heart  
For one day one day  
I was really really really really sad  
For one day one whole day  
I missed you really really really bad  
And the single tear trickled down my face  
While I threw your s**t in the fireplace  
I was really really really really sad  
For one day one whole day  
I woke up and it was strange  
All that I felt was relieved  
No more feelings I can dust  
I'm cringing at those memories  
Like the time that you left me alone at the party  
When I didn't even know anybody  
Truth is that you really broke my heart  
Really broke my heart  
For one day one day  
I was really really really really sad  
For one day one whole day  
I missed you really really really bad  
And the single tear trickled down my face  
While I threw your s**t in the fireplace  
I was really really really really sad  
For one day one whole day  
One whole day ah-ah ah ah  
One whole day  
One whole day ah-ah ah ah  
Okay  
One whole day one whole day  
Wake up make up I wake up bake up  
Quit your cryin' why you messin' up your makeup  
Late night I stay up tryna get my money way up  
Soon as I did some wrong you approach me the day of  
You tell me it's over and you're done and you can't take no more  
You're walking out the door and I'm here like "What' you waitin' for"  
Just tryna get the truth I ain't tryna be confrontational  
Before you make a decision I'ma just let you stay for  
Uh  
For one day yeah one day  
I was really really really really sad  
For one day one whole day  
I missed you really really really bad  
And the single tear trickled down my face  
While I threw your s**t in the fireplace  
I was really really really really sad  
For one day one whole day  
One whole day ah-ah ah ah  
Shouldn't leave a man  
One whole day  
One whole day ah-ah ah ah  
I'm tryna make you plain  
One whole day one whole day
