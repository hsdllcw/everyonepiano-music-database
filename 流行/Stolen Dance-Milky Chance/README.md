### Stolen Dance歌词:

I want you by my side  
So that I never feel alone again  
They've always been so kind  
But now they've brought you away from here  
I hope they didn't get your mind  
Your heart is too strong anyway  
We need to fetch back the time  
They have stolen from us

And I want you  
We can bring it on the floor  
You've never danced like this before  
We don't talk about it  
Dancin' on do the boogie all night long  
Stoned in paradise, shouldn't talk about it

And I want you  
We can bring it on the floor  
You've never danced like this before  
We don't talk about it  
Dancin' on do the boogie all night long  
Stoned in paradise, shouldn't talk about it

Shouldn't talk about it

Coldest winter for me  
No sun is shining anymore  
The only thing I feel is pain  
Caused by absence of you  
Suspense is controlling my mind  
I cannot find the way out of here

I want you by my side  
So that I never feel alone again

And I want you  
We can bring it on the floor  
You've never danced like this before  
We don't talk about it  
Dancin' on do the boogie all night long  
Stoned in paradise, shouldn't talk about it

And I want you  
We can bring it on the floor  
You've never danced like this before  
We don't talk about it  
Dancin' on do the boogie all night long  
Stoned in paradise, shouldn't talk about it  
Shouldn't talk about it

And I want you  
We can bring it on the floor  
You've never danced like this before  
We don't talk about it  
Dancin' on do the boogie all night long  
Stoned in paradise, shouldn't talk about it

And I want you  
We can bring it on the floor  
You've never danced like this before  
We don't talk about it  
Dancin' on do the boogie all night long  
Stoned in paradise, shouldn't talk about it  
Shouldn't talk about it
