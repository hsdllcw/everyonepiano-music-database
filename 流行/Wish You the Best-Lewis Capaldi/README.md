### Wish You the Best歌词：

I miss knowing what you're thinking  
And hearing how your day has been  
Do you think you can tell me everything darling  
But leave out every part about him  
Right now you're probably by the ocean  
While I'm still out here in the rain  
With every day that passes by since we've spoken  
It's like Glasgow gets further from LA  
Maybe it's supposed to be this way  
But oh my love  
I wanna say "I miss the green in your eyes"  
And when I said we could be friends guess I lied  
I wanna say "I wish that you never left"  
Oh but instead "I only wish you the best"  
I wanna say "Without you everything's wrong"  
And you were everything I need all along  
I wanna say "I wish that you never left"  
Oh but instead "I only wish you the best"  
Well I can't help but notice  
You seem happier than ever now  
And I guess that I should tell you "I'm sorry"  
It seems I was the problem somehow  
Maybe I only brought you down  
But oh my love  
I wanna say "I miss the green in your eyes"  
And when I said we could be friends guess I lied  
I wanna say "I wish that you never left"  
Oh but instead "I only wish you the best"  
I wanna say "Without you everything's wrong"  
And you were everything I need all along  
I wanna say "I wish that you never left"  
Oh but instead "I only wish you the best"  
But oh my love  
Oh woah  
Oh my love  
Oh woah  
Wish I could say it's something I really mean  
But I want you happy whether not it's with me  
I wanna say "I wish that you never left"  
Oh but instead "I only wish you the best"  
I wanna say "Without you everything's wrong"  
And you were everything I need all along  
I wanna say "I wish that you never left"  
Oh but instead "I only wish you the best"
