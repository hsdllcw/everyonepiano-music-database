### The Fox歌词：

Ylvis

  

Dog goes woof Cat goes meow  
Bird goes tweet and mouse goes squeek  
Cow goes moo Frog goes croak  
and the elephant goes toot  
Ducks say quack and fish go blub  
and the seal goes ow ow ow  
But there's one sound  
That no one knows  
What does the fox say?  
Ring-ding-ding-ding-dingeringedding!  
gering-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding!  
gering-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding!  
What does the fox say?  
Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow!  
Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow!  
Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow!  
What does the fox say?  
Hatee-hatee-hatee-ho!  
Hatee-hatee-hatee-ho!  
Hatee-hatee-hatee-ho!  
What does the fox say?  
Joff-tchoff-tchoffo-tchoffo-tchoff!  
Tchoff-tchoff-tchoffo-tchoffo-tchoff!  
Joff-tchoff-tchoffo-tchoffo-tchoff!  
What does the fox say?  
Big blue eyes Pointy nose  
Chasing mice and digging holes  
Tiny paws Up the hill  
Suddenly you're standing still  
Your fur is red So beautiful  
Like an angel in disguise  
But if you meet a friendly horse  
Will you communicate by  
mo-o-o-o-orse? mo-o-o-o-orse? mo-o-o-o-orse?  
How will you speak to that  
ho-o-o-o-orse? ho-o-o-o-orse? ho-o-o-o-orse?  
what does the fox say?  
Jacha-chacha-chacha-chow!  
Chacha-chacha-chacha-chow!  
Chacha-chacha-chacha-chow!  
What does the fox say?  
Fraka-kaka-kaka-kaka-kow!  
Fraka-kaka-kaka-kaka-kow!  
Fraka-kaka-kaka-kaka-kow!  
What does the fox say?  
A-hee-ahee ha-hee!  
A-hee-ahee ha-hee!  
A-hee-ahee ha-hee!  
What does the fox say?  
A-oo-oo-oo-ooo! Woo-oo-oo-ooo!  
What does the fox say?  
The secret of the fox Ancient mystery  
Somewhere deep in the woods  
I know you're hiding  
what is your sound?  
Will we ever know?  
Will always be a mystery  
What do you say?  
You're my guardian angel  
hiding in the woods  
what is your sound?  
Will we ever know?  
I want to I want to I want to know
