Party Rock Anthem歌词：

  

Party rock  
Yeah  
Whoa!  
Let's go!

Party rock is in the house tonight  
Everybody just have a good time (yeah)  
And we gonna make you lose your mind (whoa!)  
Everybody just have a good time (clap!)

Party rock is in the house tonight (oh)  
Everybody just have a good time (I can feel it baby!)  
And we gonna make you lose your mind (yeah)  
We just wanna see you... shake that!

In the club party rock, lookin' for your girl,  
She on my jock (huh) non-stop when we're in the spot  
Booty move the weight like she owns the block  
Where I drank I gots to know  
Tight jeans, tattoos cause I'm rock and roll  
Half black half white, domino  
Gain the money Oprah Doe!

Yo!  
I'm running through these hoes like Drano  
I got that devilish flow rock and roll no halo  
We party rock yeah! that's the crew that I'm repping  
On a rise to the top no lead in our Zeppelin  
Hey!

Party rock is in the house tonight (whoa)  
Everybody just have a good time (yeah)  
And we gonna make you lose your mind  
Everybody just have a good time

Let's go

Party rock is in the house tonight  
Everybody just have a good time (I can feel it baby!)  
And we gonna make you lose your mind  
We just wanna see you... shake that!

Every day I'm shuffling  
Shuffling shuffling

Step up fast and be the first girl to make me throw this cash  
We get money, don't be mad, now stop – hating's bad

One more shot for us  
(Another round)  
Please fill up my cup  
(Don't mess around)  
We just wanna see  
(You shake it now)  
Now you home with me  
(You're naked now)

Get up get down put your hands up to the sound [3x]  
Put your hands up to the sound [2x]  
Get up [9x]  
Put your hands up to the sound, to the sound  
Put your hands up! [4x]

Party rock is in the house tonight (put your hands up!)  
Everybody just have a good time (put your hands up!)  
And we gonna make you lose your mind (put your hands up!)  
Everybody just have a good good good time

Oh! Oh! (Put your hands up)  
Oh! Oh! (Time to fill it now!)  
Oh! Oh! (Put your hands up)  
Oh! Oh! (Put your hands up)

Shake that!  
Every day I'm shuf-f-f-ling

Put your put your  
Put your put your (yeah yeah)  
Put your put your (whoa!)  
Put your put your  
Put your hands up  
Your hands up  
Put your hands up

Every day I'm shuffling
