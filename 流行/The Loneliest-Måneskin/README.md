聆听这首《The

### The Loneliest歌词：

You'll be the saddest part of me  
A part of me that will never be mine  
It's obvious tonight is gonna be the loneliest  
You're still the oxygen I breathe  
I see your face when I close my eyes  
It's torturous tonight is gonna be the loneliest  
There's a few lines that I have wrote  
In case of death that's what I want that's what I want  
So don't be sad when I'll be gone  
There's just one thing I hope you know I loved you so  
Cause I don't even care about the time  
I've got left here the only thing I know  
Now is that I wanna spend it with you with you nobody else here  
Tonight is gonna be the loneliest  
You'll be the saddest part of me  
A part of me that will never be mine  
It's obvious tonight is gonna be the loneliest  
You're still the oxygen I breathe  
I see your face when I close my eyes  
It's torturous tonight is gonna be the loneliest  
I'm sorry but I gotta go  
If you'll ever miss me give this song another go  
And I just keep on thinking  
How you made me feel better and all the crazy little  
Things that we did together  
In the end in the end  
It doesn't matter if tonight is gonna be the loneliest  
You'll be the saddest part of me  
A part of me that will never be mine  
It's obvious tonight is gonna be the loneliest  
You're still the oxygen I breathe  
I see your face when I close my eyes  
It's torturous tonight is gonna be the loneliest  
You'll be the saddest part of me  
A part of me that will never be mine  
It's obvious tonight is gonna be the loneliest  
You'll be the saddest part of me  
A part of me that will never be mine  
It's obvious tonight is gonna be the loneliest  
You're still the oxygen I breathe  
I see your face when I close my eyes  
It's torturous tonight is gonna be the loneliest
