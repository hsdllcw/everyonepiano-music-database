### Ooh La La歌词：

You don't have to look like a movie star  
Ooh I think you're good just the way you are  
Tell me if you could would you up and run away with me?

You don't have to roll like a millionaire  
Baby I would go with you anywhere  
We don't need no gold, we'll be shining anyway, we'll see

You know can't nobody get down like us  
We don't stop 'till we get enough  
C'mon, turn it up 'till the speakers pop  
Break it down, show me what you've got

Ooh my my baby don't be shy  
I see that spark flashing in your eye  
My heart beats fast 'cause I want it all  
So baby come with me and be my ooh la la

Take my hand, we can go all night  
And spin me round just the way I like  
It feels so good, I don't wanna stop  
So baby come with me and be my ooh la la

You don't have to wear no designer clothes  
Just as long as we're dancing on the floor  
Fingers in my hair and I'm letting go tonight, so free

You know can't nobody get down like us  
We don't stop 'till we get enough  
C'mon, turn it up 'till the speakers pop  
Break it down, show me what you've got

Ooh my my baby don't be shy  
I see that spark flashing in your eye  
My heart beats fast 'cause I want it all  
So baby come with me and be my ooh la la

Take my hand, we can go all night  
And spin me round just the way I like  
It feels so good, I don't wanna stop  
So baby come with me and be my ooh la la

[Break]

Ooh my my baby don't be shy  
I see that spark flashing in your eye

Ooh my my baby don't be shy  
I see that spark flashing in your eye  
My heart beats fast 'cause I want it all  
So baby come with me and be my ooh la la

Take my hand, we can go all night  
And spin me round just the way I like  
It feels so good, I don't wanna stop  
So baby come with me and be my ooh la la

Baby come with me and be my ooh la la  
So baby come with me and be my ooh la la
