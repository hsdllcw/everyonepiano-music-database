### Changes歌词：

Some days I move like water  
Some days I burn like fire  
Some days I wanna push further  
Some days I wanna do nothing  
And I just wanna be the best of me  
Even though sometimes we might disagree  
So that I can be the best for you ooh  
That's all I wanna do  
I'm going through changes  
I'm going through changes  
Though I'm going through changes  
Don't mean that I'll change  
Sometimes I'll go to sleep early  
Sometimes I can't close my eyes  
Sometimes I smile like it's all good  
Even though there's pain underneath it  
I just wanna be the best of me  
Even though sometimes I forget to breathe  
So that I can be the best for you ooh  
That's all I wanna do  
And I been going through changes  
I'm going through changes  
Though I'm going through changes  
Don't mean that I'll change  
Yeah I'm going through changes  
I'm going through changes  
Ooh yes I am  
Though I'm going through changes  
That's right  
Don't mean that I'll change woah  
La-da-da-da-dum la-da-da-da-dum  
La-da-da-da-dum la-da-da-da-dum no  
La-da-da-da-dum la-da-da-da-dum  
I'm going through changes  
No I ain't changed yeah  
Uh people change circumstances change  
But God always remains the same
