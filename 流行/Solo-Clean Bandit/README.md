在Clean Bandit联手Demi Lovato的新单 **Solo** 里，大家可以听到Clean
bandit擅长的电声编曲，错落有致的乐器排编和律动十足的鼓机，加之Demi lovato魅力十足的vocal和抓耳的副歌旋律，掀起了一轮夏日风暴。

歌曲一开场就非常俏皮，合成人声有节奏的重复唱词，还有之后魔性的"沃沃沃沃"，直抒胸臆地告诉了你这首歌将会非常欢快。很快，Demi用她温柔的声音滑进你的耳膜，让你沉浸在她的美妙世界。副歌前段，跃动的小鼓点加上清澈的吉他三连音时不时的划过，你的腰肢已经情不自禁地慢摇了吧。

随着Demi重复三遍而一遍比一遍感情更深的"no
more"响起，高潮如期而至。这个高潮部分，既抓耳又洗脑还中毒，这就是Clean的魔力，让Demi和合成人声交相辉映，而重复唱词的魅力就是能够瞬间让你缴械，完全沦陷。一般舞曲的副歌后段部分是制作人的炫技之地，在这里，Clean将他们的优势发挥得淋漓尽致，现代化的电子合成器加上传统的弦乐，谁说舞曲不能这么玩？一样震撼你的全身！

同时，网站还为大家提供了《[I Miss You](Music-9494-I-Miss-You-Clean-Bandit.html "I Miss
You")》的曲谱下载
