### Chloe (You're the One I Want)歌词：

[Wesley]  
Chloe, I know your sister turns everyone on  
But you're the one I want  
But you're the one I want, yeah, yeah

[Drew]  
Front page magazine  
Everybody says that she's a queen  
But that's you to me  
And I just want to let you know that  
She likes the flashing lights  
I love the way that you like candle light  
Stay close by my side  
I just want a chance to show that

[Keaton and Drew]  
(but you're the one I want)  
If only you could believe in yourself in the way I believe in you  
I-I do  
(but you're the one I want)  
If only you could see all of the beautiful things that I see in you  
It's true-oo-oo-oo

[All]  
Chloe, I know your sister turns everyone on  
But, oh, baby, I have no doubt you're the one that I want (ooh-ooh-oo)  
You think she's got it all but that don't make her better (ooh-ooh)  
You got my heart and that's the only thing that matters  
Chloe, I know your sister turns everyone on  
But you're the one I want  
But you're the one I want, yeah

[Drew]  
Fast lanes, limousines  
Baby, there can be no guarantees  
But if, you're with me, you know I can guarantee that  
Cause I'm attracted to your passion,  
Be yourself, forget the fashion  
Just keep that smile on your face  
You and I deserve to be forever ever lasting

[Keaton and Drew]  
If only you could believe in yourself in the way I believe in you  
I-I do (but you're the one I want)  
If only you could see all of the beautiful things that I see in you  
It's true-oo-oo-oo

[All]  
Chloe, I know your sister turns everyone on  
But, oh, baby, I have no doubt you're the one that I want (ooh-ooh-oo)  
You think she's got it all but that don't make her better  
You got my heart and that's the only thing that matters  
Chloe, I know your sister turns everyone on  
But you're the one I want, yeah  
But you're the one I want, yeah

[All]  
All you Chloe's,  
All you Chloe's  
They don't show you love enough (hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo)  
All you Chloe's  
You should know that you're my diamond in the rough  
It's true-oo-oo-oo

[All]  
Chloe, I know your sister turns everyone on  
But, oh, baby, I have no doubt you're the one that I want (ooh-ooh-oo)  
You think she's got it all but that don't make her better (ooh-ooh)  
You got my heart and that's the only thing that matters  
Chloe, I know your sister turns everyone on  
But you're the one I want  
But you're the one I want, yeah  
(ooh-ooh-oo)
