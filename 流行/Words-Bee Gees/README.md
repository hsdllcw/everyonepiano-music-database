### Words歌词：

Smile An Everlasting Smile  
A Smile Can Bring You Near To Me  
Don't Ever Let Me Find You Gone  
Cause That Would Bring A Tear To Me  
This World Has Lost Its Glory  
Let's Start A Brand New Now My Love  
Right Now There'll Be No Other Time  
And I Can Show You How My Love  
Talk In Everlasting Words  
And Dedicate Them All To Me  
And I Will Give You All My Life  
I'm Here If You Should Call To Me  
You Think That I Don't Even Mean  
You Think That I Don't Even Mean  
A Single Word I Say  
A Single Word I Say  
It's Only Words And Words Are All I Have  
It's Only Words And Words Are All I Have  
It's Only Words And Words Are All I Have  
It's Only Words And Words Are All I Have  
To Take Your Heart Away  
To Take Your Heart Away  
To Take Your Heart Away  
To Take Your Heart Away  
La La La La La...  
La La La La La...
