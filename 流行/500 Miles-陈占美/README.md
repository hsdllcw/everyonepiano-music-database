**500 Miles双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_500 Miles_ 由美国民谣歌手Hedy
West创作，并于1961年率先发行在民歌三重唱Journeymen(旅行者)的同名专辑中。这里是由陈占美演奏的钢琴曲版本。

迄今为止，如果beatles的《yesterday》是被翻唱次数最多的独唱歌曲的话，这首《500
miles》，则完全有可能是被翻唱次数最多的重唱歌曲。最为出名的就是Peter, Paul & Mary（三重唱组合）和The brothers
four（四重唱组合）的演绎，他们和Joan baez(代表作为那首著名的“donna
donna”)是美国60年代民歌运动的重要代表。他们歌曲的共同风格就是旋律优美，自然清新，同时又富有哲理，几十年来被人们传唱，经久不衰。

### 500 Miles歌词：

If you miss the train I'm on  
You will know that I am gone  
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles!  
A hundred miles  
A hundred miles  
A hundred miles  
A hundred miles  
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles!

Lord, I'm one, Lord, I'm two  
Lord, I'm three, Lord, I'm four  
Lord, I'm five hundred miles away from home!  
Away from home  
Away from home  
Away from home  
Away from home  
Lord, I'm five hundred miles away from home!

If my honey said so  
I'd railroad no more  
I'd sidetrack my engine and go home!  
And go home  
And go home  
And go home  
And go home  
I'd sidetrack my engine and go home!

Not a shirt on my back  
Not a penny to my name  
Lord, I can't make a living this a-way!  
This-a way  
This-a way  
This-a way  
This-a way  
Lord, I can't make a living this a-way!

Just as plain as I could tell her  
She'd better come along and go with me!  
Go with me  
Go with me  
Go with me  
Go with me  
She'd better come along and go with me!

My shoes are all worn  
My clothes are all torn  
Lord I can't go back home this a-way!  
This-a way  
This-a way  
This-a way  
This-a way  
Lord I can't go back home this a-way!

I told my little letter

If this train runs me right  
I'll be back tomorrow night  
I'm coming down the line on number nine!  
Number nine  
Number nine  
Number nine  
Number nine  
I'm coming down the line on number nine!

If you miss the train I'm on  
You will know that I am gone  
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles!  
A hundred miles  
A hundred miles  
A hundred miles  
A hundred miles  
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles!
