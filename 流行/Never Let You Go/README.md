### Never Let You Go歌词：

No I won't forget you  
Won't forget you  
Derulo  
I could see it in your eyes  
I'll only have you just for a time  
I'll believe your every lie  
Calling love a suicide  
And I fell for you it only took a minute  
Hopin' that the moment never finished  
We both know the truth  
When you leave I'm tryin' to forget it  
How am I supposed to go and live it  
Comparin' everybody to you  
No I won't forget you  
Won't forget you  
No I won't forget you  
Won't forget you  
No I won't forget you  
Won't forget you  
I will never let you go  
I won't forget about that  
I can't forget about that  
Diamonds fallin' down your face  
Tell me who you tryna replace  
'Cause it hurts so good to fill this space  
And nights like this I can't erase  
And I fell for you it only took a minute  
Hopin' that the moment never finished  
We both know the truth  
When you leave I'm tryin' to forget it  
How am I supposed to go and live it  
Comparin' everybody to you  
No I won't forget you  
Won't forget you  
No I won't forget you  
Won't forget you  
No I won't forget you  
Won't forget you  
I will never let you go  
I won't forget about that  
No I won't forget you  
Forget you  
Won't forget you  
I will never let you go
