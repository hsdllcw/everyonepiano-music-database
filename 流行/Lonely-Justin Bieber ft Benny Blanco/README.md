### Lonely歌词：

Everybody knows my name now  
But something 'bout it still feels strange  
Like looking in the mirror  
Tryna steady yourself and seeing somebody else  
And everything is not the same now  
It feels like all our lives have changed  
Maybe when I'm older it'll all calm down  
But it's killing me now  
What if you had it all but nobody to call  
Maybe then you'd know me  
'Cause I've had everything  
But no one's listening  
And that's just f**king lonely  
I'm so lo-o-o-onely  
Lo-o-o-onely  
Everybody knows my past now  
Like my house was always made of glass  
And maybe that's the price you pay  
For the money and fame at an early age  
And everybody saw me sick  
And it felt like no one gave a s**t  
They criticized the things I did  
As an idiot kid  
What if you had it all but nobody to call  
Maybe then you'd know me  
'Cause I've had everything  
But no one's listening  
And that's just f**king lonely  
I'm so lo-o-o-onely  
Lo-o-o-onely  
I'm so lo-o-o-onely  
Lo-o-o-onely
