### Tonight (I'm Lovin' You)歌词：

I know you want me  
I made it obvious that I want you too  
So put it on me  
Let's remove the space between me and you  
Now rock your body  
Damn I like the way that you move  
So give it to me, oh, oooohh...  
Cause I already know what you wanna do

Here's the situation  
Been to every nation  
Nobody's ever made me feel the way that you do  
You know my motivation  
Given my reputation  
Please excuse me I don't mean to be rude

But tonight I'm loving you  
Oh, you know  
That tonight I'm loving you  
Oh, you know  
That tonight I'm loving you  
Oh, you know  
That tonight I'm loving you  
Oh, you know

You're so damn pretty  
If I had a type then baby it would be you  
I know you're ready  
If I never lied then baby you'd be the truth

Here's the situation  
Been to every nation  
Nobody's ever made me feel the way that you do  
You know my motivation  
Given my reputation  
Please excuse me I don't mean to be rude

But tonight I'm loving you  
Oh, you know  
That tonight I'm loving you  
Oh, you know  
That tonight I'm loving you  
Oh, you know  
That tonight I'm loving you  
Oh, you know

[Ludacris]  
LUDA...  
Tonight I'm gonna do  
Everything that I want with you  
Everythin' that you need  
Everything that you want  
I wanna honey  
I wanna stunt with you  
From the window  
To the wall  
Gonna give you, my all  
Winter n summertime  
When I get you on the springs  
I'mma make you fall  
You got that body  
That make me wanna get up on the floor  
Just to see you dance  
And I love the way you shake that ass  
Turn around and let me see them pants  
You stuck with me  
I'm stuck with you  
Let's find something to do  
(Please) excuse me  
I don't mean to be rude

But tonight I'm loving you  
Oh, you know  
That tonight I'm loving you  
Oh, you know  
That tonight I'm loving you  
Oh, you know  
That tonight I'm loving you  
Oh, you know  
That tonight I'm loving you

That tonight I'm loving you  
Yeah
