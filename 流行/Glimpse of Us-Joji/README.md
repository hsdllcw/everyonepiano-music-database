88rising旗下签约歌手Joji于2022年6月10日美东时间中午12点发行新单曲《 **Glimpse of Us**
》，这也是Joji自2020年发布 “Nectar”（获得 RIAA 认证的黄金专辑 ）以来的首支单曲。

这首由 Connor McDonough（Jason Derulo、Tinashe、The Jonas
Brothers）制作的钢琴民谣，诉说了对于过往爱情的温柔回忆，也预示着这位难以捉摸的艺术家的声音曲线转向了更为成熟的一面。同步发行的还有一部略显混乱的MV，与歌曲的柔情形成鲜明对比。

同时，网站还为大家提供了《[ **Yeah Right-Joji**](Music-9338.html "Yeah Right-Joji")》曲谱下载

### Glimpse of Us歌词：

She'd take the world off my shoulders  
If it was ever hard to move  
She'd turn the rain to a rainbow  
When I was living in the blue  
Why then if she is so perfect  
Do I still wish that it was you  
Perfect don't mean that it's working  
So what can I do  
When you're out of sight  
In my mind  
Cause sometimes  
I look in her eyes and  
That's where I find  
A glimpse of us  
And I try  
To fall for her touch  
But I'm thinking of  
The way it was  
Said I'm fine  
And said I moved on  
I'm only here passing time in her arms  
Hoping I'll find  
A glimpse of us  
Tell me he savors your glory  
Does he laugh the way I did  
Is this a part of your story  
One that I had never lived  
Maybe one day you'll feel lonely  
And in his eyes you'll get a glimpse  
Maybe you'll start slipping slowly  
And find me again  
When you're out of sight  
In my mind  
Cause sometimes  
I look in her eyes and  
That's where I find  
A glimpse of us  
And I try  
To fall for her touch  
But I'm thinking of  
The way it was  
Said I'm fine  
And said I moved on  
I'm only here passing time in her arms  
Hoping I'll find  
A glimpse of us  
Oooh  
Oooh-ooh-ooh  
Oooh  
Oooh-oooh-oooh-ooh-ooh  
Cause sometimes  
I look in her eyes and  
That's where I find  
A glimpse of us  
And I try  
To fall for her touch  
But I'm thinking of  
The way it was  
Said I'm fine  
And said I moved on  
I'm only here passing time in her arms  
Hoping I'll find  
A glimpse of us
