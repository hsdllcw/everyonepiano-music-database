### Down by the River歌词：

Down by the river, I was drawn by your grace  
Into tempest of oblivion and to the lovers-place  
I was stuck in a puddle, full of tears and unwise  
Dark doings now I know, that we've paid unlike

Honey I know, hey when we walked arm in arm  
I felt like we can throw away the falseness of our past  
And I know too it''s been the hardest days for you  
Let''s throw them out the window  
That's what those lovers do

Down by the river, I was drawn by your grace  
Into tempest of oblivion and to the lovers-place  
I was stuck in a puddle, full of tears and unwise  
Dark doings now I know, that we've paid unlike

Honey I know, hey when we walked arm in arm  
I felt like we can throw away the falseness of our past  
And I know too it''s been the hardest days for you  
Let''s throw them out the window  
That's what those lovers do

Ooh, down by river  
Ooh, down by river  
Ooh, down by river  
Ooh, down by river

Down by the river, I was drawn by your grace  
Into tempest of oblivion and to the lovers-place  
I was stuck in a puddle, full of tears and unwise  
Dark doings now I know, that we've paid unlike

Honey I know, hey when we walked arm in arm  
I felt like we can throw away the falseness of our past  
And I know too it''s been the hardest days for you  
Let''s throw them out the window  
That's what those lovers do

Ooh, ooh  
Ooh, ooh  
Ooh, ooh  
Ooh, ooh
