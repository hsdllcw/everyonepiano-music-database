**You Raise Me Up** 是美国著名歌唱家Josh Groban所翻唱的一首歌曲。

_  
You Raise Me Up_
这首歌是一首赞美诗，事实上是歌颂上帝，告诫人们在任何艰难压抑的情况下，靠着上帝胜过自己、胜过环境的“福音类”的歌。间奏的风笛更是让人深陷音乐深海之中无法自拔，作为少有的励志和感恩音乐，最后的合唱气势磅礴，坚定有力。其中有一句You
raise me up, to walk on stormy seas，是从《圣经》的典故而来----
耶稣走在海面上。中文意思简单可翻译为“是你鼓舞了我”，原唱是New Age Music乐队Secret Garden（神秘园），被多次翻唱。

### You Raise Me Up歌词：

When I am down and, oh, my soul, so weary;  
When troubles come and my heart burdened be;  
Then I am still and wait here in the silence,  
Until you come and sit awhile with me.

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;  
You raise me up to walk on stormy seas;  
I am strong when I am on your shoulders;  
You raise me up to more than I can be.

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;  
You raise me up to walk on stormy seas;  
I am strong when I am on your shoulders;  
You raise me up to more than I can be.

There is no life - no life without its hunger;  
Each restless heart beats so imperfectly;  
But when you come and I am filled with wonder,  
Sometimes, I think I glimpse eternity.

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;  
You raise me up to walk on stormy seas;  
I am strong when I am on your shoulders;  
You raise me up to more than I can be.

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;  
You raise me up to walk on stormy seas;  
I am strong when I am on your shoulders;  
You raise me up to more than I can be.

You raise me up to more than I can be.
