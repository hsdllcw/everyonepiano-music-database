### Ew歌词：

When it's lovely  
I believe in anything  
What does love mean  
When the end is rolling in  
Let it go  
Let it stay  
Can we love one another  
Cold is it safe to be warm in the summer  
Who knows  
I said who knows  
Oooh teach me to love just to let me go  
I can't believe that I'm not enough  
Not enough  
And so long no one will be here to save you  
And no one will be here to let you know  
Let you know  
This is your world this is your world  
This is your world this is your world  
Quietly still  
In a lie  
Oh goodnight  
I don't mind  
Oooh teach me to love just to let me go  
I can't believe that I'm not enough  
Not enough  
And so long no one will be here to save you  
And no one will be here to let you know  
Let you know
