### Worldwide歌词：

Wait a minute  
Before you tell me anything how was your day  
Cuz I  
Been missing you by my side  
Did I awake you outta your dreams  
I'm sorry but I couldn't sleep  
You calm me down  
Theres something bout the sound of your voice  
I'm never, never  
Never as far away as it may seem  
Soon we'll be together  
We'll pick up right where we left off

Yeah its fun in tokyo  
Its just one thing that I gotta do  
Tuck you in every night on the phone  
And I can only take another good bye  
Baby wont be long  
And you're the one that i'm waiting on  
Tuck you in every night on the phone  
And I been thinking bout you worldwide  
Worldwide worldwide  
Girl I been thinking about you worldwide  
Worldwide worldwide  
Girl I been thinking about you

Yes I may  
Meet a million pretty girls that know my name  
But don't you worry  
Cuz you have my heart  
It ain't easy  
To keep it movin city to city  
Just get up and go  
The show must go on  
So I need you to be strong

I'm never, never  
Never as far away as it may seem  
Soon we'll be together  
We'll pick up right where we left off

Yeah its fun in tokyo  
Its just one thing that I gotta do  
Tuck you in every night on the phone  
And I can only take another good bye  
Baby wont be long  
And you're the one that i'm waiting on  
Tuck you in every night on the phone  
And I been thinking bout you worldwide  
Worldwide worldwide  
Girl I been thinking about you worldwide  
Worldwide worldwide  
Girl I been thinking about you

Wherever the wind blows me  
You're stil the one and only  
Girl on my mind  
There ain't no one better  
So always remember  
Always remember  
Girl you're mine

Yeah its fun in tokyo  
Its just one thing that I gotta do  
Tuck you in every night on the phone  
And I can only take another good bye  
Baby wont be long  
And you're the one im waiting on  
Tuck you in every night on the phone  
And I been thinking bout you worldwide
