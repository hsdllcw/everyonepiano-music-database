**Get Me双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Get Me_ 是Justin
Bieber与R&B才女Kehlani合作的单曲。全曲迷幻的R&B氛围像极了Journals时期的Justin，看来这次的新专他是决心向R&B转型了。Justin慵懒撩人的声音和Kehlani颇具辨识度的嗓音完美match，后面的几个高音又有Purpose时期的味道。
R&B总是能带给人更强烈的沉浸感的，歌词里写的缠绵情愫弥漫在每一个重低音节拍中，这样的风格更耐听，更需要细品。

### Get Me歌词：

Justin Bieber：  
Ooh you don't compare don't fit in with 'em do you get me

Justin Bieber：  
See you're lookin' beyond the surface  
Can tell by the questions you're asking  
You got me low-key nervous  
It feels like we're on the same wave yeah  
Never intended to relate I mean what are the chances  
Never thought I'd connect with you not any circumstances

Like you came inside you're finishin' my sentences  
And they're sayin' no we can't deny this energy  
How 'bout reapin' all the benefits yeah
