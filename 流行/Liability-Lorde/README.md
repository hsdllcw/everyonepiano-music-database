### Liability歌词：

One, two

Baby really hurt me  
Crying in the taxi  
He don't wanna know me  
Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm  
Says it was poison  
So I guess I'll go home  
Into the arms of the girl that I love  
The only love I haven't screwed up  
She's so hard to please  
But she's a forest fire  
I do my best to meet her demands  
Play at romance, we slow dance  
In the living room, but all that a stranger would see  
Is one girl swaying alone  
Stroking her cheek

They say, "You're a little much for me  
You're a liability  
You're a little much for me"  
So they pull back, make other plans  
I understand, I'm a liability  
Get you wild, make you leave  
I'm a little much for  
E-a-na-na-na, everyone

The truth is I am a toy  
That people enjoy  
'Til all of the tricks don't work anymore  
And then they are bored of me  
I know that it's exciting  
Running through the night, but  
Every perfect summer's  
Eating me alive until you're gone  
Better on my own

They say, "You're a little much for me  
You're a liability  
You're a little much for me"  
So they pull back, make other plans  
I understand, I'm a liability  
Get you wild, make you leave  
I'm a little much for  
E-a-na-na-na, everyone

They're gonna watch me  
Disappear into the sun  
You're all gonna watch me  
Disappear into the sun
