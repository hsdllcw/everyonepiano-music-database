**People Help the People** 是英国创作型歌手Birdy的一首翻唱歌曲。贾斯敏•范•登•博加尔德（Jasmine Van den
Bogaerde)，以艺名Birdy为人所知，生于英国。2008年，她以十二岁之龄赢得Open Mic UK音乐竞赛冠军，因而成名。

  
她的首支单曲Skinny Love，翻唱自Bon
Iver。2011年11月7日，Birdy发布了其同名专辑《Birdy》。2013年9月23日，她的第二张录音室专辑《Fire

### People Help the People歌词：

God knows what is hiding in those weak and drunken hearts  
Guess he kissed the girls and made them cry  
Those hard-faced queens of misadventure  
God knows what is hiding in those weak and sunken lives  
Fiery throngs of muted angels  
Giving love but getting nothing back, oh

People help the people  
And if you're homesick  
give me your hand and I'll hold it  
People help the people  
And nothing will drag you down  
Oh and if I had a brain,  
Oh and if I had a brain  
I'd be cold as a stone and rich as a fool  
That turned all those good hearts away

God knows what is hiding in this world of little consequence  
Behind the tears, inside the lies  
A thousand slowly dying sunsets  
God knows what is hiding in those weak and drunken hearts  
Guess the loneliness came knocking  
No one needs to be alone, oh singin'

People help the people  
And if you're homesick,  
give me your hand and I'll hold it  
People help the people  
Nothing will drag you down  
Oh and if I had a brain,  
Oh and if I had a brain  
I'd be cold as a stone and rich as a fool  
That turned all those good hearts away

Nah naaah nah nah naaaaahhhhhh oooouuuu  
Nah naaah nah nah naaaaahhhhhh oooouuuu

People help the people  
And if you're homesick,  
give me your hand and I'll hold it  
People help the people  
Nothing will drag you down  
Oh and if I had a brain,  
Oh and if I had a brain  
I'd be cold as a stone and rich as a fool  
That turned all those good hearts away
