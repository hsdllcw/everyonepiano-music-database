### Cheers (Drink to That)歌词：

Cheers to the freakin' weekend  
I drink to that, yeah yeah  
Oh let the Jameson sink in  
I drink to that, yeah yeah  
Don't let the bastards get ya down  
Turn it around with another round  
There's a party at the bar everybody put your glasses up and I drink to that  
I drink to that.

Life's too short to be sittin' round miserable  
People gon' talk whether you doing bad or good, yeah  
Got a drink on my mind and my mind on my money, yeah  
Looking so bomb, gonna find me a honey  
Got my Ray-Bans on and I'm feelin' hella cool tonight, yeah  
Everybody's vibin' so don't nobody start a fight, yeah-ah-ah-ah

Cheers to the freakin' weekend  
I drink to that, yeah yeah  
Oh, let the Jameson sink in  
I drink to that, yeah yeah  
Don't let the bastards get ya down  
Turn it around with another round  
There's a party at the bar everybody put your glasses up and I drink to that  
I drink to that.

'Bout to hop on the bar, put it all on my card tonight, yeah.

Might be mad in the morning but you know we goin' hard tonight  
It's getting coyote ugly up in here, no tyra  
It's only up from here, no downward spiral  
Got my Ray-Bans on and I'm feelin' hella cool tonight, yeah  
Everybody's vibin' so don't nobody start a fight, yeah

Cheers to the freakin' weekend  
I drink to that, yeah yeah  
Oh let the Jameson sink in  
I drink to that, yeah yeah  
Don't let the bastards get ya down  
Turn it around with another round  
There's a party at the bar everybody put your glasses up and I drink to that  
I drink to that.

Cheers to the freakin weekend  
I drink to that, yeah yeah  
Oh let the Jameson sink in  
I drink to that, yeah yeah  
Don't let the bastards get ya down  
Turn it around with another round  
There's a party at the bar everybody put your glasses up and I drink to that  
I drink to that.  
And I drink to that.  
I drink to that.  
And I drink to that.
