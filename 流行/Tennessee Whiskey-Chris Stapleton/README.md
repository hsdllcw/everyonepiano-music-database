### Tennessee Whiskey歌词：

Used to spend my nights out in a bar room  
Liquor was the only love I've known  
But you rescued me from reaching  
For the bottle  
And you brought me back from  
Being too far gone  
You're as smooth as tennessee whiskey  
You're as sweet as strawberry wine  
You're as warm as a glass of brandy  
And I stay stoned on your love all the time  
I looked for love in all the same old places  
Found the bottom of the bottle always dry  
But when you poured out your heart  
I didn't waste it  
Cause there nothing like your love  
To get me high  
You're as smooth as tennessee whiskey  
You're as sweet as strawberry wine  
You're as warm as a glass of brandy  
And I stay stoned on your love all the time  
You're as smooth as tennessee whiskey  
You're as sweet as strawberry wine  
You're as warm as a glass of brandy  
And I stay stoned on your love all the time  
You're as smooth as tennessee whiskey  
As tennessee whiskey  
As tennessee whiskey  
You're as smooth as tennessee whiskey  
As tennessee whiskey  
As tennessee whiskey
