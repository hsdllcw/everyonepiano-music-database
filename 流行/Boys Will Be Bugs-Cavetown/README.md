### Boys Will Be Bugs歌词：

Yes I  
I'm a dumb teen boy  
I eat sticks and rocks and mud  
I don't care about the government  
And I really need a hug  
I feel stupid stupid  
Ugly ugly  
Pretend it doesn't bother me  
I'm not very strong but  
I'll f**k you up if you're mean to bugs  
It's getting cold down here underneath the weather  
I skipped class to sit with you  
I really like your spotty sweater if  
Ladybugs are girls  
How do you make kids together  
What's it like in a female world  
I bet it's just so much better  
I just turned fourteen  
And I think this year I'm gonna be mean  
Don't mess with me I'm a big boy now  
And I'm very scary  
I punch my walls stay out at night and I do karate  
Don't message me 'cause I won't reply  
I wanna make you cry  
Ain't that how it's s'posed to be  
Though it isn't me  
Boys will be bugs right  
Boys will be bugs right  
I'm a dumb teen boy  
All I wanna do is quit  
My mum told me that she's worried  
And I couldn't give a s**t  
I have friends who understand me  
Their names are spider beetle bee  
They don't say much but  
They have always listened to me  
The other boys at school  
Think it's cool to hate your parents  
But they're lying all the time  
The bugs advised that I should let 'em  
And if you wanna cry  
Make sure that they never see it  
Or even better yet  
Block it out and never feel it  
I just turned fourteen  
And I think I know everything  
Don't mess with me I'm a big boy now  
And I'm very scary  
I punch my walls stay out at night  
And I do karate  
Don't message me 'cause I won't reply  
I wanna make you cry  
Ain't that how it's s'posed to be  
Though it isn't me  
Boys will be bugs right  
Just turned fourteen  
And I think this year I'm gonna be mean  
Just turned fourteen and I think I know everything  
Just turned fourteen  
And I think I know everything  
Just turned fourteen  
And I think the world revolves around me  
Don't mess with me I'm a big boy now  
And I'm very scary  
I punch my walls stay out at night and I do karate  
Don't message me 'cause I won't reply  
I wanna make you cry  
Ain't that how it's s'posed to be  
Though it isn't me  
Boys will be bugs right  
Boys will be bugs right
