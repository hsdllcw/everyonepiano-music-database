**Ready For It双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Ready For It_ 是美国流行女歌手Taylor
Swift（泰勒•斯威夫特）演唱的一首歌曲。词曲由泰勒•斯威夫特、马克斯•马丁、希尔贝克和阿里•帕亚米合作编写，后三位负责音乐制作。歌曲收录在泰勒•斯威夫特的第六张录音室专辑《Reputation》中为开场曲，后作为其所属专辑的首支宣传单曲，于2017年9月3日通过大机器唱片公司发行。《...Ready
for It？》首周空降Billboard榜第4名，在宣传歌曲中算取得非常好的成绩。

三连音重轰鸣力量感爆棚，主歌节奏，鼓点bass刚刚好，拳拳到肉，副歌旋律也非常抓耳，歌曲大体是HIPPOP骨架，总体的体量感已经往大格局走了。至于我的感受，只有“惊艳”二字能形容，这还只是宣传单，能把自己的首单《Look
What You Made Me Do》挤到第二的这种事儿，只有我霉能干得出来。期待接下来的歌曲。

### Ready For It歌词：

Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him  
Wonder how many girls he had loved and left haunted  
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom  
Holdin' him for ransom  
Some, some boys are tryin' too hard  
He don't try at all, though  
Younger than my exes but he act like such a man, so  
I see nothing better, I keep him forever  
Like a vendetta-ta  
I-I-I see how this is gon' go  
Touch me and you'll never be alone  
I-Island breeze and lights down low  
No one has to know  
In the middle of the night, in my dreams  
You should see the things we do, baby  
In the middle of the night, in my dreams  
I know I'm gonna be with you  
So I take my time  
Are you ready for it?  
Me, I was a robber first time that he saw me  
Stealing hearts and running off and never saying sorry  
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist  
And we'll move to an island-and  
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor  
Every lover known in comparison is a failure  
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now  
Never be the same now, now  
I-I-I see how this is gon' go  
Touch me and you'll never be alone  
I-Island breeze and lights down low  
No one has to know  
(No one has to know)  
In the middle of the night, in my dreams  
You should see the things we do, baby  
In the middle of the night in my dreams  
I know I'm gonna be with you  
So I take my time  
Are you ready for it?  
Ooh, are you ready for it?  
Baby, let the games begin  
Let the games begin  
Let the games begin  
Baby, let the games begin  
Let the games begin  
Let the games begin  
I-I-I see how this is gon' go  
Touch me and you'll never be alone  
I-Island breeze and lights down low  
No one has to know  
In the middle of the night, in my dreams  
You should see the things we do, baby  
In the middle of the night, in my dreams  
I know I'm gonna be with you  
So I take my time  
In the middle of the night  
Baby, let the games begin  
Let the games begin  
Let the games begin  
Are you ready for it?  
Baby, let the games begin  
Let the games begin  
Let the games begin  
Are you ready for it?
