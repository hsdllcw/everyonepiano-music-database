Mars不愧是格莱美大奖的收割机，真的是让人又爱又恨。恨的是，为什么要让大家如此痴醉在他的声音里，果然太可恶！爱的是，他那俏皮的嗓音与乖巧可爱的身高。不得不让人折服！

### Wake Up in the Sky歌词：

Bruno Mars/Gucci Mane：  
Fly fly fly  
It's Gucci it's Gucci  
Huh  
Fly  
I drink till I'm drunk yeah smoke till I'm high yeah  
Castle on the hill well damn wake up in the sky  
You can't tell me I ain't fly you can't tell me I ain't fly  
I know I'm super fly I know I know I'm super fly I know  
The ladies love in luxury yeah  
That's why they all f**k with me woo  
Out here with the moves yeesh like I invented smooth  
You can't tell me I ain't fly you can't tell me I ain't fly  
I know I'm super fly I know I know I'm super fly  
Gucci Mane：  
Huh huh huh  
I stay fresh as hell take a pic I might as well hell  
Drop the top and take a selfie my car drives itself  
I got white girls blushin' homie college girls rushin' on me woo  
All my diamonds custom so they clutchin' and they touchin' on me  
Ooo pick his vegetables  
Ooo that kid's edible  
Ooo it's incredible  
Ooo ooo ooo  
I smell like Bond Number 9 nine  
Section full of foreign dimes  
B***h is starin' at me sayin'  
Wow  
Unforgettable like Nat King Cole  
Gucci Barry White I'm singing to your ho well damn  
Her one night show  
A human bank roll whoa  
She lost in the sauce  
'Cause Gucci got the glow huh  
Bruno Mars/Gucci Mane：

Big Cuban link don't need no pendant  
I ain't never had no pot to piss in yeah  
Now all my records trendin'  
Oh my I came from stealing bikes to flying on a G5  
I don't know why I been smokin' this Cherry Pie so much  
But this my life  
I'm on adderall I be smellin' Hi-Tec when I piss  
Like it's basketball I drop 50-pointer on my wrist  
It's Lil Kodak take a pic  
I came home to drop the heat  
All these diamonds got me sick  
I'm actin' spoiled  
Cutlass sittin' high I feel like I can fly  
So fresh to death it's crazy I feel like I can die  
I done finally got my wings they make me wanna sing glee  
Bruno Mars/Kodak Black：  
I drink till I'm drunk till I'm drunk  
Smoke till I'm high till I'm high  
Castle on the hill ayy wake up in the sky  
You can't tell me I ain't fly you can't tell me I ain't fly baby  
I know I'm super fly I know it
