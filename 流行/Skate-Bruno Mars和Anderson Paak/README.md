**Skate** 是Bruno Mars、Anderson .Paak、Silk Sonic演唱的歌曲，收录在Silk
Sonic即将发行的首张录音室专辑An Evening with Silk Sonic中。

此曲超级好听。前奏就很吸引人，且给人一种不稳定的感觉，仿佛想呈现出男生对女生热烈而急切的追求。勾人电吉他撩拨心弦，仿佛能感受到男生那颗渴望而又躁动的心；弦乐更是灵巧地衬托出了这首歌的情绪，尤其在过门处的表现非常精彩，仿佛为这首歌上了一层金边。主旋律的编写仍然沿用了之前的方法。总之，听此曲给人一种听音乐剧的感觉，太赞了！

### Skate歌词：

Oh my  
Oh my  
In a room full of dimes you would be 100 dollars  
If being fine was a crime  
Girl they'd lock your lil' fine a*s up in a tower  
The way you move like you do  
Ooh it's like you do it for a livin'  
Do a lil' spin do it again sshhiiiii  
Look like you playin' for the win  
Oh baby  
I'm tryna roll I'm tryna ride  
I'm tryna float I'm tryna glide  
No no don't be shy  
Just take my hand and hold on tight  
Oh skate to me baby  
Skate  
Slide your way on over  
Slide your way on over  
Skate to me baby  
Skate  
I wanna get to know ya  
I wanna get to know ya  
Come on  
Oh my  
Oh my  
Got your hair in the wind and your skin glistening  
I can smell your sweet perfume  
Mmmm ya smell better than a barbecue  
Oh superstar is what you are  
I'm your biggest fan  
If you're lookin' for a man suga here I am  
I'm tryna roll I'm tryna ride  
I'm tryna roll with you darling  
I'm tryna float I'm tryna glide  
Oh no no don't be shy  
Just take my hand and hold on tight  
Oh skate to me baby  
Skate  
Slide your way on over  
Slide your way on over  
Skate to me baby  
Skate  
I I wanna get to know ya  
I wanna get to know ya  
I never fall but tonight you got me falling for you  
And only you you  
I'm reaching out in hopes that you reach for me too  
Girl let's groove  
Girl you got me singing ooooooohhhh  
My oh my

Oh skate to me baby

Slide your way on over
