### Empty Love歌词：

All my friends are faded faded  
One of them's half naked naked  
That's when I really start to hate it  
Can't make it 'til three  
Then a guy starts asking  
To get my number on a napkin  
Thinking something's gonna happen  
I'm laughing boy please  
That's why I-I-I  
Yeah I always end up outside  
Feeling like I'm wasting my time my time  
Oh oh  
I-I-I-I can't do it anymore yeah I've tried  
Looking for what I thought I'd find  
Don't want no empty love  
Oh oh  
Oh oh  
Like oh  
Oh oh  
I'm just walking around in a baseball T  
Don't want no empty love  
Same girls as last night  
Yeah they getting in a girl fight  
Boys think it's so tight yeah right  
Let's leave  
I don't know what they're chill with  
All the drinks keep spilling  
And I can still feel them all over me  
That's why I-I-I  
Yeah I always end up outside  
Feeling like I'm wasting my time my time oh oh  
I-I-I-I can't do it anymore yeah I've tried  
Looking for what I thought I'd find I'd find  
All the girls in the club like omg  
All the boys in the club like who is she  
All we want here is love but it's so empty  
Like oh  
All the girls in the club like buy me a drink  
All the boys in the club they're starting to stink  
I'm just walking around in a baseball T  
Don't want no empty love  
Oh oh  
Oh oh  
Like oh  
Oh oh  
I'm just walking around in a baseball T  
Don't want no empty love  
Oh oh  
Oh oh  
Oh oh  
Don't want no empty love  
Oh oh  
Oh oh  
Oh oh  
Don't want no empty love  
Love
