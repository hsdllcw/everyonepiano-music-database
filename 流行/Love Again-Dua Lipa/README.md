### Love Again歌词：

I never thought that I would find a way out  
I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud  
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore  
But God d**n you got me in love again  
I used to think that I was made out of stone  
I used to spend so many nights on my own  
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore  
But God d**n you got me in love again  
Show me that Heaven's right here baby  
Touch me so I know I'm not crazy  
Never have I ever met somebody like you  
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do  
But God d**n you got me in love again  
You got me in love again  
You got me in love again  
You got me in love again  
Again  
So many nights my tears fell harder than rain  
Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave  
I'd rather die than have to live in a storm like before  
But God d**n you got me in love again  
Show me that Heaven's right here baby  
Touch me so I know I'm not crazy  
Never have I ever met somebody like you  
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do  
But God d**n you got me in love again  
You got me in love again  
You got me in love again  
You got me in love again  
Again  
I can't believe I can't believe I finally found someone  
I'll sink my teeth in disbelief cos you're the one that I want  
I can't believe I can't believe I'm not afraid anymore  
But God d**n you got me in love again  
I never thought that I would find a way out  
I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud  
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore  
But God d**n you got me in love again  
I can't believe I can't believe I finally found someone  
I'll sink my teeth in disbelief cos you're the one that I want  
I can't believe there's something left inside my chest anymore  
But God d**n you got me in love again  
You got me in love again  
You got me in love again  
You got me in love again  
And again and again and again and again
