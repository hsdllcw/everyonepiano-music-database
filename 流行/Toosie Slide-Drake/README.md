_Toosie Slide_
是流行天王Drake的新歌。紧促抓耳的鼓点加上Drake独特磁性的hook，跟《god'plan》一样抓耳的副歌旋律。歌词非常洗脑，Drake说自己的舞蹈媲美Michael
Jackson，MV里的舞步真的是独领风骚！

### Toosie Slide歌词：

Black leather glove no sequins  
Buckles on the jacket it's Alyx s**t  
Nike crossbody got a piece in it  
Got a dance but it's really on some street s**t  
I'ma show you how to get it  
It go right foot up left foot slide  
Left foot up right foot slide  
Basically I'm sayin' either way we 'bout to slide ayy  
Can't let this one slide ayy  
Don't you want to dance with me  
No I could dance like Michael Jackson  
I could give you thug passion  
It's a thriller in the trap where we from  
Baby don't you want to dance with me  
No I could dance like Michael Jackson  
I could give you satisfaction  
And you know we out here every day with it  
I'ma show you how to get it  
It go right foot up left foot slide  
Left foot up right foot slide  
Basically I'm sayin' either way we 'bout to slide ayy  
Can't let this one slide ayy  
Who's babe  
Two thousand shorties wanna tie the knot ayy yeah  
Two hundred shooters on my brother's block woah yeah  
Petal off the rose like I love her not maybe not  
I don't know what's wrong with me I can't stop woah yeah  
Won't stop woah yeah never stop  
Got so many opps I be mistakin' opps for other opps  
Got so many people that I love out of troubled spots  
Other than the family I got it's either you or me  
That's just how I think it's either you or me  
This life got too deep for you baby  
Two or three of us about to creep where they stayin'  
Black leather glove no sequins  
Buckles on the jacket it's Alyx s**t  
Nike crossbody got a piece in it  
Got a dance but it's really on some street s**t  
I'ma show you how to get it  
It go right foot up left foot slide  
Left foot up right foot slide  
Basically I'm sayin' either way we 'bout to slide ayy  
Can't let this one slide ayy  
Who's babe  
Toosie slide then I hit it double time  
Then I hit a spin 'cause we spun their block a couple times  
If it's not the right time there'll always be another time  
I'm not even trippin' we'll just see 'em in the summertime woah yeah  
Can't describe the pressure I be puttin' on myself yeah  
Really I just can't afford to lose nobody else yeah  
If they movin' shaky we'll just do this s**t ourselves woah  
If I'm movin' shaky Chubbs'll do this s**t himself yeah  
Solo n***as only YOLO for real  
Heard a lot about ya but we don't know for real  
Next time guarantee the truth'll get revealed  
Black leather glove no sequins

Basically I'm sayin' either way we 'bout to slide ayy
