### None Of My Business歌词：

D**n I heard that you and her been having problems  
She likes to fight I guess you both have that in common  
Started at the top and now you at the bottom  
But baby this is none of my business  
You moved on that a wrong been a while baby  
So did I so did I so did I  
Took her home to your mom  
Oh but trust me that ain't on my mind  
On my mind on my mind on my mind  
I I I I I I I I  
I saw on my feed  
She looks a little like me  
I I I I I I I I  
I can't help but see  
It's not jealousy no  
D**n I heard that you and her been having problems  
She likes to fight I guess you both have that in common  
Started at the top and now you at the bottom  
But baby this is none of my business  
D**n I heard that you and her been having issues  
I wish you the best I hope that she can fix you  
You'll be calling me the second that it hits you  
But baby this is none of my business  
Does she care  
Wear her hair up  
The way that babe you always liked always liked always liked  
When you're alone does she know  
All the ways to treat your body right right yeah  
I I I I I I I I  
I saw on my feed  
She looks a little like me  
I I I I I I I I  
I can't help but see  
It's not jealousy no  
D**n I heard that you and her been having problems  
She likes to fight I guess you both have that in common  
Started at the top and now you at the bottom  
But baby this is none of my business  
D**n I heard that you and her been having issues  
I wish you the best I hope that she can fix you  
You'll be calling me the second that it hits you  
But baby this is none of my business  
None of my business no to the no ah  
Haven't watched your story in four days  
Least not today  
'Cause it's none of my business  
None of my business  
D**n I heard that you and her been having problems  
She likes to fight I guess you both have that in common  
Started at the top and now you at the bottom  
But baby this is none of my business yeah  
D**n I heard that you and her been having issues oh  
I wish you the best I hope that she can fix you you you  
You'll be calling me the second that it hits you  
But baby this is none of my business
