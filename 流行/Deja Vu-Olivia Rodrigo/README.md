### Deja Vu歌词：

Car rides to Malibu  
Strawberry ice cream one spoon for two  
And trading jackets  
Laughing 'bout how small it looks on you  
Ah-ha-ha-ha  
Watching reruns of Glee  
Bein' annoying singing in harmony  
I bet she's braggin' to all her friends  
Saying you're so unique  
Huh  
So when you gonna tell her  
That we did that too  
She thinks it's special  
But it's all re-used  
That was our place I found it first  
I made the jokes you tell to her  
When she's with you  
Do you get deja vu when she's with you  
Do you get deja vu hmm  
Ha  
Do you get deja vu huh  
Do you call her almost say my name  
'Cause let's be honest we kinda do sound the same  
Another actress I hate to think that I was just your type  
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel  
'Cause you played her "Uptown Girl"  
You're singing it together  
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her  
In between the chorus and the verse  
So when you gonna tell her  
That we did that too  
She thinks it's special  
But it's all re-used  
That was the show we talked about  
Played you the songs she's singing now  
When she's with you  
Do you get deja vu when she's with you  
Do you get deja vu  
Huh  
Do you get deja vu  
Strawberry ice cream in Malibu  
Don't act like we didn't do that s**t too  
You're trading jackets like we used to do  
Yeah everything is all re-used  
Play her piano but she doesn't know  
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel  
A different girl now but there's nothing new  
I know you get deja vu  
I know you get deja vu  
I know you get deja vu
