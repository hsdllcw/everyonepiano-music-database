### Shot Me Down歌词：

I was five and he was six  
We rode on horses made of sticks  
He wore black and I wore white  
He would always win the fight

Bang bang, he shot me down  
Bang bang, I hit the ground  
Bang bang, that awful sound  
Bang bang, my baby shot me down

Seasons came and changed the time  
When I grew up I called him mine  
He would always laugh and say  
Remember when we used to play

Bang bang, I shot you down  
Bang bang, you hit the ground  
Bang bang, that awful sound  
Bang bang, I used to shoot you down

Music played and people sang  
Just for me the church bells rang

Now he's gone I don't know why  
Until this day, sometimes I cry  
He didn't even say goodbye  
He didn't take the time to lie

Bang bang, he shot me down  
Bang bang, I hit the ground  
Bang bang, that awful sound  
Bang bang, my baby shot me down
