### Masterpiece歌词：

So much pressure  
Why so loud?  
If you don't like my sound  
You can turn it down

I got a road  
And I walk it alone

Uphill battle  
I look good when I climb  
I'm ferocious, precocious  
I get braggadocios

I'm not gonna stop  
I like the view from the top (Yeah)

You talk that blah blah, that la la, that rah rah shit  
And I'm so done, I'm so over it  
Sometimes I mess up, I f*$% up, I hit and miss  
But I'm okay, I'm cool with it

I still fall on my face sometimes  
And I can't colour inside the lines  
'Cause I'm perfectly incomplete  
I'm still working on my masterpiece  
And I, I wanna hang with the greats  
Got a way to go, but it's worth the wait  
No, you haven't seen the best of me  
I'm still working on my masterpiece

Oooh, oooh  
Oooh, aaah  
Oooh, oooh  
Oooh, aaah

Those who mind don't matter  
Those who matter, don't mind  
If you don't catch what I'm throwing  
Then I'll leave you behind

Gone in a flash  
And I ain't living like that

They talk that blah blah, that la la, that rah rah shit  
Roll with the punches, and take the hits  
Sometimes I mess up, I f*$% up, I swing and miss  
But it's okay, I'm cool with it

I still fall on my face sometimes  
And I can't colour inside the lines  
'Cause I'm perfectly incomplete  
I'm still working on my masterpiece  
And I, I wanna hang with the greats  
Got a way to go, but it's worth the wait  
No, you haven't seen the best of me  
I'm still working on my masterpiece

Oooh, oooh  
Oooh, aaah  
Oooh, oooh  
Oooh, aaah

I still fall on my face sometimes  
And I can't colour inside the lines  
'Cause I'm perfectly incomplete  
I'm still working on my masterpiece  
Masterpiece, masterpiece (Yeeah)

I still fall on my face sometimes (still fall)  
And I can't colour inside the lines (inside the lines)  
'Cause I'm perfectly incomplete (perfectly incomplete)  
I'm still working on my masterpiece (on my masterpiece)  
And I, I wanna hang with the greats (oh, with the greats)  
Got a way to go, but it's worth the wait, no (wait, no)  
You haven't seen the best of me (b-b-best of me)  
I'm still working on my masterpiece (I'm still working on my masterpiece)

Oooh, oooh (Yeeah)  
Oooh, aaah (Hey)  
Oooh, oooh (Still working on, still working on)  
Oooh, aaah (Still working on my masterpiece)
