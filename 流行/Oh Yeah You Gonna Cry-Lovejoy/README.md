### Oh Yeah, You Gonna Cry?歌词：

You got the same eyes as your father  
And you carry the same kind of temper too  
Oh what a shame for the people of the community  
Favorite things fight and a lager  
Name a better way to spin out a jar or two  
He's a model citizen through and through you know  
But quite like your girlfriend  
How the f**k did she end up with you  
You know we talk about all the dumb s**t you do  
In the back room of the bar  
In the backseat of my car  
I'm the ending she's the start  
Well now now you need to calm down  
What good's this energy no good  
When you devote it to me  
Why not be a little more friendly  
Now now you need to calm down  
Does she still think of me  
Say my name in her sleep  
I thought you knew her better than me  
Don't give me that face  
You know that the chase is through  
And well she's still running away from you  
You got the same eyes as your father  
And you carry the same kind of temper too  
And she told me that she f**king hates you  
Now now you need to calm down  
What good's this energy no good  
When you devote it to me  
Why not be a little more friendly  
Now now you need to calm down  
Does she still think of me  
Say my name in her sleep  
I thought you knew her better than me  
Woo  
Yeah  
I thought you knew her better than me  
Woo  
Well now now you need to calm down  
What good's this energy  
When you devote it to me  
Why not be a little more friendly  
Now now you need to calm down  
What good's this energy no good  
When you devote it to me  
Why not be a little more friendly  
Now now you need to calm down  
Does she still think of me  
Say my name in her sleep  
I thought you knew her better than me
