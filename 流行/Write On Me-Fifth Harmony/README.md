### Write On Me歌词：

Pick up the pen, put it on the paper  
Write on my skin, bring me to life  
Can't start again, there ain't no eraser  
All of my flaws, you got them so right  
Everything is blank until you draw me  
Touching on my body like you know me  
Write on me  
Color outside the lines  
Love the way you tat me up  
Baby take your time  
Write on me  
Give me some wings, I'll fly  
Love the way you tat me up  
I'll never change my mind  
Write on me, write on me  
Write on me, write on me  
(Write on me)  
Write on me (write on me)  
Write on me  
Love the way you tat me up  
Write on me  
You are my friend, straight and no chaser  
Burns going down but it keeps me alive  
Tell me the truth, I like the danger  
Cause in the end you will be mine  
Everything is gray until you draw me  
Touching on my body like you know me  
Write on me  
Color outside the lines  
Love the way you tat me up  
Baby take your time  
Write on me  
Give me some wings, I'll fly  
Love the way you tat me up  
I'll never change my mind  
Write on me, write on me  
Write on me, write on me  
I could see a city sleep  
I could see an ocean wave  
Everything is changing and it's written on my face  
I could see a city sleep  
I could see an ocean wave  
Everything is changing and it's written on my face  
Write on me  
Color outside the lines  
Love the way you tat me up  
Baby take your time  
Write on me  
Give me some wings, I'll fly  
Love the way you tat me up  
I'll never change my mind  
Write on me, write on me  
Write on me, write on me  
(Write on me)  
Write on me (write on me)  
Write on me  
(Won't you write on me yeah)  
Love the way you tat me up  
Write on me  
Write on me  
Write on me  
Write on me
