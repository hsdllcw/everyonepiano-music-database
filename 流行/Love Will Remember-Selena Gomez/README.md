### Love Will Remember歌词：

[Intro]  
Hey babe it's me, uhm I just wanted to call and tell you that I love you so so
so so much. I just wanted to let you know that you are my princess, you are
worthy of all of the love in the world. You are the love of my life

[Verse 1]  
Now is all we got  
And time can't be bought  
I know it inside my heart, forever will forever be ours  
Even if we try to forget  
Love will remember  
You said you loved me, I said I loved you back  
What happened to that? What happened to that  
All your promises and all them plans we had  
What happened to that? What happened to that  
[Chorus]  
Boom. Gone  
Yeah we move on  
Even if we try to forget  
Love will remember you  
And love will remember me  
I know it inside my heart, forever will forever be ours  
Even if we try to forget  
Love will remember, love will remember  
Love will remember, love will remember  
Love will remember

[Verse 2]  
The trips we dreamed of taking, the tacks left on the map  
What happened to that? What happened to that  
When all you had was nothing, and all we did was laugh  
What happened, what happened, what happened to that?

[Chorus]  
Boom. Gone  
Yeah we move on  
Even if we try to forget  
Love will remember you  
And love will remember me  
I know it inside my heart, forever will forever be ours  
Even if we try to forget  
Love will remember, love will remember  
Love will remember, love will remember  
Love will remember, love will remember  
Love will remember, love will remember  
Love will remember

[Bridge]  
Break down the walls, let heaven in  
Somewhere in forever we'll dance again  
We used to be inseparable  
I used to think that I was irreplaceable  
We lit the whole world up before we blew it up  
I still don't know just how we screwed it up  
Forever forever forever

[Outro]  
Love will remember you  
And love will remember me  
I know it inside my heart, forever will forever be ours  
Even if we try to forget  
Love will remember, love will remember  
Love will remember, love will remember  
Love will remember, love will remember  
Love will remember, love will remember  
Love will remember
