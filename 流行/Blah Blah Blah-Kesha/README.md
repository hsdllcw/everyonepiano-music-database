### Blah Blah Blah歌词：

Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah  
Coming out your mouth with your blah blah blah  
Zip your lips like a padlock  
And meet me at the back with the jack and the jukebox  
I don't really care where you live at  
Just turn around boy and let me hit that  
Don't be a little bitch with your chit chat  
Just show me where your dick's at  
Music's up  
Listen hot stuff  
I'm in love  
With this song  
So just hush  
Baby shut up  
Heard enough  
Stop ta-ta-talking that  
Blah blah blah  
Think you'll be getting this  
Nah nah nah  
Not in the back of my  
Car-ar-ar  
If you keep talking that  
Blah blah blah blah blah  
Boy come on get your rocks off  
Come put a little love in my glove box  
I wanna dance with no pants on, holla  
Meet me in the back with the jack and the jukebox  
So cut to the chase kid  
'Cause I know you don't care what my middle name is  
I'm gonna be naked  
And you're wasted  
Music's up  
Listen hot stuff  
I'm in love  
With this song  
So just hush  
Baby shut up  
Heard enough  
Stop ta-ta-talking that  
Blah blah blah  
Think you'll be getting this  
Nah nah nah  
Not in the back of my  
Car-ar-ar  
If you keep talking that  
Blah blah blah blah blah  
You be delaying,  
You always be saying some shit  
You say I'm playing,  
I'm never laying the true  
Sayin', "Blah, blah blah."  
'Cause I don't care who you are  
In this bar  
It only matters who I is  
Stop ta-ta-talking that  
Blah blah blah  
Think you'll be getting this  
Nah nah nah  
Not in the back of my  
Car-ar-ar  
If you keep talking that  
Blah blah blah blah blah  
Blah blah blah  
Stop talking  
Stop ta-ta-talking that
