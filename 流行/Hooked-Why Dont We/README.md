### Hooked歌词：

Jack Avery：  
Ooh you got a bad you got you got you  
You've got a bad reputation in my neighborhood  
You drive me mad with temptation 'cause it tastes so good  
You know I wouldn't walk away even if I could  
It took one night one try ayy  
Both：  
D**n I'm hooked oh  
Daniel Seavey：  
You were there when I was low you held me high  
And baby when you take control we can go all night  
Every single place we go you start a fight  
But then you kiss my neck and take a bite  
Zach Herron：  
Everybody says I'm sleeping with the enemy  
I don't even care if you're gonna be the death of me me me  
Jack Avery：  
You've got a bad reputation in my neighborhood  
You drive me mad with temptation 'cause it tastes so good  
You know I wouldn't walk away even if I could  
It took one night one try ayy  
Both：  
D**n I'm hooked  
Ooh I'm hooked  
Ooh I'm hooked  
Daniel Seavey：  
Brrr- ah pa pa  
Jonah Marais：  
Ooh I know that I shouldn't touch but you twist my heart  
'Cause I can never get enough once the feeling starts  
Baby I'm the gasoline and your kiss is the spark  
But then you take the wheel and crash my car  
Zach Herron：  
Everybody says I'm sleeping with the enemy  
I don't even care if you're gonna be the death of me me me  
Jack Avery：  
You've got a bad reputation in my neighborhood  
You drive me mad with temptation 'cause it tastes so good  
You know I wouldn't walk away even if I could  
It took one night one try ayy  
Both：  
D**n I'm hooked  
Ooh I'm hooked  
Ooh I'm hooked  
Corbyn Besson：  
You got me under your influence  
I swear I'm never gonna give you up up up up up up up  
Jack Avery：  
You've got a bad reputation in my neighborhood  
You drive me mad with temptation 'cause it tastes so good  
You know I wouldn't walk away even if I could  
It took one night one try ayy  
Both：  
D**n I'm hooked  
Ooh I'm hooked  
Ooh I'm hooked oh
