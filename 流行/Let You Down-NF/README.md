### Let You Down歌词：

Feels like we're on the edge right now  
I wish that I could say I'm proud  
I'm sorry that I let you down  
Let you down  
All these voices in my head get loud  
I wish that I could shut them out  
I'm sorry that I let you down  
Let you down  
Yeah I guess I'm a disappointment  
Doing everything I can  
I don't wanna make you disappointed  
It's annoying  
I just wanna make you feel like everything  
I ever did wasn't ever tryna make an issue for you  
But I guess the more you  
Thought about everything you were never even wrong in the first place right  
Yeah I'ma just ignore you  
Walking towards you with my head down  
Lookin' at the ground I'm embarrassed for you  
Paranoia what did I do wrong this time  
That's parents for you  
Very loyal  
Shoulda had my back but you put a knife into my hands before  
What else should I carry for you  
I cared for you but  
Feels like we're on the edge right now  
I wish that I could say I'm proud  
I'm sorry that I let you down  
Let you down  
All these voices in my head get loud  
I wish that I could shut them out  
I'm sorry that I let you down  
Let you down  
Yeah you don't wanna make this work  
You just wanna make this worse  
Want me to listen to you  
But you don't ever hear my words  
You don't wanna know my hurt yet  
Let me guess you want an apology probably  
How can we keep going at a rate like this  
We can't so I guess I'ma have to leave  
Please don't come after me  
I just wanna be alone right now I don't really wanna think at all  
Go ahead just drink it off  
Both know you're gonna call tomorrow like nothing's wrong  
Ain't that what you always do  
I feel like every time I talk to you you're in an awful mood  
What else can I offer you  
There's nothing left right now I gave it all to you  
Feels like we're on the edge right now  
I wish that I could say I'm proud  
I'm sorry that I let you down  
Let you down  
All these voices in my head get loud  
I wish that I could shut them out  
I'm sorry that I let you down  
Let you down  
Yeah don't talk down to me  
That's not gonna work now  
Packed all my clothes and I moved out  
I don't even wanna go to your house  
Everytime I sit on that couch  
I feel like you lecture me  
Eventually I bet that we  
Could have made this work  
And probably woulda figured things out  
But I guess I'm a letdown  
But it's cool I checked out  
Oh you wanna be friends now  
Okay let's put my fake face on and pretend now  
Sit around and talk about the good times  
That didn't even happen  
I mean why are you laughing  
Must have missed that joke  
Let me see if I can find a reaction  
No but at least you're happy  
Feels like we're on the edge right now  
I wish that I could say I'm proud  
I'm sorry that I let you down  
Oh I let you down  
All these voices in my head get loud  
And I wish that I could shut them out  
I'm sorry that I let you down  
Oh let you down  
I'm sorry  
I'm so sorry now  
I'm sorry  
That I let you down
