### Memories歌词：

Here's to the ones that we got  
Cheers to the wish you were here but you're not  
Cause the drinks bring back all the memories  
Of everything we've been through  
Toast to the ones here today  
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way  
Cause the drinks bring back all the memories  
And the memories bring back  
Memories bring back you  
There's a time that I remember when I did not know no pain  
When I believed in forever  
And everything would stay the same  
Now my heart feel like December  
When somebody say your name  
Cause I can't reach out to call you but I know I will one day  
Hey  
Everybody hurts sometimes everybody hurts someday  
Eh eh  
Everything gon' be alright go on raise a glass and say  
Eh  
Here's to the ones that we got  
Cheers to the wish you were here but you're not  
Cause the drinks bring back all the memories  
Of everything we've been through  
Toast to the ones here today  
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way  
Cause the drinks bring back all the memories  
And the memories bring back  
Memories bring back you  
Doo do do do do do  
Doo do do do do do do  
Doo do do do do do  
Memories bring back  
Memories bring back you  
There's a time that I remember when I never felt so lost  
When I felt that all the hatred was too powerful to stop  
Now my heart feel like an ember  
And it's lighting up the dark  
I'll carry these torches for ya  
That you know I'll never drop  
Yeah  
Everybody hurts sometimes everybody hurts someday  
Eh eh  
Everything gon' be alright go on raise a glass and say  
Eh  
Here's to the ones that we got  
Cheers to the wish you were here but you're not  
Cause the drinks bring back all the memories  
Of everything we've been through  
Toast to the ones here today  
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way  
Cause the drinks bring back all the memories  
And the memories bring back  
Memories bring back you  
Doo do do do do do  
Doo do do do do do do  
Doo do do do do do  
Memories bring back  
Memories bring back you  
Doo do do do do do  
Doo do do do do do do  
Doo do do do do do  
Memories bring back  
Memories bring back you  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Memories bring back  
Memories bring back you
