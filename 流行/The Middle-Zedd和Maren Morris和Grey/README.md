**The Middle双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_The Middle_ 是由德国音乐制作人Zedd与电音组合Grey合作制作、由美国歌手Maren
Morris演唱的歌曲，单曲于2018年1月23日发行。这首歌继承了上支《Stay》的风格！曲风很赞好听啊！虽然看到最后莫名有种春晚的感觉，但是女声开口跪，而且节奏感超强！

Zedd，原名Anton
Zaslavski，1989年9月2日出生于俄罗斯萨拉托夫，他是一个音乐奇才，音乐曲风以电气浩室、前卫浩室为主。他为商业电子舞曲在主流音乐界里发展打下来基础。他长相帅气，就像一个美国男生乐队里最受欢迎的成员。

### The Middle歌词：

Take a seat  
Right over there  
Sat on the stairs  
Stay or leave  
The cabinets are bare  
And I'm unaware  
Of just how we got  
Into this mess  
Got so aggressive  
I know we meant  
All good intentions  
So pull me closer  
Why don't you pull me close  
Why don't you come on over  
I can't just let you go  
Baby  
Why don't you just meet me in the middle  
I'm losing my mind just a little  
So why don't you just meet me in the middle  
In the middle  
Baby  
Why don't you just meet me in the middle  
I'm losing my mind just a little  
So why don't you just meet me in the middle  
In the middle  
Take a step  
Back for a minute  
Into the kitchen  
Floors are wet  
Taps are still running  
Dishes are broken  
How did we get  
Into this mess  
Got so aggressive  
I know we meant  
All good intentions  
So pull me closer  
Why don't you pull me close  
Why don't you come on over  
I can't just let you go  
Baby  
Why don't you just meet me in the middle  
I'm losing my mind just a little  
So why don't you just meet me in the middle  
In the middle  
Looking at you I can't lie  
Just pouring out admission  
Regardless my objection  
And it's not about my pride  
I need you on my skin just  
Come over pull me in just  
Baby  
Why don't you just meet me in the middle  
I'm losing my mind just a little  
So why don't you just meet me in the middle  
In the middle  
Baby  
Why don't you just meet me in the middle  
I'm losing my mind just a little  
So why don't you just meet me in the middle  
In the middle  
Middle  
Baby  
Why don't you just meet me in the middle  
Baby  
I'm losing my mind just a little  
So why don't you just meet me in the middle  
Middle  
In the middle  
Middle
