英国流行女子音乐组合Little Mix于11月18日发布最新专辑《Glory Days (Deluxe Concert Film Edition)》。
_Touch_ 是专辑中的一首单曲。

Little Mix（小混合、小混混）她们因打破传统成为英国人气歌唱比赛The X
Factor史上第一个夺冠的团体而成名，除此之外，她们的夺冠经历更改写了女子团体在比赛中一定走不远的命运。Little Mix不仅改写了The X
Factor的历史，赛后也有傲人的成绩，她们是自2005年以来第一个不用在The X Factor上表演就能够首单空降英国单曲榜的冠军。Little
Mix的另一卖点是她们完美的和声，在现今众多女子组合都不再流行和声的年代，这四个女孩在The X
Factor上一次又一次的精彩演出为她们带来了大量的支持者，她们在第7周演绎的歌曲"Don't Let
Go"更是因为她们的表演而在多年后重新于英国单曲榜中出现。

### Touch歌词：

You and I and nobody else  
Feeling feelings I never felt  
The way you got me under your spell  
Don't you keep it all to yourself

So won't you take it, I feel like for the first time I am not faking  
Fingers on my buttons and now you're playing  
Master of anticipation  
Don't you keep it all to yourself

Just a touch of your love is enough  
To knock me off of my feet all week  
Just a touch of your lo-ove  
Just a touch of your lo-ove  
Just a touch of your love is enough  
To take control of my whole body  
Just a touch of your lo-ove  
Just a touch of your lo-ove

Just a touch of your love is enough  
To knock me off of my feet all week  
Just a touch of your lo-ove  
Just a touch of your lo-ove  
Just a touch of your love is enough  
To take control of my whole body  
Just a touch of your lo-ove  
Just a touch of your lo-hey-ove

Photograph with no T-shirt on  
Why you making me wait so long? (Wait so long)  
I promise to keep this a secret, I'll never tell  
But don't you keep it all to yourself

So won't you take it, I feel like for the first time I am not faking  
Fingers on my buttons and now you're playing  
Master of anticipation  
Don't you keep it all to yourself (To yourself)

Just a touch of your love is enough  
To knock me off of my feet all week  
Just a touch of your lo-ove (Just a touch)  
Just a touch of your lo-ove (Just a touch)  
Just a touch of your love is enough  
To take control of my whole body  
Just a touch of your lo-ove (Just a touch, just a touch)  
Just a touch of your lo-ove (Just a touch, just a touch)

Just a touch of your love is enough  
To knock me off of my feet all week (knock me off my feet)  
Just a touch of your love, hey  
Just a touch of your love, hey  
Just a touch of your love is enough  
To take control of my whole body (body)  
Just a touch of your love, hey  
Just a touch of your lo-hey-ove

And now my whole week, my whole week is golden (yeah)  
Can you see me glowing? That's how I feel (feel)  
And I'm not afraid to fade into emotions (yeah)  
'Cause I know that this could be something real (oooh)

Just a touch of your love is enough  
To knock me off of my feet all week (knock me off my feet)  
Just a touch of your lo-ove (hey)  
Just a touch of your lo-ove (just a touch)  
Just a touch of your love is enough  
To take control of my whole body (body)  
Just a touch of your lo-ove (Only a touch of your love)  
Just a touch of your lo-ove (Want a touch of your)

Just a touch of your love is enough  
To knock me off of my feet all week  
Just a touch of your love, hey (Just a touch)  
Just a touch of your love, hey (Just a touch)  
Just a touch of your love is enough  
To take control of my whole body (oh yeah)  
Just a touch of your love, hey  
Just a touch of your lo-ove
