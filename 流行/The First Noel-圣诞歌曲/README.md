**The First Nowell** (also written The First Noël)
是一首经典的英文圣诞颂歌，起源于18世纪甚至更早的英国。现在流行的四重唱版本由英国作曲家John Stainer所作。Noel源于法语单词Noël（意思是
_圣诞节_ ），拉丁语单词natalis（“诞生日”）。

### "圣诞歌曲 - The First Noel" 歌词：

CHORUS:

The first Noel the Angels did say

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay

In fields where they lay keeping their sheep

On a cold winter's night that was so deep.

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel

Born is the King of Israel

VERSE1:

They looked up and saw a star

Shining in the east, beyond them far

And to the earth it gave great light

And so it continued both day and night

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel

Born is the King of Israel

(The following 4 verses are not sung on the Boney M version)

And by the light of that same star

Three wise men came from country far;

To seek for a king was their intent,

And to follow the star wherever it went.

(CHORUS)

This star drew nigh to the northwest,

O'er Bethlehem it took it rest,

And there it did both stop and stay

Right over the place where Jesus lay.

(CHORUS)

Then entered in those wise men three

Full reverently upon their knee,

and offered there in his presence

Their gold, and myrrh, and frakincense.

(CHORUS)

Then let us all with one accord

Sing praises to our heavenly Lord;

That hath made heaven and earth of naught,

And with his blood mankind hath bought.

(CHORUS)

The first Noel the Angels did say

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay

In fields where they lay keeping their sheep

On a cold winter's night that was so deep.

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel

Born is the King of Israel
