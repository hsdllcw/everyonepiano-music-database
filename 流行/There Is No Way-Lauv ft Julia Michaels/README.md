**There's No Way** 是由Julia Michaels、Ari Leff、Ian Kirkpatrick、Justin
Tranter作词、作曲，Lauv、Julia Michaels演唱的一首歌曲。

每每听这首歌的时候，喜欢闭上眼睛，满脑子都是封面的那副场景，满眼的蓝色，梦幻而不可得，不期而遇的突然而惊喜，不可避免的热烈而隐逸，意料之内的离别又无望的相遇。既然如此又为何相遇，惊艳了时光却不能温柔岁月，但这短暂的相遇炽热，绵长，刻骨铭心。
有种期待已久的感觉，但不得不放下，到后来释然的畅快，也许这就是生命里的过客吧！

### There's No Way歌词：

Lauv：  
You touch me and it's almost like we knew  
That there will be history between us two  
We knew someday that we would have regrets  
But we just ignored them the night we met  
We just dance backwards into each other  
Trying to keep our feelings secretly covered  
You touch me and it's almost like we knew  
That there will be history  
Lauv/Julia Michaels：  
But there's no way that it's not going there  
With the way that we're looking at each other  
There's no way that it's not going there  
Every second with you I want another  
But maybe we could hold off for one sec  
So we could keep this tension in check  
But there's no way that it's not going there  
With the way that we're looking at each other  
I wish I could make the time stop  
So we could forget everything and everyone  
I wish that the time would line up  
So we could just give in to what we want  
'Cause when I got somebody you don't  
And when you got somebody I don't  
I wish that the time would line up  
So we could just give in  
But there's no way that it's not going there  
Going it's not going there  
With the way that we're looking at each other  
There's no way that it's not going there  
Going it's not going there  
Every second with you I want another  
But maybe we could hold off for one sec  
So we could keep this tension in check  
But there's no way that it's not going there  
Going it's not going there  
With the way that we're looking at each other  
We just dance backwards into each other  
Tryna keep our feelings secretly covered  
We just dance backwards into each other  
We just keep on dancing  
Trying to keep our feelings secretly covered  
Right into each other  
You touched me and it's almost like we knew  
That there would be history  
But there's no way that it's not going there  
Going it's not going there  
With the way that we're looking at each other  
There's no way that it's not going there  
Going it's not going there  
Every second with you I want another  
But maybe we could hold off for one sec  
So we could keep this tension in check  
But there's no way that it's not going there  
Going it's not going there  
With the way that we're looking at each other  
We just keep on dancing right into each other  
We just keep on dancing right into each other
