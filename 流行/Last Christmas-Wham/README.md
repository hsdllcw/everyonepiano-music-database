### Last Christmas歌词：

Last Christmas  
I gave you my heart  
But the very next day you gave it away  
This year  
To save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special  
Last Christmas  
I gave you my heart  
But the very next day you gave it away  
You gave it away  
This year  
To save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special  
Special  
Once bitten and twice shy  
I keep my distance  
But you still catch my eye  
Tell me baby  
Do you recognize me  
Well  
It's been a year  
It doesn't surprise me  
Merry Christmas  
I wrapped it up and sent it  
With a note saying I love you  
I meant it  
Now I know what a fool I've been  
But if you kissed me now  
I know you'd fool me again  
Last Christmas  
I gave you my heart  
But the very next day you gave it away  
You gave it away  
This year  
To save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special  
Special  
Last Christmas  
I gave you my heart  
But the very next day you gave it away  
This year  
To save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special  
Special  
Oh  
Oh my baby  
A crowded room  
Friends with tired eyes  
I'm hiding from you  
And your soul of ice  
My god I thought you were  
Someone to rely on  
Me  
I guess I was a shoulder to cry on  
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart  
A man under cover but you tore me apart  
Tore me apart  
Ooh hoo  
Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again  
Last Christmas  
I gave you my heart  
But the very next day you gave it away  
You gave it away  
This year  
To save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special  
Special  
Last Christmas  
I gave you my heart  
But the very next day you gave  
You gave it away me away  
This year  
To save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special  
Special  
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart  
I gave you my heart  
A man under cover but you tore me apart  
Maybe next year  
I'll give it to someone  
I'll give it to someone special  
Special  
Someone
