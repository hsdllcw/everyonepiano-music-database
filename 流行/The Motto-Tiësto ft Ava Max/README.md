### The Motto歌词：

That's the motto  
Mhm  
Throw it back with no chaser with no trouble  
Mhm  
Poppin' that moet baby let's make some bubbles  
Mhm  
Puffin' on that gelato wanna be seeing double  
Gotta do what you gotta  
Believe it we ain't got no plans to leave here  
Tell all of your friends to be here  
We ain't gonna sleep all weekend  
Oh you know you know you know  
That's the motto  
Mhm  
Drop a few bills then pop a few champagne bottles  
Mhm  
Throwin' that money like you just won the lotto  
Mhm  
We been up all d**n summer  
Makin' that bread and butter  
Tell me did I just stutter  
That's thе motto  
Mhm  
Drop a few bills then pop a few champagnе bottles  
Mhm  
Throwin' that money like you just won the lotto  
Mhm  
We been up all d**n summer  
Makin' that bread and butter  
Tell me did I just stutter  
That's the motto  
I feel it  
That's the motto  
I feel it  
Hopped in the range can't feel my face  
The window's down  
Back to my place  
My birthday cake is comin' out  
Oh  
The way it's hittin' like I could go all night  
Don't want no bloodshot eyes  
So hold my drink let's fly  
Believe it we ain't got no plans to leave here  
Tell all of your friends to be here  
We ain't gonna sleep all weekend  
Oh you know you know you know  
That's the motto  
Mhm  
Drop a few bills then pop a few champagne bottles  
Mhm  
Throwin' that money like you just won the lotto  
Mhm  
We been up all d**n summer  
Oh  
Makin' that bread and butter  
Yeah  
Tell me did I just stutter  
That's the motto  
Mhm  
Drop a few bills then pop a few champagne bottles  
Mhm  
Throwin' that money like you just won the lotto  
Mhm  
We been up all d**n summer  
Oh  
Makin' that bread and butter  
Tell me did I just stutter  
That's the motto  
That's the motto  
I feel it  
I feel it  
I feel it
