### See You Again歌词：

Tyler, The Creator：  
Okay okay okay okay  
Okay okay oh  
You live in my dream state  
Relocate my fantasy  
I stay in reality  
You live in my dream state  
Any time I count sheep  
That's the only time we make up make up  
You exist behind my eyelids my eyelids  
Now I don't wanna wake up  
20/20 20/20 visions  
Cupid hit me Cupid hit me with precision eye  
Wonder if you look both ways  
When you cross my mind  
I said I said  
I'm sick of sick of sick of sick of chasing  
You're the one that's always running through my day dreams I  
I can only see your face when I close my eyes  
Kali Uchis/Tyler, The Creator：  
Can I get a kiss  
And can you make it last forever  
I said I'm 'bout to go to war  
And I don't know if I'ma see you again  
Can I get a kiss  
Can I  
And can you make it last forever  
Can you  
I said I'm 'bout to go to war  
I'm 'bout to  
And I don't know if I'ma see you again  
Ugh switch it up  
Tyler, The Creator：  
I said okay okay okay okie dokie my infatuation  
Is translatin' to another form of what you call it  
Love  
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah I ain't met you  
I've been looking stop the waiting  
'Fore I stop the chasing like an alcoholic  
"You don't understand me" what the f**k do you mean  
It's them rose-tinted cheeks yeah it's them dirt-colored eyes  
Sugar honey iced tea bumblebee on the scene  
Yeah I'd give up my bakery to have a piece of your pie  
Uugh  
20/20 20/20 visions  
Cupid hit me Cupid hit me with precision eye  
Wonder if you look both ways  
When you cross my mind  
I said I said  
I'm sick of sick of sick of sick of chasing  
You're the one that's always running through my day dreams I  
I can only see your face when I close my eyes  
So  
Kali Uchis：  
Can I get a kiss  
Can I get a kiss  
And can you make it last forever  
Make it last forever  
I said I'm 'bout to go to war

I don't know if I'ma see you again  
See you again

And can you make it last forever
