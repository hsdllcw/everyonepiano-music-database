### 22歌词：

I see 22, oh, when I think of you  
Lately, that's all I do  
Don't you know that I, I'm always driving by  
Wanna come home to you  
Oh, I know I've always been afraid to say  
How I feel, but this's got to change  
Every time I'm with somebody I'm confusing him with you  
Anywhere I go reminds me of the things we used to do  
And I dream about the street where we kissed out of the blue  
At your house, number 22  
Baby, where are you?  
Number 22  
I see 22, oh, it's like déjà vu  
Boy, if you only knew  
This time I messed it up, but I can't give you up  
Your face is all I've got  
Yeah, I know I've always been afraid to say  
How I feel, but this's got to change  
Every time I'm with somebody I'm confusing him with you  
Anywhere I go reminds me of the things we used to do  
And I dream about the street where we kissed out of the blue  
At your house, number 22  
Number 22, yeah  
Baby, where are you?  
Number 22  
All alone tonight  
Wishing you were laying by my side  
So I just keep on driving by  
To pass the time  
(Every time I'm with somebody I'm confusing him with you)  
(Anywhere I go reminds me of the things we used to do)Every time I'm with
somebody  
And I dream about the street where we kissed out of the blue  
At your house, number 22  
(Every time I'm with somebody I'm confusing him with you)  
Everybody, no, no, no  
(Anywhere I go reminds me of the things we used to do) I remember you  
(And I dream about the street where we kissed out of the blue) Number 22  
(At your house) Number 22
