**Young双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Young_ 是美国电子音乐组合The Chainsmokers的歌曲，收录在其专辑Memories...Do Not
Open中。专辑发行于2017年4月7日，共收录12首歌曲。

The
Chainsmokers在创作和制作两方面都做得十分精致，作为一个EDM组合，他们的强项其实并不是对EDM曲风的革命性开拓和创造。他们更像是一个流行小清新的EDM组合，注重的是作品的旋律性，音色的入耳度，整个氛围的舒适与体验，以及最重要的流行性。专注于音乐独特口味的打造外，他们还偏好发掘小众歌手，找到自己音乐在人声方面的支点，用许多绿叶，来衬托自己红红火火的EDM。所以，在The
Chainsmokers身上可以看到“庸众”崛起的场面，所谓“庸众”并非贬义，而是指那些暂时没有获得更多关注的实力派。

### Young歌词：

Young  
We were so young when we thought that we knew how to love  
Fought about anything  
Everything led to dysfunction  
But we just gotta own that shit  
Don't let it go like this  
Maybe we can grow from this  
Yeah  
We both know I go too far  
Like when I wrecked your car  
And almost fought your father when he pushed me in the yard  
And all those nights we snuck out  
Like to meet up at the bar  
Don't worry my love  
We're learning to love  
But it's hard when you're young  
Yeah  
It's hard when you're young  
Caught  
We were caught up in the high it was better than drugs  
Too hard to see that it all would lead to destruction  
At least we both know that shit  
We just gotta own that shit  
I hope that we can grow from this  
Yeah  
We both know I go too far  
Like when I wrecked your car  
And almost fought your father when he pushed me in the yard  
And all those nights we snuck out  
Like to meet up at the bar  
Don't worry my love  
We're learning to love  
But it's hard when you're young  
Yeah  
It's hard when you're young  
Yeah  
It's hard when you're young  
I'm calling you up  
You tell me it's over  
Say what you want  
But it's hard when you're  
Hard when you're young  
I'm calling you up  
You tell me it's over  
You say what you want  
But it's hard when you're young  
We both know I go too far  
Like when I wrecked your car  
And almost fought your father when he pushed me in the yard  
And all those nights we snuck out  
Like to meet up at the bar  
Don't worry my love  
We're learning to love  
But it's hard when you're young  
I'm calling you up  
You tell me it's over  
Say what you want  
But it's hard when you're young  
I'm calling you up  
You tell me it's over  
You say what you want  
But it's hard when you're young  
Yeah it's hard when you're young  
Yeah it's hard when you're young  
Yeah  
Yeah it's hard when you're young  
I'm calling you up  
You tell me it's over  
Say what you want  
But it's hard when you're young  
I'm calling you up  
You tell me it's over  
You say what you want  
But it's hard when you're young
