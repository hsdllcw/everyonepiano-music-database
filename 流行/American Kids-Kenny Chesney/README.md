American Kids歌词：

  
Doublewide Quick Stop midnight T-top  
Jack in her Cherry Coke town  
Momma and daddy put their roots right here  
‘Cause this is where the car broke down  
Yellow dog school bus kickin’ up red dust  
Pickin’ us up by a barbed wire fence  
MTV on the RCA, no A/C in the vents

We were Jesus save me, blue jean baby  
Born in the USA  
Trailer park truck stop, faded little map dots  
New York to LA  
We were teenage dreamin’, front seat leanin’  
Baby, come give me a kiss  
Put me on the cover of the Rolling Stone  
Uptown down home American kids  
Growin’ up in little pink houses  
Makin’ out on living room couches  
Blowin’ that smoke on Saturday night  
A little messed up, but we’re all alright

  
Baptist church parkin’ lot, tryin’ not to get caught  
Take her home and give her your jacket  
Makin’ it to second base, but sayin’ you went all the way  
Monday afternoon at practice  
Sister’s got a boyfriend daddy doesn’t like  
Now he’s sittin’ out back, 3030 in his lap  
In the blue bug zapper light

  
We were Jesus save me, blue jean baby  
Born in the USA  
Trailer park truck stop, faded little map dots  
New York to LA  
We were teenage dreamin’, front seat leanin’  
Baby, come give me a kiss  
Put me on the cover of the Rolling Stone  
Uptown down home American kids  
Growin’ up in little pink houses  
Makin’ out on living room couches  
Blowin’ that smoke on Saturday night  
A little messed up, but we’re all alright
