### In The Arms Of A Stranger歌词：

I was 16 with a rocket  
And some sunshine in my pocket  
It was how you used words I didn't know  
And the way you said my name  
And cut up peaches and them brown eyes  
Little flame that we pretend doesn't glow

You know space and time wouldn't let you be mine  
What I've come to understand  
Is entropy wouldn't leave you to me  
I'm right back where I began

In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love  
Holding her closely, remember your touch  
And I'm wrapped around your finger, even though I'm knocked up  
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love

There were times I think about us  
Overcome by the nostalgias  
I am on call when you need me, let me know  
But we're drifting in a strange way  
I'm aware that it's mistake if I love you  
It's a mistake if I don't

You know space and time wouldn't let you be mine  
What I've come to understand  
Is entropy wouldn't leave you to me  
I'm right back where I began

In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love  
Holding her closely, remember your touch  
And I'm wrapped around your finger, even though I'm knocked up  
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love

And she smelled like Michigan  
And it felt like lust  
And the nostalgia's killing me  
And it's all because

I'm in the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love  
Holding her closely, remember your touch  
And I'm wrapped around your finger, even though I'm knocked up  
In the arms of a stranger, stranger, stranger  
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love  
Holding her closely, remember your touch  
And I'm wrapped around your finger, even though I'm knocked up  
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love
