### Even If歌词：

They say sometimes you win some  
Sometimes you lose some  
And right now, right now I'm losing bad  
I've stood on this stage night after night  
Reminding the broken it'll be alright  
But right now, oh right now I just can't  
It's easy to sing  
When there's nothing to bring me down  
But what will I say  
When I'm held to the flame  
Like I am right now  
I know You're able and I know You can  
Save through the fire with Your mighty hand  
But even if You don't  
My hope is You alone  
They say it only takes a little faith  
To move a mountain  
Good thing  
A little faith is all I have right now  
But God, when You choose  
To leave mountains unmovable  
Give me the strength to be able to sing  
It is well with my soul  
I know You're able and I know You can  
Save through the fire with Your mighty hand  
But even if You don't  
My hope is You alone  
I know the sorrow, and I know the hurt  
Would all go away if You'd just say the word  
But even if You don't  
My hope is You alone  
You've been faithful, You've been good  
All of my days  
Jesus, I will cling to You  
Come what may  
‘Cause I know You're able  
I know You can  
I know You're able and I know You can  
Save through the fire with Your mighty hand  
But even if You don't  
My hope is You alone  
I know the sorrow, and I know the hurt  
Would all go away if You'd just say the word  
But even if You don't  
My hope is You alone  
It is well with my soul  
It is well, it is well with my soul
