### Pretty Hurts歌词：

Mr. third world, your first question  
What is your aspiration in life?  
Oh, my aspiration in life  
Would be to be happy  
Mama said, you're a pretty girl  
What's in your head, it doesn't matter  
Brush your hair, fix your teeth  
What you wear is all that matters  
Just another stage, pageant the pain away  
This time I'm gonna take the crown  
Without falling down, down  
Pretty hurts, shine the light on whatever's worse  
Perfection is a disease of a nation, pretty hurts, pretty hurts  
Pretty hurts, shine the light on whatever's worse  
Trying to fix something but you can't fix what you can't see  
It's the soul that needs the surgery  
Blonder hair, flat chest  
TV says bigger is better  
South beach, sugar free  
Vogue says thinner is better  
Just another stage  
Pageant the pain away  
This time I'm gonna take the crown  
Without falling down, down, down  
Pretty hurts, shine the light on whatever's worse  
Perfection is a disease of a nation, pretty hurts, pretty hurts (Pretty hurts)  
Pretty hurts (pretty hurts), shine the light on whatever's worse  
Trying to fix something but you can't fix what you can't see  
It's the soul that needs the surgery  
Ain't got no doctor, no computer can take the pain away  
The pain's inside and nobody frees you from your body  
It's the soul, it's the soul that needs surgery  
It's my soul that needs surgery  
Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far  
And you break when the paper sign leaves you in the dark  
You left a shattered mirror and the shards of a beautiful girl  
Pretty hurts, shine the light on whatever's worse (pretty hurts)  
Perfection is a disease of a nation, pretty hurts, pretty hurts  
Pretty hurts, shine the light on whatever's worse  
Trying to fix something but you can't fix what you can't see  
It's the soul that needs the surgery  
When you're alone all by yourself  
And you're lying in your bed  
Reflection stares right into you  
Are you happy with yourself  
It's just a way to masquerade  
The illusion that's been shed  
Are you happy with yourself?  
Are you happy with yourself?, yes
