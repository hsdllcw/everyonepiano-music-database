### Off the Table歌词：

Ariana Grande：  
Will I ever love the same way again  
Way again  
Will I ever love somebody like the way I did you  
Never thought you'd be so d**n hard to replace  
I swear I don't mean to be this way  
If I can't have you is love completely off the table  
Do I sit this one out and wait for the next life  
Next life  
Am I too cold  
Am I not nice  
Might not be quite yet healed or ready  
Should I be goin' too steady  
Too steady  
But I just wanna know is love completely off the table  
Ariana Grande：  
Will you bе there  
Will you be there  
Can I still love you  
Can I can I babe  
Not yet healed or ready  
Not ready  
Shouldn't be goin' too steady  
Too steady  
Just wanna know is love completely off the table  
The Weeknd/Ariana Grande：  
I'll wait for you  
Even though it always feels like I'll be number two  
To someone you can't hold anymore  
If you let me in I'm ready to give you what I couldn't before  
'Cause I got you girl let me help you through it  
You're trying to fill the void with a couple boys  
I can see right through it  
You can see right through it  
I can you love you harder than I did before  
Was in a dark place back then  
I was toxic then I was toxic to someone else  
I was haunted by the hills  
Oh yeah yeah  
I couldn't give you my all but I will  
If you let me in your arms  
Your arms  
If you let me in your heart  
I don't think that love's completely off the table  
Ariana Grande/The Weeknd：  
Will you be there  
Yes I will be there for you  
Can I still love you  
Not yet healed or ready  
Not ready  
Shouldn't be goin' too steady  
Too steady no no  
Just wanna know is love completely off the table  
Ariana Grande/The Weeknd：  
So can you hold me  
If I let you can you prove it to me  
Oh no-no no  
'Cause I need you to calm me down babe  
Gotta get out of my head  
Oh woah  
Tryna be healed from this pain  
Oh  
Just wanna know just wanna know can you baby  
Hey  
Can you touch it like you believe in it baby  
Oh hey  
Do you think you never gonna leave on me baby  
'Cause I ain't her and you ain't him thankfully  
Baby don't leave  
But it's gon' be hard to let someone else in again  
Woah  
Baby baby  
Woo-hoo  
Will you be there  
Will you be there  
I'll still wait  
Can I still love you  
I'll still wait for you babe oh no-no no can I still love you  
Not yet healed or ready  
Ooh not ready  
Shouldn't be goin' too steady  
No no ooh  
Just wanna know is love completely off the table baby  
The Weeknd：  
I swear I swear  
I will wait for you whenever you need  
Ooh ooh
