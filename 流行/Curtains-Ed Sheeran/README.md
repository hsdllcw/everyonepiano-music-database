《 **Curtains** 》是英国人气流行唱作男歌手Ed Sheeran演唱的歌曲，收录在其个人第六张录音室专辑《-"Subtract"》（减法）中。

作为当代欧美乐坛英伦体系男声的当之无愧人气代表，Ed
Sheeran的音乐唱作人生涯可谓是在褒贬不一的砥砺前行历程中乘风破浪，从首专开始就启动了运算符号系列的主题构想，在经过了“+”、“×”、“÷”、“=”后，这张全新专辑《-》成为了为这一系列进行最终收官的音乐作品。虽然整张专辑没有遵循他以往常规的编排定律，并且是全solo演绎的纯白呈现手法，但最终彰显出的微妙虔诚魅力还是足以达到令人共情的水准。

### Curtains歌词：

Can you pull the curtains  
Let me see the sunshine  
I think I'm done with my hiding place  
And you found me anyway  
It's been forever but I'm feeling alright  
Tears dry and will leave no trace  
And tomorrow's another day  
Hide and seek  
I am somewhere closed away  
You won't believe  
How long it's been since I started the game  
I can't be seen  
And you won't find me today  
I've not been this low but I'll be okay  
Are you alright Maybe don't ask  
'Coz you know I never like to talk about that  
Keep it inside yeah you say I always hold back  
And I always wear long sleeves  
Is it in your childhood Something happen in your past  
Well the sadness yeah I promise that it won't last  
And if I could I would try to take it all back  
But there's still more underneath  
And it's when you say to me  
Can you pull the curtains  
Let me see the sunshine  
I think I'm done with my hiding place  
And you found me anyway  
It's been forever but I'm feeling alright  
Tears dry and will leave no trace  
And tomorrow's another day  
Let me see the sun shine shine shine  
Let me see the sun shine shine shine  
Let me see the sun shine shine shine  
Let me see the sun shine  
Hide and seek  
Count to ten and close your eyes  
Try to breath  
See a message and don't reply  
Nice to meet but in reality say goodbye  
Life can be so beautiful if you try  
Are you okay Yeah I guess so  
But on some days I feel like I'm trapped in a hole  
But I keep quiet so the ones around me don't know  
That the mountains feels so steep  
And I'll say that I'm here to help to carry the load  
And the outside rays they are good for the soul  
So let's step out of the dark 'coz in here it's so cold  
The day's not out of reach  
And it's when you say to me  
Can you pull the curtains  
Let me see the sunshine  
I think I'm done with my hiding place  
And you found me anyway  
It's been forever but I'm feeling alright  
Tears dry and will leave no trace  
And tomorrow's another day  
Let me see the sun shine shine shine  
Let me see the sun shine shine shine  
Let me see the sun shine shine shine  
Let me see the sun shine
