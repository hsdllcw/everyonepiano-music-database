### Ferrari歌词：

Every day is a blur  
Sometimes I can't tell what day it is  
Don't know what day it is  
Can you tell me what day it is  
Life's passing by  
'Cause I'm out chasing empty highs  
Every hello just means goodbye  
But I'm looking for more this time  
Can we start to slow it down  
Can we learn to live right now  
I just want to feel it all  
I'm a Ferrari pulled off on Mulholland Drive  
Over the city the lights are so pretty from up here  
I'm a Ferrari and after the party is done  
I keep on going missing the moments  
Living in the fast lane is getting kind of lonely yeah  
Whoo ooh ooh-ooh  
Whoo ooh ooh-ooh-ooh  
Whoo ooh ooh-ooh  
Living in the fast lane is getting kind of lonely  
Whoo ooh ooh-ooh  
Whoo ooh ooh-ooh-ooh  
Whoo ooh ooh-ooh  
Living in the fast lane is getting kind of lonely  
Got a heavy heart  
'Cause it's still beating on its own  
Might be going out in the ground  
But I'm still coming home alone  
Not trying to say I'm not grateful for everything  
I'm just going too fast to see  
All the good things in front of me  
I'm a Ferrari pulled off on Mulholland Drive  
Over the city the lights are so pretty from up here  
I'm a Ferrari and after the party is done  
I keep on going missing the moments  
Living in the fast lane is getting kind of lonely  
Whoo ooh ooh-ooh  
Whoo ooh ooh-ooh-ooh  
Whoo ooh ooh-ooh  
Living in the fast lane is getting kind of lonely  
Whoo ooh ooh-ooh  
Whoo ooh ooh-ooh-ooh  
Whoo ooh ooh-ooh  
I'm a Ferrari pulled off on Mulholland Drive  
Over the city the lights are so pretty from up here  
I'm a Ferrari and after the party is done  
I keep on going missing the moments  
Living in the fast lane is getting kind of lonely
