### P.S. I Hope You're Happy歌词：

Welcome home  
How's your summer been  
I heard you moved in with your boyfriend  
In New York  
What's his name  
I heard he works downtown in finance  
Is he just as good at romance  
As we were  
Okay enough  
P.S. I hope you're happy  
I started acting out when you moved on  
I tried to call you  
To eliminate the distance  
I cared about you once  
And always will  
And I tried my best  
Cross my fingers for the rest  
And I will find a way somehow  
To be more than photos to you now  
I blame myself  
For when I was someone else  
I might not get over this  
But I won't be sad for the sake of it  
But I won't be sad for the sake of it  
But I won't be sad for the sake of it  
But I won't be sad for the sake of it  
But I won't be sad for the sake of it  
What the hell  
I couldn't help but check your phone  
Who the f**k is Drew from home anyway  
This vacation  
You said going home was boring  
Left out that part of the story on your way  
I might deserve it  
But I can't take it  
Maybe I should keep this to myself  
'Cause if I'm honest  
My record's less than flawless  
You know that I get lonely when you're gone  
And I tried my best  
Cross my fingers for the rest  
And I will find a way somehow  
To be more than photos to you now  
I blame myself  
For when I was someone else  
I might not get over this  
But I won't be sad for the sake of it  
But I won't be sad for the sake of it  
But I won't be sad for the sake of it  
But I won't be sad for the sake of it  
But I won't be sad for the sake of it  
But I won't be sad for the sake of it
