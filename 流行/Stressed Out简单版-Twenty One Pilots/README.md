_Stressed Out_
的音乐录影带于2015年4月28日释出，由马克•埃什尔曼执导。音乐录影带展示了一个试图重温童年的乐队。视频中，主唱约瑟夫•泰勒蹬踏着三轮车朝另一位乐队成员乔西•敦家开去，并在乔西的房间内完成了歌曲的部分表演。在经过商讨后，两人骑着三轮车将乐器运到了泰勒的房间内，继续进行着他们的演出。该音乐录影带同时穿插了二人的父母和兄弟姐妹的镜头。

### Stressed Out歌词：

I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard,  
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words,  
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new,  
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang,

I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink,  
But now I'm insecure and I care what people think.

My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think.  
My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think.

Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days,  
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out.  
Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days,  
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out.

We're stressed out.

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young,  
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from,  
I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it,  
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one,

It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose,  
Same clothes homegrown a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam,  
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered,  
Out of student loans and treehouse homes we all would take the latter.

My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think.  
My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think.

Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days,  
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out.  
Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days,  
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out.

We used to play pretend, give each other different names,  
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away,  
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face,  
Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money."  
Yo.

We used to play pretend, give each other different names,  
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away,  
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face,  
Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money."  
Yo.

Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days,  
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out.  
Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days,  
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out.

Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, bunny  
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money  
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, bunny  
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money  
We used to play pretend, give each other different names,  
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away,  
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face,  
Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money."  
Yo.
