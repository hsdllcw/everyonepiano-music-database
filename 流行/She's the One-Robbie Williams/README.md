### She's the One歌词：

I was her she was me  
We were one we were free  
And if there's somebody calling me on  
She's the one  
If there's somebody calling me on  
She's the one

We were young we were wrong  
We were fine all along  
If there's somebody calling me on  
She's the one  
When you get to where you wanna go  
And you know the things you wanna know  
You're smiling  
When you said what you wanna say  
And you know the way you wanna play  
You'll be so high you'll be flying

Though the sea will be strong  
I know we'll carry on  
Cos if there's somebody calling me on  
She's the one  
If there's somebody calling me on  
She's the one

When you get to where you wanna go  
And you know the things you wanna know  
You're smiling

When you said what you wanna say  
And you know the way you wanna say it  
You'll be so high you'll be flying

I was her she was me  
We were one we were free  
If there's somebody calling me on  
She's the one  
If there's somebody calling me on  
She's the one

If there's somebody calling me on  
She's the one  
Yeah she's the one

If there's somebody calling me on  
She's the one  
She's the one

If there's somebody calling me on  
She's the one
