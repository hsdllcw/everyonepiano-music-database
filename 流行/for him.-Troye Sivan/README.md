### for him.歌词：

We are runnin' so fast  
And we never look back  
And whatever I lack, you make up  
We make a really good team  
Though not everyone sees  
We got this crazy chemistry  
Between us

Jump starting your car 'cause this city's a bore  
Buying e-cigarettes at the convenience store  
Making new clichés on our own little tour  
Let's ride

You don't have to say I love you to say I love you  
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons  
We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue  
Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money  
All I need is you  
All I need is you, you

We try staying up late  
But we both are light weights  
Yeah we get off our face, too easy  
And we take jokes way too far  
'Cause sometimes living's too hard  
We're like two halves of one heart  
We are, we are, we are

You don't have to say I love you to say I love you  
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons  
We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue  
Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money  
All I need is you  
All I need is you, you

[Verse three by AllDay:]  
Eat a pill stay and chill, you don't need to go  
I'm about to bring emo back if you leave my home  
I'd panic at the disco and you'd rather watch a TV show  
Then I'll squeeze your booty real hard like I'm kneading dough  
Pizza boy, I'm speeding for ya  
We can get married tonight if you really wanna  
Me in a cheap suit like a sleazy lawyer  
And if you break this lil' heart, it'd be an honour

[Alternative verse three by Troye Sivan:]  
We're not a commercial for anyone else  
We go out for coffee  
And keep it to ourselves  
We make little homes out of three star hotels  
And I know what you're feeling  
'Cause I feel it as well

You don't have to say I love you to say I love you  
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons  
We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue  
Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money  
All I need is you  
All I need is you, you
