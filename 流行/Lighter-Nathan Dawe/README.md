### Lighter歌词：

I used to think I couldn't be without you be without you  
Now that you're gone I feel happy as hell  
KSI Nathan Dawe ah  
When you said it was over  
I knew I'd fallen too deep  
You made my world feel perfect  
Then pulled it from under my feet  
I cried for a minute  
For a while I was tryin' to figure out what went wrong  
Now I finally get it  
And I see I don't need you to be here I'm movin' on  
I used to think I couldn't be without you be without you  
Now that you're gone I feel happy as hell  
Weight off of me  
I can breathe without you breathe without you  
Now that you're gone I feel lighter  
I used to think I couldn't be without you be without you  
Now that you're gone I feel happy as hell  
Weight off of me  
I can breathe without you breathe without you  
Ayy ayy  
Now that you're gone I feel lighter  
Nathan  
I'm feelin' so good like a fat man with a peng ting  
Yeah  
Feelin' so high like a black Yao Ming  
Ayy  
Call me Godzilla 'cause I got a big part  
Uh  
Went through war got a purple heart  
Needed my space time recovery  
Now man's ace quick summary  
New discovery losin' that weight  
Post on the 'Gram 'cause I'm just bait  
I'm way too slick with it  
Woo  
John Wick with it  
Woo  
I'm takin' bare shots in a quick minute  
Ayy  
More drinks with it bare sick with it  
Come on  
Still end up in a bed with a chick in it  
Mad  
VVS1 on my chain bust down  
Been through a lot now a man's got a crown  
KSI verified stay schemin' self-believin' you know I  
I used to think I couldn't be without you be without you  
Now that you're gone I feel happy as hell  
Weight off of me  
I can breathe without you breathe without you  
Now that you're gone I feel lighter  
I used to think I couldn't be without you be without you  
Now that you're gone I feel happy as hell  
Weight off of me  
I can breathe without you breathe without you  
Now that you're gone I feel lighter  
Yeah mm  
I cried for a minute  
For a while I was tryin' to figure out what went wrong  
Now I finally get it  
And I see I don't need you to be here I'm movin' on  
Oh no oh  
I used to think I couldn't be without you be without you  
Now that you're gone I feel happy as hell  
Weight off of me  
I can breathe without you breathe without you  
Now that you're gone I feel lighter  
Gone  
I feel lighter  
Gone  
I feel lighter  
Gone  
I feel lighter  
Gone  
I feel lighter  
Gone  
I feel lighter  
Gone  
I feel lighter  
Oh no  
Now that you're gone I feel lighter
