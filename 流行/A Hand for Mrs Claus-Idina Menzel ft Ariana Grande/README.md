### A Hand for Mrs. Claus歌词：

Idina Menzel：  
Every December we always remember  
To celebrate the fella in the suit  
We see the promos for reindeer and his glow nose  
Believe me I think Rudolph's nose is cute  
Now I'm a fan of Frosty  
I go ga-ga for The Grinch  
But beneath the hype are they the type  
You'd turn to in a pinch  
There's someone more deserving of applause  
How 'bout a hand for Mrs. Claus  
Mm  
Ariana Grande：  
I'm not complaining  
I'm sure it's very draining  
Pulling off a Christmas Eve world tour  
My point in this is it's his marvelous missus  
Who gets it done the other three-six-four  
Who's really checkin' all those lists  
And fillin' all them shelves  
She's a master multitasker who works faster than the elves  
Who keeps the North Pole hot 'til winter thaws  
The answer's clear it's Mrs. Claus  
Mm  
Idina Menzel/Ariana Grande：  
She reads every Christmas letter  
Fills out a Christmas sweater  
Better than old Santa any day  
She runs the operation  
With no appreciation  
Send a little Christmas love her way  
Oh oh yeah  
Idina Menzel：  
She just gets no respect  
She works so hard  
Now I'll sing a fa-la-la  
And I'll shout a ho-ho-ho  
But I'm bouncin' out this ballad for the gal who runs the show  
Join me in this very worthy cause  
How 'bout a hand for  
Oh oh yeah  
Let's make it grand for  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Everybody stand for Mrs. Claus
