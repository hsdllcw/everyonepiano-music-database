Your b***h cheatin' she under my cover we cuddle and s**t  
Young Thug：  
Now shawty say she wanna suck on the tip  
I'm 'bout it baby I want all four of your lips  
I'm 'bout it  
Ex-college girl she can suck up a ship  
I eat molly and I take this b***h on a trip  
Ayy shawty ayy darlin' ayy baby girl suck my private  
Close your eyes it's just me and you and nobody  
Ayy suck it sideways if we in public or the driveway  
Hey

Red coupe rollercoaster sound just like it does  
These days I balance all the hate out with the love  
These days I pour all of my pain out in a cup  
Drank  
Dreamy that's just a side effect when you with us

Easy the dawgs is right behind me they on edge  
Believe me we pop out in the city to collect  
Ooh  
Vibes in this b***h they surprised that I lived  
It's lit  
Try can't be killed tried nine times but I'm Stilts  
Hop in the whip to hop right in the whip  
I hotbox in the whip got me
