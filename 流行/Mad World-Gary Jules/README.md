**Mad World** 是美国男歌手Gary Jules的一首翻唱曲目。Gary
Jules被认为是90年代末崛起的最值得关注的创作人之一。他的风格是典型的soft rock，跟Paul
Simon一样，擅长发掘人们情感的细枝末节，不激亢不冲动，嗓音很soulful很柔和，有着岁月沉淀的深度和味道。

### Mad World歌词：

All around me are familiar faces  
Worn out places, worn out faces  
Bright and early for the daily races  
Going nowhere, going nowhere  
Their tears are filling up their glasses  
No expression, no expression  
Hide my head I want to drown my sorrow  
No tomorrow, no tomorrow  
And I find it kinda funny  
I find it kinda sad  
The dreams in which I'm dying  
Are the best I've ever had  
I find it hard to tell you  
I find it hard to take  
When people run in circles  
It's a very, very  
Mad world mad world  
Children waiting for the day they feel good  
Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday  
Made to feel the way that every child should  
Sit and listen, sit and listen  
Went to school and I was very nervous  
No one knew me, no one knew me  
Hello teacher tell me what's my lesson  
Look right through me, look right through me  
And I find it kinda funny  
I find it kinda sad  
The dreams in which I'm dying  
Are the best I've ever had  
I find it hard to tell you  
I find it hard to take  
When people run in circles  
It's a very, very  
Mad world mad world  
Enlarging your world  
Mad world
