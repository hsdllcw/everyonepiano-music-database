### Stay歌词：

Waiting for the time to pass you by  
Hope the winds of change will change your mind  
I could give a thousand reasons why  
And I know you, and you've got to

Make it on your own, but we don't have to grow up  
We can stay forever young  
Living on my sofa, drinking rum and cola  
Underneath the rising sun  
I could give a thousand reasons why  
But you're going, and you know that

All you have to do is stay a minute  
Just take your time  
The clock is ticking, so stay  
All you have to do is wait a second  
Your hands on mine  
The clock is ticking, so stay

All you have to do is  
All you have to do is stay

Won't admit what I already know  
I've never been the best at letting go  
I don't wanna spend the night alone  
Guess I need you, and I need to

Make it on my own, but I don't wanna grow up  
We can stay forever young  
Living on my sofa, drinking rum and cola  
Underneath the rising sun  
I could give a million reasons why  
But you're going, and you know that

All you have to do is stay a minute  
Just take your time  
The clock is ticking, so stay  
All you have to do is wait a second  
Your hands on mine  
The clock is ticking, so stay

All you have to do is  
All you have to do is stay

All you have to do is stay  
So stay, yeah

All you have to do is stay a minute  
Just take your time  
The clock is ticking, so stay  
All you have to do is wait a second  
Your hands on mine  
The clock is ticking, so stay  
All you have to do is stay
