### Mulberry Street歌词：

Keep your bliss  
There's nothing wrong with this  
Wrong with this  
Keep your bliss  
There's nothing wrong with this  
Wrong with this  
Keep your sunny days leave us in the rain  
Tie strings to our hands and feet to rain on your parade  
You can have the weekends we will live between them  
Keep your pills save your breath and don't ever forget  
Get our of our way we're moving sideways  
Welcome to Mulberry Street  
Yeah  
So move out of our way we're pushing sideways  
Keep sidewalk under your feet  
Ain't no sunny skies 'til you finally realize  
That everybody relies on synthetic highs  
They find someone to prescribe  
Keep your bliss  
There's nothing wrong with this  
We just want to feel it all  
Keep your pills save your breath and don't ever forget  
Get our of our way we're moving sideways  
Welcome to Mulberry Street  
Yeah  
So move out of our way we're pushing sideways  
Keep sidewalk under your feet  
When times aren't the best and I'm on the edge  
I'll listen for a song in the distance  
Mulberry Street so good to see you  
Mulberry Street so good to see you  
Mulberry Street so good to see you  
Mulberry Street  
And don't ever forget  
Get our of our way we're moving sideways  
Welcome to Mulberry Street  
Yeah  
So move out of our way we're pushing sideways  
Keep sidewalk under your feet  
Get our of our way we're moving sideways  
Welcome to Mulberry Street  
Yeah  
So move out of our way  
So good so good  
We're pushing sideways  
So good so good  
Keep sidewalk under your feet  
So good to see you  
Keep your bliss  
There's nothing wrong with this
