**I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day** 是一首圣诞颂歌，其源于1863年美国诗人Henry Wadsworth
Longfellow创作的名诗《Christmas Bells》。

2008年福音音乐团体Casting Crowns重新演绎了此曲，并获得了不错的成绩。

1800年代中期，Henry Wadsworth
Longfellow是家喻户晓的名字，但在1863年之后，他经历许多艰辛时刻，妻子死于大火、儿子查理（Charley）偷偷加入联盟军。那年12月初，Henry收到一封电报，儿子在战争中受伤，他花3天到那地找儿子，后被送往医疗机构，情况才渐渐稳定。圣诞节那天，儿子因发烧而发抖，恐怕无法康复。他在绝境下开始写诗，虽然他描述了自身所处的悲惨景况，但当中却又充满盼望。

儿子最后康复，并与父亲和好。而这首诗歌《Christmas Bells》至今仍带给身处绝境的人，看见希望。

### I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day歌词：

I heard the bells on Christmas Day  
Their old familiar carols play  
And mild and sweet their songs repeat  
Of peace on earth good will to men  
And the bells are ringing  
Like a choir they're singing  
In my heart I hear them  
Peace on earth good will to men  
And in despair I bowed my head  
There is no peace on earth I said  
For hate is strong and mocks the song  
Of peace on earth good will to men  
But the bells are ringing  
Like a choir singing  
Does anybody hear them  
Peace on earth good will to men  
Then rang the bells more loud and deep  
God is not dead nor doth He sleep  
The wrong shall fail the right prevail  
With peace on earth good will to men  
Then ringing singing on its way  
The world revolved from night to day  
A voice a chime a chant sublime  
Of peace on earth good will to men  
And the bells they're ringing  
Like a choir they're singing  
And with our hearts we'll hear them  
Peace on earth good will to men  
Do you hear the bells they're ringing  
The life the angels singing  
Open up your heart and hear them  
Peace on earth good will to men  
Peace on earth peace on earth  
Peace on earth good will to men
