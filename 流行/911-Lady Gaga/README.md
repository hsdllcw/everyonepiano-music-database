### 911歌词：

Turning up emotional faders  
Keep repeating self-hating phrases  
I have heard enough of these voices  
Almost like I have no choice  
This is biological stasis  
My mood's shifting too manic places  
Wish I laughed and kept the good friendships  
Watch life  
Here I go again  
I can't see me cry  
Can't see me cry ever again  
Ooo  
I can't see me cry  
Can't see me cry this is the end  
Ooo  
My biggest enemy is me  
Pop a 911  
My biggest enemy is me  
Pop a 911  
My biggest enemy is me  
Ever since day one  
Pop a 911  
Then pop another one  
Keep my dolls inside diamond boxes  
Save them 'til I know I'm gon' drop this  
Front I've felt me around me oasis  
Paradise is in my hand  
Holding on so tight to this status  
It's not real but I'll try to grab it  
Keep myself in beautiful places  
Paradise is in my hands  
I can't see me cry  
Can't see me cry ever again  
Ooo  
I can't see me cry  
Can't see me cry this is the end  
Ooo  
My biggest enemy is me  
Pop a 911  
My biggest enemy is me  
Pop a 911  
My biggest enemy is me  
Ever since day one  
Pop a 911  
Then pop another one  
Pop another one  
Pop a 911  
Then pop another one  
I can't see me cry  
Can't see me cry ever again  
Ooo  
I can't see me cry  
Can't see me cry this is the end  
Ooo  
My biggest enemy is me  
Pop a 911  
My biggest enemy is me  
Pop a 911  
My biggest enemy is me  
Ever since day one  
Pop a 911  
Then pop another one

Please patch the line  
Please patch the line  
Need a 911 can you patch the line
