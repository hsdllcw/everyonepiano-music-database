### Thank U, Next歌词：

Thought I'd end up with Sean  
But he wasn't a match  
Wrote some songs about Ricky  
Now I listen and laugh  
Even almost got married  
And for Pete  
I'm so thankful  
Wish I could say  
"Thank you" to Malcolm  
'Cause he was an angel  
One taught me love  
One taught me patience  
And one taught me pain  
Now I'm so amazing  
Say I've loved and I've lost  
But that's not what I see  
So look what I got  
Look what you taught me  
And for that I say  
Thank you, next next  
Thank you, next next  
Thank you, next  
I'm so f**kin' grateful for my ex  
Thank you, next next  
Thank you, next next  
Thank you, next next  
I'm so f**kin'  
Spend more time with my friends  
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'  
Plus I met someone else  
We havin' better discussions  
I know they say I move on too fast  
But this one gon' last  
'Cause her name is Ari  
And I'm so good with that  
So good with that  
She taught me love  
Love  
She taught me patience  
Patience  
How she handles pain  
Pain  
That sh*t's amazing  
Yeah she's amazing  
I've loved and I've lost  
Yeah yeah  
But that's not what I see  
Yeah yeah  
'Cause look what I've found  
Yeah yeah  
Ain't no need for searching  
And for that I say  
Thank you, next  
Thank you, next

Thank you, next  
Thank you, next  
Thank you, next  
I'm so f**king  
One day I'll walk down the aisle  
Holding hands with my mama  
I'll be thanking my dad  
'Cause she grew from the drama  
Only wanna do it once real bad  
Gon' make that sh*t last  
God forbid something happens  
Least this song is a smash  
Song is a smash  
I got so much love  
Love  
Got so much patience  
Patience  
I've learned from the pain  
Pain  
Turned out amazing  
Turned out amazing  
I've loved and I've lost  
Yeah yeah  
But that's not what I see  
Yeah yeah  
'Cause look what I've found  
Yeah yeah  
Ain't no need for searching  
And for that I say  
Thank you, next
