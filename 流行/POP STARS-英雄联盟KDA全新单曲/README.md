### POP/STARS歌词：

You know who it is  
Coming' round again  
You want a dose of this  
Right now  
It's K/DA uh  
I'm a goddess with a blade  
소리쳐봐 내 이름  
잊지 못하게  
Loud loud loud loud  
I could take it to the top  
절대 멈추지 못해  
내가 끝내주는  
Bad gal gal gal  
And when I start to talk like that like that  
Oh you won't know how to react  
I'm a picture perfect face  
With that wild in my veins  
You can hear it in my  
Growl growl growl growl  
So keep your eyes on me now  
무엇을 보든 좋아할 거야  
닿을 수 없는 level  
나와 대결 원한 널 확신해  
We gotta it all in our hands now  
So can you handle what we're all about  
We're so tough  
Not scared to show you up  
Can you feel the rush now  
Ain't nobody bringing us down down down  
Down down down  
They could try but we're gonna wear the crown  
You could go another round round round  
Round round round round  
Wish you luck but you're not bringing us down  
We go hard  
Till we get it get it  
We go hard  
We so in it in it  
We POP/STARS  
Only winning winning now  
Ain't nobody bringing us down down down down  
See 언제든지 내 모습 magic  
단 한 번에 내가 잡어  
절대 기죽지 않지 uh  
Pow pow 네가 뭘 알아  
견딜 수 없어 원해도  
원하는 게 얼굴에 보여  
I'm trouble and you're wanting it  
I'm so cold  
When I move that way  
You gonna be so blown  
I'm the realest in the game uh  
Say I'm on fire with a blade  
You're about to hear my name  
Ringing in your head like oh  
So keep your eyes on me now  
무엇을 보든 좋아할 거야  
We're so tough  
Not scared to show you up  
Can you feel the rush now  
Ain't nobody bringing us down down down  
Down down down  
They could try but we're gonna wear the crown  
You could go another round round round  
Round round round round  
Wish you luck but you're not bringing us down  
We go hard  
Till we get it get it  
We go hard  
We so in it in it  
We POP/STARS  
Only winning winning now  
Ain't nobody bringing us down down down down  
Ooh mm oh 난 멈추지 않아  
Oh oh we go hard  
Oh oh we POP/STARS stars  
Ain't nobody bringing us
