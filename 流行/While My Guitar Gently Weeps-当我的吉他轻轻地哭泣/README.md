### While My Guitar Gently Weeps歌词：

I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping  
While my guitar gently weeps  
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping  
Still my guitar gently weeps  
I don't know why nobody told you  
How to unfold your love  
I don't know how someone controlled you  
They bought and sold you  
I look at the world and I notice it's turning  
While my guitar gently weeps  
With every mistake we must surely be learning  
Still my guitar gently weeps  
I don't know how you were diverted  
You were perverted too  
I don't know how you were inverted  
No one alerted you  
I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping  
While my guitar gently weeps  
I look at you all  
Still my guitar gently weeps
