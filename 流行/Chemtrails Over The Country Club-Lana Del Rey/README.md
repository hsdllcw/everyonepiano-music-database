### Chemtrails Over The Country Club歌词：

I'm on the run with you my sweet love  
There's nothing wrong contemplating God  
Under the chemtrails over the country club  
We're in our jewels in the swimming pool  
Me and my sister just playin' it cool  
Under the chemtrails over the country club  
Take out your turquoise and all of your jewels  
Go to the market the kids' swimming pools  
Baby what's your sign  
My moon's in Leo my Cancer is sun  
You won't play you're no fun  
Well I don't care what they think  
Drag racing my little red sports car  
I'm not unhinged or unhappy I'm just wild  
I'm on the run with you my sweet love  
There's nothing wrong contemplating God  
Under the chemtrails over the country club  
We're in our jewels in the swimming pool  
Me and my sister just playin' it cool  
Under the chemtrails over the country club  
Meet you for coffee at the elementary schools  
We laugh about nothing as the summer gets cool  
It's beautiful LSD normality settles down over me  
I'm not bored or unhappy I'm still so strange and wild  
You're in the wind I'm in the water  
Nobody's son nobody's daughter  
Watching the chemtrails over the country club  
Suburbia The Brentwood Market  
What to do next Maybe we'll love it  
White picket chemtrails over the country club  
My love my love  
Washing my hair doing the laundry  
Late night TV I want you on me  
Like when we were kids under chemtrails and country clubs  
It's never too late baby so don't give up  
It's never too late baby so don't give up  
Under the chemtrails over the country club yeah  
You're born in December and I'm born in June  
Under the chemtrails over the country club yeah  
You're born in December and I'm born in June  
My Cancer is sun and my Leo is moon  
My Cancer is sun and my Leo is moon
