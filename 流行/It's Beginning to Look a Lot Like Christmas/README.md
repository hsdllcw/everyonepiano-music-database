### It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas歌词：

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
Everywhere you go  
Take a look at the five and ten  
It's glistening once again  
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow  
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
Toys in every store  
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be  
On your own front door  
A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots  
Is the wish of Barney and Ben  
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk  
Is the hope of Janice and Jen  
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again  
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
Everywhere you go  
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel one in the park as well  
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow  
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
Soon the bells will start  
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing  
Right within your heart  
A pair of hopalong boots and shootsa pistol that  
Is the wish of Barney and Ben  
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk  
Is the hope of Janice and Jen  
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again  
Ah ahh  
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
Soon the bells will start  
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing  
Right within your heart
