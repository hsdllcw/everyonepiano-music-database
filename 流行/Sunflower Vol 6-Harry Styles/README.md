### Sunflower, Vol. 6歌词：

Sunflower  
Sunflower my eyes want you more than a melody  
Let me inside  
Wish I could get to know you  
Sunflowers sometimes keep it sweet in your memory  
I was just tongue-tied  
I don't want to make you feel bad  
But I've been trying hard not to talk to you  
Sunflower sunflower sunflower  
I couldn't want you anymore  
Kiss in the kitchen like it's a dance floor  
I couldn't want you anymore  
Tonight  
Tonight tonight tonight  
Wondering headshake  
Tired eyes are the death of me mouth full of toothpaste  
Before I got to know you  
I've got your face hung up high in the gallery  
I love to say  
Sunflower sunflower  
Your flowers just died plant new seeds in the melody  
Let me inside I wanna get to know you  
I don't want to make you feel bad  
But I've been trying hard not to act a fool  
Sunflower sunflower sunflower  
I couldn't want you anymore  
Kiss in the kitchen like it's a dance floor  
I couldn't want you anymore  
Tonight  
Tonight tonight tonight  
I couldn't want you anymore  
Kids in the kitchen listen to dancehall  
I couldn't want you anymore  
Tonight  
Tonight tonight tonight  
Sunflower my eyes want you more than a melody  
Let me inside  
Wish I could get to know you  
Sunflowers just die keep it sweet in your memory  
I'm still tongue-tied  
Sunflower sunflower  
Sunflower sunflower  
Sunflower sunflower  
Ayy woo  
Woo woo woo woo  
Woo woo woo woo  
Woo woo woo woo  
Yeah  
Oooh wooo oh do do do do do do
