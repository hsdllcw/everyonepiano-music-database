**Older** 是美国歌手和词曲作者Ben Platt演唱的一首歌曲，收录在其首张录音室专辑Sing to Me Instead中。

Ben Platt真是有谜之吸引力，才25岁就拿过托尼奖和格莱美，不仅会唱，嗓音真挚还极具感染力，轻而易举就能戳中你的心，这首单曲《 _Older_
》也同样值得反复品味：当你年轻时，你希望赶紧长大，但当你真的老了，却祈盼时光能倒流。那种真实却又残酷的感觉，都被他这样直截了当地唱出来了……

### Older歌词：

I was walking down 57th street towards park  
With the same old song in my same old heart  
Making plans I'm gonna do when I get older  
Passed a gray-haired man and I found his eyes  
It's like he knew my thoughts and he read my mind  
Saying life is gonna find you when it's supposed to  
Felt my feet stop short and I turned my head  
Tried to lean into every word he said  
Then he said  
When you are younger  
You'll wish you're older  
Then when you're older  
You'll wish for time to turn around  
Don't let your wonder turn into closure  
When you get older  
When you get older  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Have I killed my thoughts right before their prime  
Have I bit my tongue one too many times  
Have I said it all the way I really meant to  
If I wait 'til my tomorrow comes  
Is the waiting all I've ever done  
And will I get to  
Get to know myself in the place I am  
Get to fall in love with another man and understand  
When you are younger  
You'll wish you're older  
Then when you're older  
You'll wish for time to turn around  
Don't let your wonder turn into closure  
When you get older  
When you get older  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
When you are younger  
When you are younger  
You'll wish you're older  
You'll wish you're older  
When you get older  
When you get older  
You'll wish for time to turn around  
Don't let your wonder  
Don't let your wonder  
Turn into closure turn into closure  
When you get older  
When you get older  
When you get older  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh
