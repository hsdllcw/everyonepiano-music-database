**Call My Friends** 是加拿大创作歌手Shawn Mendes推出的第四张录音室专辑《Wonder》中的第六支单曲。

这首歌是Mendes在结束全球巡演时，在Malibu时创作的。他觉得这首歌是整张专辑里最让人兴奋的歌之一，也是整个专辑最早写的。而且歌词也表达了当时Mendes在外巡演的三个月不能与家人朋友相聚的心情。

### Call My Friends歌词：

Right now I'm alone inside the airport  
And you're all at a bar in our hometown  
Feels like we been living different lives  
The music's loud and everybody's dancing  
How many nights I've missed yeah I've lost count  
Haven't seen your faces in a while  
I should call my friends  
I should call my friends and go get high  
I need a vacation from my mind  
I wanna go nobody knows me better than them  
Wanna feel something again  
I should call my friends  
I don't wanna miss another birthday  
Feels like it's been forever since nineteen  
I just wanna be right where you are  
I miss how it was when we wished we were older  
Feeling so far when I wanna be closer  
I should call my friends  
I should call my friends and go get high  
I need a vacation from my mind  
I wanna go nobody knows me better than them  
Wanna feel something again  
I should call my friends  
Ooh I know you gotta make some sacrifices  
Ooh I don't wanna be alone for one more night  
Ooh I know you gotta make some sacrifices  
I should call my friends  
I should call my friends  
I should call my friends and go get high  
I need a vacation from my mind  
I wanna go nobody knows me better than them  
Wanna feel something again  
I should call my friends
