### Leave the Door Open歌词：

What you doin'  
What you doin'  
Where you at  
Where you at  
Oh you got plans  
You got plans  
Don't say that  
Shut yo trap  
I'm sippin' wine  
Sip sip  
In a robe  
Drip drip  
I look too good  
Look too good  
To be alone  
Wooohooo  
My house clean  
House clean  
My pool warm  
Pool warm  
Just shaved  
Smooth like a new born  
We should be dancing romancing  
In the east wing and the west wing  
Of this mansion what's happenin  
I ain't playin' no games  
Every word that I say  
Is coming straight from the heart  
So if you tryna lay in these arms  
I'mma leave the door open  
I'mma leave the door open  
I'mma leave the door open girl  
I'mma leave the door open hopin'  
That you feel the way I feel  
And you want me like I want you tonight baby  
Tell me that you're coming through  
You're so sweet  
So sweet  
So tight  
So tight  
I won't bite  
Ahh ahh  
Unless you like  
Unless you like  
If you smoke  
What you smoke  
I got that haze  
Purple haze  
And if you're hungry girl I got filets  
Woohooo  
Ooh baby don't keep me waiting  
There's so much love we could be making  
I'm talking kissing cuddling  
Rose pedals in the bathtub  
Let's jump in its bubblin'  
I ain't playin' no games  
Every word that I say  
Is coming straight from the heart  
So if you tryna lay in these arms  
I'mma leave the door open  
I'mma leave the door open  
I'mma leave the door open girl  
I'mma leave the door open hopin'  
That you feel the way I feel  
And you want me like I want you tonight baby  
Tell me that you're coming through  
La la laaa la la la la la  
I need you baby  
La la laaa la la la la  
I gotta see you baby  
La la laaa la la la la  
Girl I'm tryna give you this  
Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh  
I'mma leave the door open  
I'mma leave the door open  
I'mma leave I'mma leave the door open girl  
I'mma leave the door open hopin'  
That you feel the way I feel  
And you want me like I want you tonight baby  
Tell me that you're coming through  
Tell me  
Tell me that you're coming through  
Tell me that you're coming through  
Girl I'm here just waiting for you  
Come on over I'll adore you  
Girl gotta know  
I'm waiting waiting waiting for you  
Tell me that you're coming through  
Girl I'm here just waiting for you  
Come on over I'll adore you
