《 **Matilda** 》出自英国男歌手Harry Styles的第三张录音室专辑《Harry's House》，于2022年5月20日发行。

专辑有一种亲友间在家私密对谈般轻松、坦诚的氛围，就像把心中所想唱成歌。曾经有朋友向 Harry 诉衷肠，于是他借英国童话大师 Roald Dahl
笔下的人物《 _Matilda_
》，来表达对朋友的支持：“我想帮到你，想支持你。而有时候，一切只在于倾听。我希望通过这首歌，我能表达清楚这一点：‘我在倾听你的话。’”

### Matilda歌词：

You were riding your bike to the sound of it's no big deal  
And you're trying to lift off the ground on those old two wheels  
Nothing about the way  
That you were treated ever seemed especially alarming 'til now  
So you tie up your hair and you smile like it's no big deal  
You can let it go  
You can throw a party full of everyone you know  
And not invite your family  
Cause they never showed you love  
You don't have to be sorry for leaving and growing up  
Matilda you talk of the pain like it's all alright  
But I know that you feel like a piece of you's dead inside  
You showed me a power that is strong enough  
To bring sun to the darkest days  
It's none of my business but it's just been on my mind  
You can let it go  
You can throw a party full of everyone you know  
And not invite your family  
Cause they never showed you love  
You don't have to be sorry for leaving and growing up  
You can see the world  
Following the seasons  
Anywhere you go  
You don't need a reason  
Cause they never showed you love  
You don't have to be sorry for doing it on your own  
You're just in time  
Make your tea and your toast  
You framed all your posters and dyed your clothes  
You don't have to go  
You don't have to go home  
Oh there's a long way to go  
I don't believe that time will change your mind  
In other words  
I know they won't hurt you anymore as long as you can let them go  
You can let it go  
You can throw a party full of everyone you know  
You can start a family who will always show you love  
You don't have to be sorry for doing it on your own  
You can let it go  
You can throw a party full of everyone you know  
You can start a family who will always show you love  
You don't have to be sorry no
