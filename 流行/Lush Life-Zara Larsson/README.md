### Lush Life歌词：

I live my day as if it was the last  
Live my day as if there was no past  
Doin' it all night, all summer  
Doin' it the way I wanna

Yeah I'mma dance my heart out 'til the dawn  
But I won't be done when morning comes  
Doin' it all night, all summer  
Gonna spend it like no other

It was a crush  
But I couldn't, couldn't get enough  
It was a rush  
But I gave it up

It was a crush  
Now I might have went and said too much  
But that's all it was  
So I gave it up

I live my day as if it was the last  
Live my day as if there was no past  
Doin' it all night, all summer  
Doin' it the way I wanna

Yeah I'mma dance my heart out 'til the dawn  
But I won't be done when morning comes  
Doin' it all night, all summer  
Gonna spend it like no other

It was a crush  
I kept saying I'mma stay in touch  
But that thing went bust  
So I gave it up

No tricks, no bluff  
I'm just better off without them cuffs  
Yeah, the sun won't set on us

Went low, went high  
Still waters run dry  
Gotta get back in the groove  
I ain't ever worry

Went low, went high  
What matters is now  
Getting right back in the mood

I live my day as if it was the last  
Live my day as if there was no past  
Doin' it all night, all summer  
Doin' it the way I wanna

Yeah I'mma dance my heart out 'til the dawn  
But I won't be done when morning comes  
Doin' it all night, all summer  
Gonna spend it like no other

Now I've found another crush  
The lush life's given me a rush  
Had one chance to make me blush  
Second time is one too late

Now I've found another crush  
The lush life's given me a rush  
Had one chance to make me blush  
Second time is one too late

I live my day as if it was the last  
Live my day as if there was no past  
Doin' it all night, all summer  
Doin' it the way I wanna

Yeah I'mma dance my heart out 'til the dawn  
But I won't be done when morning comes  
Doin' it all night, all summer  
Gonna spend it like no other

Now I've found another crush  
The lush life's given me a rush  
Had one chance to make me blush  
Second time is one too late

Now I've found another crush  
The lush life's given me a rush  
Had one chance to make me blush  
Second time is one too late
