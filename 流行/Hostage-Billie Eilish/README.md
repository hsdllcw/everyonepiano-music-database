### Hostage歌词：

I wanna be alone  
Alone with you does that make sense  
I wanna steal your soul  
And hide you in my treasure chest  
I don't know what to do  
To do with your kiss on my neck  
I don't know what feels true  
But this feels right so stay a sec  
Yeah you feel right so stay a sec  
And let me crawl inside your veins  
I'll build a wall give you a ball and chain  
It's not like me to be so mean  
You're all I wanted  
Just let me hold you like a hostage  
Gold on your fingertips  
Fingertips against my cheek  
Gold leaf across your lips  
Kiss me until I can't speak  
Gold chain beneath your shirt  
The shirt that you let me wear home  
Gold's fake and real love hurts  
And nothing hurts when I'm alone  
When you're with me and we're alone  
And let me crawl inside your veins  
I'll build a wall give you a ball and chain  
It's not like me to be so mean  
You're all I wanted  
Just let me hold you  
Hold you like a hostage  
Like a hostage
