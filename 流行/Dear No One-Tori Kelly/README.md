### Dear No One歌词：

I like being independent  
Not so much of an investment  
No one to tell me what to do  
I like being by myself  
Don't gotta entertain anybody else  
No one to answer to...

But sometimes, I just want somebody to hold  
Someone to give me the jacket when it's cold  
Got that young love even when we're old  
Yeah sometimes, I want someone to grab my hand  
Pick me up, pull me close, be my man  
I will love you till the end

So if you're out there I swear to be good to you  
But I'm done lookin', for my future someone  
Cause when the time is right  
You'll be here, but for now  
Dear no one, this is your love song  
Ooo-OhOh

I don't really like big crowds  
I tend to shut people out  
I like my space, yeah  
But I'd love to have a soulmate  
And God'll give him to me someday  
And I know it'll be worth the wait, oh

So if you're out there I swear to be good to you  
But I'm done lookin' (But I'm done lookin'), for my future someone  
Cause when the time is right  
You'll be here, but for now  
Dear no one (Dear nobody) this is your love song (Ooo-Oooh)

Sometimes, I just want somebody to hold  
Someone to give me the jacket when it's cold  
Got that young love even when we're old  
Yeah sometimes, I want someone to grab my hand  
Pick me up, pull me close, be my man  
I will love you till the end

So if you're out there I swear to be good to you  
But I'm done lookin' (I'm done lookin'), for my future someone (Ooo-Yeah)  
Cause when the time is right  
You'll be here, but for now  
Dear no one (Dear Nobody) this is your love song (This is your love song)  
Dear no one, no need to be searchin', no  
Dear no one...  
Dear no one...  
Dear No one, this is your love song
