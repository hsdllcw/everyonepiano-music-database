### King of My Heart歌词：

I'm perfectly fine I live on my own  
I made up my mind I'm better off bein' alone  
We met a few weeks ago  
Now you try on callin' me baby like tryin' on clothes  
Salute to me I'm your American Queen  
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat  
And we rule the kingdom inside my room  
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars  
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars  
Never took me quite where you do  
And all at once you are the one I have been waiting for  
King of my heart body and soul ooh whoa  
And all at once you're all I want I'll never let you go  
King of my heart body and soul ooh whoa  
And all at once I've been waiting waiting  
Ooh whoa ooh whoa  
And all at once you are the one I have been waiting waiting  
Body and soul ooh whoa  
And all at once  
Late in the night the city's asleep  
Your love is a secret I'm hoping dreaming dying to keep  
Change my priorities  
The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury  
Salute to me I'm your American Queen  
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat  
And we rule the kingdom inside my room  
Inside my room oh  
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars  
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars  
Never took me quite where you do  
Where you do  
And all at once you are the one I have been waiting for  
King of my heart body and soul ooh whoa  
And all at once you're all I want I'll never let you go  
King of my heart body and soul ooh whoa  
And all at once I've been waiting waiting  
Ooh whoa ooh whoa  
And all at once you are the one I have been waiting waiting  
Body and soul ooh whoa  
And all at once  
Is this the end of all the endings  
My broken bones are mending  
With all these nights we're spending  
Up on the roof with a school girl crush  
Drinking beer out of plastic cups  
Say you fancy me not fancy stuff  
Baby all at once this is enough  
And all at once you are the one I have been waiting for  
King of my heart body and soul ooh whoa  
And all at once you are the one I have been waiting for  
King of my heart body and soul ooh whoa  
And all at once you're all I want I'll never let you go  
King of my heart body and soul ooh whoa  
And all at once I've been waiting waiting  
Ooh whoa ooh whoa  
And all at once 'cause you're the one I have been waiting waiting  
Body and soul ooh whoa  
And all at once
