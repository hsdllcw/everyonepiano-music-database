**Solo双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Solo_ 此曲出自美国青年歌手Demi Lovato的第二张个人录音室专辑《Here We Go Again》。这张专辑整体依旧延续了Demi之前Pop
rock和 Power
pop的风格，加入了R&B和Synthpop(合成流行乐)元素，歌词也从青涩转向成熟，整张专辑更有韵味。且该专辑首周销量超过108,000张，夺得美国公告牌专辑榜Billboard
200 No. 1好成绩。

### Solo歌词：

You speak to me  
And in your words I hear a melody  
But in the twilight it's so hard to see  
What's wrong for me

I can't resist  
Until you give the truth a little twist  
As if you're gonna get away with this  
You're not sorry

I can't believe I fell for this

I fell through the hole  
Down at the bottom of your soul  
Didn't think you could go  
So low  
Look at what you've done  
You're losing me  
Here's what you've won  
Got me planning to go  
Solo  
Solo

You sing to me  
Too bad you couldn't even stay on key  
If your life is such a mystery  
Why don't you stick to acting?

Here you go again  
You couldn't find my number until when  
You thought that you could get to my best friend  
Without a script your game is lacking

I can't believe I fell for this

I fell through the hole  
Down at the bottom of your soul  
Didn't think you could go  
So low  
Look at what you've done  
You're losing me  
Here's what you've won  
Got me planning to go  
Solo  
Solo

I'd rather go to a party alone  
Than have to walk around with you on my arm  
Now that i'm proud to admit that we're done  
Good luck trying to find me....

'Cause I didn't think you could go  
So low  
Look at what you've done  
You're losing me  
Here's what you've won "  
Got me planning to go  
Solo  
Every day  
'Cause you got me planning to go  
Solo  
Solo
