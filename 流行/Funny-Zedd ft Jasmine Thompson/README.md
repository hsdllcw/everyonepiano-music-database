### Funny歌词：

The curtains are closed now  
Nothing to see  
But a dozen dying roses at our feet  
Your timing is perfect  
Ironic to me  
Showing up the moment that you shouldn't be  
Last time I checked  
You're the one that left  
Last words you said  
That you couldn't care less  
It's funny how you miss me more than you could ever love me  
How you couldn't give me everything and now you want it from me  
Yeah it's funny how it's different now that I got somebody  
Yeah it's funny  
Ooo  
It's funny how you're calling couldn't answer if I wanted  
Cause his lips are on my lips and both my hands are on his body  
Yeah it's funny how it's different now that I got somebody  
Yeah it's funny  
Ooo  
Sending a message  
Through mutual friends  
It's like I'm talking to you using them  
You heard I was happy  
And I heard you're not  
I guess freedom didn't free you like you thought  
Last time I checked  
You're the one that left  
Last words you said  
That you couldn't care less  
It's funny how you miss me more than you could ever love me  
How you couldn't give me everything and now you want it from me  
Yeah it's funny how it's different now that I got somebody  
Yeah it's funny  
Ooo  
It's funny how you're calling couldn't answer if I wanted  
Cause his lips are on my lips and both my hands are on his body  
Yeah it's funny how it's different now that I got somebody  
Yeah it's funny  
Ooo  
It's funny how you miss me more than you could ever love me  
How you couldn't give me everything and now you want it from me  
Yeah it's funny how it's different now that I got somebody  
Yeah it's funny  
Ooo  
It's funny how you're calling couldn't answer if I wanted  
Cause his lips are on my lips and both my hands are on his body  
Yeah it's funny how it's different now that I got somebody  
Yeah it's funny  
Ooo  
It's funny how you're calling couldn't answer if I wanted  
Cause his lips are on my lips and both my hands are on his body  
Yeah it's funny how it's different now that I got somebody  
Yeah it's funny  
Ooo  
Who's laughing now  
Who's laughing now  
Ooo  
Who's laughing now  
Who's laughing now  
Ooo
