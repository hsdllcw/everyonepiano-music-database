### Wheels on the Bus歌词：

I'm just looking out the window and it's cold outside  
There are two boys yelling behind me and I'm terrified  
Counting trees as they pass me by  
And I'm trying not to look across the aisle  
'Cause Maya's letting Dan put his hand up her skirt  
And she's got her hand down his pants  
I know the driver sees it  
I know he's peeking in the rearview mirror  
He says nothing  
Trying to ignore it it's f**king boring  
I'm quietly observing I'm saying nothing  
No one's watching us don't give a f**k  
Wheels on the bus  
I'm holding it down up in the front  
Wheels on the bus  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Wheels on the bus  
Now I'ma light it up and pass it  
Puff puff and pass it  
Don't be a d**k and baby say  
Come on just pass it over here  
Counting cars as they pass me by  
And I'm trying not to look a row behind me  
'Cause Jason's got his a*s on the glass  
And I hate him driver hit a bump fast  
I know the driver sees it  
I know he's peeking in the rearview mirror  
He says nothing  
Trying to ignore it it's f**king boring  
I'm quietly observing I'm saying nothing  
No one's watching us don't give a f**k  
Wheels on the bus  
I'm holding it down up in the front  
Wheels on the bus  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Wheels on the bus  
Ooh ooh oh ooh  
Wheels on the on the bus  
Ooh ha ooh oh ooh ooh  
Wheels on the bus  
No one's watching us don't give a f**k  
Wheels on the bus  
I'm holding it down up in the front  
Wheels on the bus  
Ooh  
Wheels on the bus  
Ooh  
Wheels on the bus  
Ooh  
Wheels on the bus
