**Mirrorball** 是由美国女歌手Taylor
Swift录唱的一首歌曲，被收录在Taylor于2020年7月24日发行的第八张录音室专辑《Folklore》，为其所属专辑中的第6首歌曲。且此曲空降在2020年8月8日的公告牌百强单曲榜的第26位。

这首歌曲的词和旋律真的浪漫到流泪。看着词听完一遍脑海里就有画面了：黑暗中的巨大舞台，舞台上有个舞者，幕布上的镜面球旋转着散发出一束束闪耀的光芒，台上的舞者也一圈圈旋转着，但散发出的不是光芒，是一段段浪漫的记忆和火热的爱意。身体自由轻灵的舞动，灵魂浪漫火热的旋转，永远不会熄灭。全专最爱。

### Mirrorball歌词：

I want you to know  
I'm a mirrorball  
I'll show you every version of yourself tonight  
I'll get you out on the floor  
Shimmering beautiful  
And when I break it's in a million pieces  
Hush  
When no one is around my dear  
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes  
Spinning in my highest heels love  
Shining just for you  
Hush  
I know they said the end is near  
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes  
Spinning in my highest heels love  
Shining just for you  
I want you to know  
I'm a mirrorball  
I can change everything about me to fit in  
You are not like the regulars  
The masquerade revelers  
Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten  
Hush  
When no one is around my dear  
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes  
Spinning in my highest heels love  
Shining just for you  
Hush  
I know they said the end is near  
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes  
Spinning in my highest heels love  
Shining just for you  
And they called off the circus  
Burned the disco down  
When they sent home the horses  
And the rodeo clowns  
I'm still on that tightrope  
I'm still trying everything  
to get you laughing at me  
I'm still a believer  
But I don't know why  
I've never been a natural  
All I do is try try try  
I'm still on that trapeze  
I'm still trying everything  
To keep you looking at me  
Because I'm a mirrorball  
I'm a mirrorball  
I'll show you every version of yourself  
Tonight
