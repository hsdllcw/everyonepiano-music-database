### One Dance歌词：

[Intro - Kyla & Wizkid:]  
Baby, I like your style

[Verse 1 - Drake:]  
Grips on your waist  
Front way, back way  
You know that I don't play  
Streets not safe  
But I never run away  
Even when I'm away  
Oti, oti, there's never much love when we go, oti  
I pray to make it back in one piece  
I pray, I pray

[Hook - Drake:]  
That's why I need a one dance  
Got a Hennessy in my hand  
One more time 'fore I go  
Higher powers taking a hold on me  
I need a one dance  
Got a Hennessy in my hand  
One more time 'fore I go  
Higher powers taking a hold on me

[Bridge - Kyla & Wizkid:]  
Baby, I like your style

[Verse 2 - Drake:]  
Strength and guidance  
All that I'm wishing for my friends  
Nobody makes it from my ends  
I had to bust up the silence  
You know you gotta stick by me  
Soon as you see the text, reply me  
I don't wanna spend time fighting  
We've got no time

[Hook - Drake:]  
And that's why I need a one dance  
Got a Hennessy in my hand  
One more time 'fore I go  
Higher powers taking a hold on me  
I need a one dance  
Got a Hennessy in my hand  
One more time 'fore I go  
Higher powers taking a hold on me

[Break - Wizkid:]  
Got a pretty girl and she love me long time  
Wine it, wine it, very long time  
Oh, yeah, she steady on grindin'  
Back up, back up, back up and wine it  
Back up, back up and wine it  
Back up, back up, back up and wine it  
Oh, yeah, she steady on grindin'  
Back up, back up and wine it, girl

[Bridge - Kyla & Wizkid:]  
Tell me now, I need to know, where do you wanna go?  
'Cause if you're down, I'll take it slow  
Make you lose control  
Where, where, where  
Where, where, where, where  
Oh, yeah, she steady on grindin'  
Where, where, where  
Back up, back up and wine it, girl  
Where, where, where, where  
'Cause if you're down  
Back up, back up and  
'Cause if you're down  
Back up, back up and  
'Cause if you're down  
Back up, back up and

[Hook - Drake:]  
I need a one dance  
Got a Hennessy in my hand  
One more time 'fore I go  
Higher powers taking a hold on me  
I need a one dance  
Got a Hennessy in my hand  
One more time 'fore I go  
Higher powers taking a hold on me
