### Lego house歌词：

I'm gonna pick up the pieces and build a Lego house  
If things go wrong we can knock it down  
My three words have two meanings but there's one thing on my mind  
It's all for you

And it's dark in a cold December, but I've got you to keep me warm  
If you're broken I will mend ya and keep you sheltered from the storm that's
raging on, now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love  
I'll pick you up when you're getting down  
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now  
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind  
I'll do it all for you in time  
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now, now

I'm gonna paint you by numbers and colour you in  
If things go right we can frame it and put you on a wall  
And it's so hard to say it but I've been here before  
Now I'll surrender up my heart and swap it for yours

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love  
I'll pick you up when you're getting down  
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now  
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind  
I'll do it all for you in time  
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now

Don't hold me down, I think the braces are breaking and it's more than I can
take

And it's dark in a cold December, but I've got you to keep me warm  
If you're broken I will mend ya and keep you sheltered from the storm that's
raging on, now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love  
I'll pick you up when you're getting down  
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now  
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind,  
I'll do it all for you in time  
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now  
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love  
I'll pick you up when you're getting down

[Album version ending:]  
And out of all these things I've done, I will love you better now

[Music video version ending:]  
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now

I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind  
I'll do it all for you in time  
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now  
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love  
I'll pick you up when you're getting down  
And out of all these things I've done I will love you better now
