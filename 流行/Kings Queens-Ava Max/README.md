### Kings & Queens歌词：

If all of the kings had their queens on the throne  
We would pop champagne and raise a toast  
To all of the queens who are fighting alone  
Baby you're not dancing on your own  
Can't live without me you wanna  
But you can't nah nah nah  
Think it's funny but honey  
Can't run this show on your own  
I can feel my body shake  
There's only so much I can take  
I'll show you how a real queen behaves  
No damsel in distress don't need to save me  
Once I start breathing fire you can't tame me  
And you might think I'm weak without a sword  
But if I had one it'd be bigger than yours  
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne  
We would pop champagne and raise a toast  
To all of the queens who are fighting alone  
Baby you're not dancing on your own  
Disobey me then baby  
It's off with your head  
Gonna change it and make it  
A world you won't forget  
No damsel in distress don't need to save me  
Once I start breathing fire you can't tame me  
And you might think I'm weak without a sword  
But I'm stronger than I ever was before  
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne  
We would pop champagne and raise a toast  
To all of the queens who are fighting alone  
Baby you're not dancing on your own  
In chess the king can move one space at a time  
But queens are free to go wherever they like  
You get too close you'll get a royalty high  
So breathe it in to feel the life  
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne  
We would pop champagne and raise a toast  
To all of the queens who are fighting alone  
Baby you're not dancing on your own
