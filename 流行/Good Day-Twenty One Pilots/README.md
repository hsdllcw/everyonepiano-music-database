### Good Day歌词：

I can feel my saturation leaving me slowly  
Broke the news on Mom's vacation  
Oh but you know me  
Low-key I'm alright  
Would you say you depend on the weather  
My sunshine is a buzz and a light I'll be singing out  
I know it's hard to believe me it's a good day  
Lost my job my wife and child  
Homie just sued me  
Shoot my life in shoot 'em up style  
Her favorite movies  
Low-key I'm alright  
Would you say you depend on the weather  
My sunshine is a buzz and a light I'll be singing out  
I know it's hard to believe me it's a good day  
Today's a good day  
Never know never know  
When the next one will show it'll show  
So I'mma sing my soul I'mma sing my soul  
Today's a good day  
Never know never know  
When the next one will show it'll show  
So I'ma sing my soul I'ma sing my soul yeah  
So I'ma sing my soul I'ma sing my soul  
I'm alright  
Would you say you depend on the weather  
My sunshine is a buzz and a light I'll be singing out  
I know it's hard to believe me it's a good day  
I'm alright  
I'm alright  
I think that I'm alright  
It's a good day
