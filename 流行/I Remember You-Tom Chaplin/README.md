### I Remember You歌词：

I, I remember you  
You are really me  
Standing in the sea  
Watching as the waves  
End your happy days  
Many moons ago  
And longer than you know

Yeah if I close my eyes  
I can see you fighting in the tide  
And it's so hard to let the memory die  
So I just wanna know if you're alright

And so, I build a big machine  
It's cleverer than I, I could ever dream  
I get inside and I'm  
Traveling through time  
Stepping out the door  
I find I'm by the shore

I don't believe my eyes  
But somehow you are standing at my side  
It's good to know that you are still alive

Cos I remember you  
You are really me  
Drowning in the sea  
Swallowed by the rush of the rising tide  
Tethered to a rock  
Picking at a lock  
All the while the fire inside you dies  
So what else can I do  
But remember you  
Yeah

Cos I remember you  
You are really me  
Drowning in the sea  
Swallowed by the rush of the rising tide  
Tethered to a rock  
Picking at a lock  
All the while the fire inside you dies  
So what else can I do  
But remember you  
Yeah

So what else can I do  
But remember you  
Yeah
