Laid up got me thinking babe  
Tell me if you with it 'cause I'm with it babe  
I haven't heard from you in a minute babe  
Just tell me what to do when I hit it babe  
Gucci I'm parked up  
Trips to your crib in the middle of the night  
I know that you miss me as I put it down right  
D**n babe I can put you on a flight  
You know that a n***a like me can change your life
