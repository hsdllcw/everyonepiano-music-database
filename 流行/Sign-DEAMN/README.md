**Sign双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Sign_
是歌手DEAMN演唱的歌曲。欢快的旋律伴着清脆的响指，让人忍不住继续听下去。专辑制作者虽然是DEAMN，但是这首歌曲的大部分却是一个不知名的女声。但不得不说DEAMN的旋律和这个女声真的绝配。

### Sign歌词：

trying to forget you  
i'm all alone  
in a ghost town  
there's a beautiful madness  
inside my soul  
and i can't stop  
thinking of you  
walking on a lonely avenue  
are you? are you? are you?  
my love is so wild  
please give me a sign  
my love is so wild  
please give me, baby  
my love is so wild  
please give me a sign  
my love is so wild  
please give me a sign  
please give me a sign  
fading in the dark  
all the lights  
go down  
i'm feeling high and drunk  
close my eyes  
and i can't stop  
thinking of you  
walking on a lonely avenue  
are you? are you? are you?  
my love is so wild  
please give me a sign  
my love is so wild  
please give me, baby  
my love is so wild  
please give me a sign  
my love is so wild  
please give me a sign  
my love is so wild  
please give me a sign  
my love is so wild  
please give me, baby  
my love is so wild  
please give me a sign  
my love is so wild  
please give me a sign
