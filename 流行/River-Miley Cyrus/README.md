### River歌词：

I got a new dress just to meet you downtown  
Can you walk me through the park just to show it off  
I can pull my hair back in that tight way that you like  
If you wrap me in your arms and never stop  
Heart beats so loud that is drownin' me out  
Livin' in an April shower  
You're pourin' down baby drown me out  
Ooh ooh ooh  
You're just like a river  
Ooh ooh ooh  
You're just like a river  
Ooh ooh ooh  
You go on forever  
You're just like a river  
Blowing bubbles in the bath I can't stop from thinking lately  
You could be the one have the honor of my babies  
Hope they have your eyes and that crooked smile  
Was a desert 'fore I met you I was in a drought  
Heart beats so loud that is drownin' me out  
Livin' in an April shower  
You're pourin' down baby drown me out  
Ooh ooh ooh  
You're just like a river  
Ooh ooh ooh  
You're just like a river  
Ooh ooh ooh  
You go on forever  
You're just like a river  
You're never runnin' dry  
Oh  
I feel you everywhere  
Your face is all in my hair  
Hair  
Covered up in your sweat  
It turns me on that you care baby  
Your love it flows just like a river  
You're just like a river  
That's what you are  
You're just like a river  
That's what you are  
You're just like a river  
That's what you are  
You're just like a river  
You're just like a river  
Heart beats so loud that is drownin' me out  
You're just like a river  
Livin' in an April shower  
You go on forever  
You're pourin' down baby drown me out  
You're just like a river
