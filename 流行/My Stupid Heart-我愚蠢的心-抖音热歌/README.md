萌娃来袭，国外某音上大热的洗脑歌《 **My Stupid Heart** 》（我愚蠢的心）！这是加拿大独立流行乐队Walk off the
Earth的单曲。这首歌真的好欢快，音乐真的可以感染一个人的心情。

而在发行之前，Walk off the
Earth率先释出了由主唱Gianni与Sarah三个儿子演绎的版本，分别是9岁的老大Giorgio、7岁的老二Luigi跟5岁的老幺Romeo，他们可爱又自信的表演吸引了将近300万人点赞。

可以说，这些萌娃把父母的歌唱火了！

相比原版歌曲，纯真童声助阵的版本更成功地引起了网络风潮。由Walk Off The Earth乐团成员的三个孩子组成的儿童团体Luminati
Suns，他们在油管中现场演唱这首歌。流畅抓耳的旋律因童趣的人声而变得更有活力和新鲜感，很快这个版本便风靡了短视频平台。

### My Stupid Heart歌词：

Hey everybody  
My mom 'n dad made this new song called My Stupid Heart  
I'm gonna play it with my brothers  
Let's go  
My stupid heart  
Don't know  
I've tried to let you go  
So many times before  
Then wound up at your door  
My stupid  
Can't believe that I haven't figured out by now  
Every time I call you up  
All you do is let me down  
Should have known there was nothing about us I could change  
Every time we try to be friends it always ends the same  
But when I try to remember  
All the pain that we've been through  
Something in me says "whatever"  
And it brings me back to you  
My stupid heart  
Don't know  
I've tried to let you go  
So many times before  
Then wound up at your door  
My stupid heart  
Too late  
Already on my way  
If we go down in flames  
Again then you can blame my stupid heart heart heart  
Oh oh  
Okay  
Okay  
Again then you can blame my stupid heart  
Oh oh  
Okay  
Okay  
Again then you can blame my stupid  
Every now and then I get inside my head  
Try to leave your text unread  
But I wind up here instead  
I should have bit my tongue while we were still ahead  
Yeah I always had to be right  
'Til we had nothing left  
But when I try to remember  
All the pain that we've been through  
Something in me says "whatever"  
And it brings me back to you  
My stupid heart  
Don't know  
I've tried to let you go  
So many times before  
Then wound up at your door  
My stupid heart  
Too late  
Already on my way  
If we go down in flames  
Again then you can blame my stupid heart heart heart  
Oh oh  
Okay  
Okay  
Again then you can blame my stupid heart  
I've tried to let you go  
So many times before  
You can blame my stupid heart  
Already on my way  
If we go down in flames  
Again then you can blame my stupid heart  
Too late  
Already on my way  
If we go down in flames  
Again then you can blame my stupid heart
