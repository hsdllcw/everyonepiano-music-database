_You Know I'll Go Get_ 是印尼女DJ Haning与Rizky
Ayuba一同合作的单曲。此曲带着一点点如同印尼这个神奇国度的味道，很上头。

一如既往的全歌节奏把握和电音的跳动带着丝丝喜感，电音的节奏其实已经有点偏于DJ打碟的方式，甚至隐隐约约都能看见说唱的影子穿插在全歌中。男音阳光，清澈，听起来让人感觉到如沐春阳。电音打碟的穿插其实并不会让人感觉突兀，反而莫名的感觉有一种越听越上头的感觉。听这首歌仿佛会感觉身处印尼的街头，那种奇妙的感觉让这首歌欲罢不能的一遍又一遍的循环！

### You Know I'll Go Get歌词：

You know I'll go get you yeah  
Whatever it takes to get there  
Know I won't drop you  
Like everybody else does  
Forget about your friends they don't care where we go  
If they do we'll get lost in a crowd of people  
I've been lookin' for you forever baby  
We go together baby we go we go  
In this crazy world of choices I know we got a few  
Either you're comin' with me or I'm comin' with you  
'Cause I finally found I finally found you  
You never have to worry if what I say is true  
Girl I've been lookin' for you  
And when I saw you I knew  
That I'd finally found I'd finally found you  
Rizky Ayuba  
We make  
You know I'll go get  
Rizky Ayuba  
We make  
Make some noise  
Make some noise  
You know I'll go get you yeah  
Whatever it takes to get there  
Know I won't drop you  
Like everybody else does  
Forget about your friends they don't care where we go  
If they do we'll get lost in a crowd of people  
I've been lookin' for you forever baby  
We go together baby we go we go  
In this crazy world of choices I know we got a few  
Either you're comin' with me or I'm comin' with you  
'Cause I finally found I finally found you  
You never have to worry if what I say is true  
Girl I've been lookin' for you  
And when I saw you I knew  
That I'd finally found I'd finally found you  
Rizky Ayuba  
We make  
You know I'll go get  
Rizky Ayuba  
We make  
Make some noise  
Make some noise
