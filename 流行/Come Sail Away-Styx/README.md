**Come Sail Away** 是美国摇滚乐队Styx的歌曲。

  
Styx可说是70年代最具代表性的摇滚象征之一，"Baby"、"Lady"、" _Come Sail Away_ "、"Don’t Let It
End"、"Mr. Roberto"等均是流传许久的经典佳构，其中两位灵魂人物-键盘手兼主唱Dennis De Young及吉它手Tommy
Shaw，不但塑造了高比重吉它与键盘的招牌风格，其成功的个人生涯(前者曾以"Desert Moon"、"Call
Me"等金曲创下百万销售，后者曾任重团Night Ranger、Damn
Yankees主吉它手)也间接使得Styx的声名更为远播。自84年宣告解散以来历经数次分合，主唱Dennis De
Young最后决定与乐团分道扬镳，多年的纷扰也告一段落。

  
这组于70年代初期便大放异彩的摇滚经典团Styx，虽经历着新旧世代的交替，然而他们所创立的前卫/艺术概念式音乐导向，以及同时霸占硬式/成人摇滚区块，横越流行音乐籓篱，毫不俗媚且迎合大众口味的谱写出首首经典脍炙人口的歌曲，来自美国芝加哥、并于全球创下两千五百万张的销售量，Styx重要的存在，为往后音乐演进转换，奠下新秀们学习膜拜与之效法的根基！

### Come Sail Away歌词：

I'm sailing away  
Set an open course for the Virgin Sea  
'Cause I've got to be free  
Free to face the life that's ahead of me

On board, I'm the captain  
So climb aboard  
We'll search for tomorrow on every shore  
And I'll try, oh Lord, I'll try to carry on

I look to the sea  
Reflections in the waves spark my memory  
Some happy, some sad  
I think of childhood friends and the dreams we had

We lived happily forever  
So the story goes  
But somehow we missed out on the pot of gold  
But we'll try best that we can to carry on

A gathering of Angels appeared above my head  
They sang to me this song of hope and this is what they said

They said, "Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me lads  
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me  
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me baby  
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me"

I thought that they were Angels, but to my surprise  
We climbed aboard their starship, we headed for the skies

Singing, come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me lads  
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me  
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me  
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me

Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me  
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me  
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me  
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
