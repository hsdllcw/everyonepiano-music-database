### What a Man Gotta Do歌词：

Cut my heart about one two times  
Don't need to question the reason I'm yours I'm yours  
I know the other lose a fight just to see you smile  
'Cause you got no flaws no flaws  
I'm not trying to be your part time lover  
Sign me up for that full time I'm yours all yours  
So what a man gotta do  
What a man gotta do  
To be totally locked up by you  
What a man gotta say  
What a man gotta pray  
To be your last good night and first good day  
So what a man gotta do  
What a man gotta do  
To be totally locked up by you  
What a man gotta do  
What a man gotta prove  
To be totally locked up by you  
You ain't trying to be wasting time  
On stupid people and cheap lines I'm sure I'm sure  
So I'd give a million dollars just to go grab me by the collar  
And I'll gonna be lost be lost  
I'm not trying to be your part time lover  
Sign me up for that full time I'm yours I'm yours  
What a man gotta do  
What a man gotta do  
To be totally locked up by you  
What a man gotta say  
What a man gotta pray  
To be your last good night and first good day  
So what a man gotta do  
What a man gotta do  
To be totally locked up by you  
What a man gotta do  
What a man gotta prove  
To be totally locked up by you  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Tell me what a man gotta do  
So what a man gotta do  
Man gotta do  
What a man gotta do  
What a man gotta do yeah  
To be totally locked up by you  
Totally locked up by you  
What a man gotta say  
Man gotta say  
What a man gotta pray  
What a man gotta pray  
To be your last good night and first good day  
So what a man gotta do  
What a man gotta do  
What a man gotta do  
To be totally locked up by you  
Totally locked up by you  
What a man gotta do  
Hey baby  
What a man gotta prove  
What a man gotta do  
To be totally locked up by you  
Totally locked up by you
