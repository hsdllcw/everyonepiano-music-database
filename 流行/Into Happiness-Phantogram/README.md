### Into Happiness歌词：

There I go  
There I am  
A life of gold  
How long I've been driving  
Fall into happiness  
Wish you could be here  
No more loneliness  
You’d make it perfect  
There I go  
Life might get cold  
A life of gold  
Funny how things roll  
Fall into happiness  
Wish you could be here  
No more loneliness  
You'd make it perfect  
Fall into happiness  
Wish you could be here  
No more loneliness  
You'd make it perfect  
Everything is changing  
Sorry I’ve been missing  
Down the road I've left behind  
Everything is clearer now  
I've been getting better  
How could I have been so blind?  
Into happiness  
Wish you could be here  
No more loneliness  
You'd make it perfect  
Fall into happiness  
Wish you could be here  
No more loneliness  
You'd make it perfect  
Everything is changing  
Sorry I've been missing(Wish you could be here)  
Down the road I've left behind  
Everything is clearer now  
I've been getting better(You make it perfect)  
How could I have been so blind?  
Wish you could be here  
You’d make it perfect
