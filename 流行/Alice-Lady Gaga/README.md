**Alice双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Alice_ 是美国流行天后Lady Gaga的一首歌曲，收录在Lady Gaga于2020年5月29日发行的第六张录音室专辑《Chromatica》。

作为专辑的开篇曲，GaGa用Alice的视角在梦境中，忽逢桃花源式的Chromatica，而Chromatica的五彩斑斓正如同Alice心中美好的希望与幻想。也许，Alice就是GaGa自己，一位正沉浸在自己甜美梦境的少女，一位带领大家进入Chromatica魔法城堡的引路人，一位用爱与正义的魔法唤醒人们的魔仙。

### Alice歌词：

My name isn't Alice  
But I'll keep looking I'll keep looking for wonderland  
My name isn't Alice  
But I'll keep looking I'll keep looking for wonderland wonderland  
Ah ah ah oh ah ah ah  
Set me free  
Ah ah ah oh ah ah ah  
Set me free  
Could you pull me out of this alive  
Ah ah ah oh ah ah ah  
Where's my body I'm stuck in my mind  
Ah ah ah oh ah ah ah  
Oh ma ma ma oh ma ma ma  
I'm tired of screaming  
Oh ma ma ma oh ma ma ma  
At the top of my lungs  
Oh my mother oh my mother  
I'm in the hole I'm falling down down  
So down down  
My name isn't Alice  
But I'll keep looking I'll keep looking for wonderland  
My name isn't Alice  
But I'll keep looking I'll keep looking for wonderland wonderland  
Take me home  
Take me to wonderland wonderland  
Take me home  
Take me to wonderland wonderland  
Sick and tired of waking up  
Screaming at the top of my lungs  
Think I might have just left myself behind  
Maestro play me your symphony  
I will listen to anything  
Take me on a trip DJ free my mind  
My name isn't Alice  
But I'll keep looking I'll keep looking for wonderland  
My name isn't Alice  
But I'll keep looking I'll keep looking for wonderland wonderland  
Take me home  
Take me to wonderland wonderland  
Take me home  
Take me to wonderland wonderland  
Take me home  
Take me to wonderland wonderland  
Take me home  
Take me to wonderland wonderland  
Ah ah ah oh ah ah ah oh  
Set me free  
Ah ah ah oh ah ah ah oh  
Set me free
