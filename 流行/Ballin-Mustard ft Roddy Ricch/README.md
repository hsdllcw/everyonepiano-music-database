### Ballin'歌词：

Mustard on the beat ho  
I put the new Forgis on the Jeep  
I trap until the bloody bottoms is underneath  
'Cause all my n***as got it out the streets  
I keep a hundred racks inside my jeans  
I remember hittin' the mall with the whole team  
Now a n***a can't answer calls 'cause I'm ballin'  
I was wakin' up gettin' racks in the morning  
I was broke now I'm rich these n***as salty  
All these designer on my body got me drip drip ayy  
Straight up out the Yajects I'm a big Crip  
If I got a pint of lean I'ma sip sip  
I run the racks up with my queen like London and Nip  
But I got rich on all these n***as I didn't forget back  
I had to go through the struggle I didn't forget that  
I hop inside of the Maybach and now I can sit back  
These b***hes know me now 'cause I got them big racks  
'Cause I'm gettin' money now I know you heard that  
Young n***a on the corner b***h I had to serve crack  
Uncle fronted me some P's had to get them birds back  
We came up on dirty money I gave it a birdbath  
Cut off the brain and I give my b***h a new coupe  
Either you frontin' y'all gang or you're suwoop  
Got a New Orleans b***h and man that p***y voodoo  
And I'm that n***a now who knew  
I put the new Forgis on the Jeep  
I trap until the bloody bottoms is underneath  
'Cause all my n***as got it out the streets  
I keep a hundred racks inside my jeans  
I remember hittin' the mall with the whole team  
Now a n***a can't answer calls 'cause I'm ballin'  
I was wakin' up gettin' racks in the morning  
I was broke now I'm rich these n***as salty  
I been wakin' up to get the money woah woah  
Got a bad b***h her a*s tatted woah woah  
Givenchy to my toes two twins I'm f**king 'em both  
I put in a new AP the water like a boat  
I was down bad on my d**k where was you n***as at  
I know you turned your back on me just to get some racks  
I see you swerve back 'cause I'm in the black 'Bach  
New diamonds on me f**k a flash this ain't Snapchat  
'Cause I been gettin' paid  
Yellow diamonds on me look like lemonade  
Grab my baby mama that new Bentayga  
Tryna get the dojo like a sensei yeah  
Rolls Royce umbrellas when I'm in the rain  
I just mind my business  
I got brothers that did the time I ain't kiddin'  
All these rappers just talk about it I live it  
Goin' up I ain't got no sky limit yeah yeah yeah  
I put the new Forgis on the Jeep  
I trap until the bloody bottoms is underneath  
'Cause all my n***as got it out the streets  
I keep a hundred racks inside my jeans  
I remember hittin' the mall with the whole team  
Now a n***a can't answer calls 'cause I'm ballin'  
I was wakin' up gettin' racks in the morning  
I was broke now I'm rich these n***as salty  
I ayy yeah  
I've been ballin' lil' n***a  
Now watch me ball on these n***as  
Yeah now watch me ball on these n***as yeah  
Now watch me ball on these n***as  
Now watch me ball on these n***as yeah yeah
