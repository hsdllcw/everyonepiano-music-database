**Change Your Life双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_  
Change Your Life_ 是英国少女团体Little Mix的歌曲，收录在其专辑DNA (2012)中。Little
Mix（小混合、小混混）是由Perrie Edwards, Jesy Nelson, Leigh-Anne Pinnock及Jade
Thirlwall所组成的。

  
Little Mix（小混合、小混混）她们因打破传统成为英国人气歌唱比赛The X
Factor史上第一个夺冠的团体而成名，除此之外，她们的夺冠经历更改写了女子团体在比赛中一定走不远的命运。Little Mix不仅改写了The X
Factor的历史，赛后也有傲人的成绩，她们是自2005年以来第一个不用在The X Factor上表演就能够首单空降英国单曲榜的冠军。

  
Little Mix的另一卖点是她们完美的和声，在现今众多女子组合都不再流行和声的年代，这四个女孩在The X
Factor上一次又一次的精彩演出为她们带来了大量的支持者，她们在第7周演绎的歌曲"Don't Let
Go"更是因为她们的表演而在多年后重新于英国单曲榜中出现。

### Change Your Life歌词：

She captures her reflexion then she throws the mirror to the floor  
Her image is distorted screaming is it worth it anymore  
No-oh-oh  
Are you scared of the things that they might put you through?  
Does it make you wanna hide the inner you?  
You’re not the only one so let them criticize  
You’re untouchable when you realize  
Chorus:  
Change, change your life, take it all  
We’re gonna stick together, no one gets through it all  
Change, change your life, take it all  
You’re gonna use it to become what you’ve always known  
(become what you’ve always known)  
This body starts to flicker like nobody wants to know his name  
Just another sower feeling, but nobody there to feel the pain  
No, no, no  
They can rip you, bring you down, down to the sides  
But they will never get to the heart you hold inside  
Oh-oh  
You’re not the only one so let them criticize  
You’re untouchable when you realize  
Ooo-oh-oh  
Chorus:  
Change, change your life, take it all  
(take it all)  
We’re gonna stick together, no one gets through it all  
(gets through it all)  
Change, change your life, take it all  
(take it all)  
You’re gonna use it to become what you’ve always known  
(become what you’ve always known)  
Change, change your life, take it all  
Change your life and take it all  
Change, change your life, take it all  
Change your life and take it all  
You have the right to show the world (something never seen)  
We wanna hear you scream it out (you’re not alone)  
Chorus:  
Change, change your life, take it all  
(take it all)  
We’re gonna stick together, no one gets through it all  
(gets through it all)  
Change, change your life, take it all  
(change your life and take it all)  
You’re gonna use it to become what you’ve always known  
(become what you’ve always known)
