### Supalonely歌词：

I know I f**ked up I'm just a loser  
Shouldn't be with ya guess I'm a quitter  
But you're out there drinkin' I'm just here thinkin'  
'Bout where I should've been  
I've been lonely mm ah yeah  
Water pouring down from the ceiling  
I knew this would happen still hard to believe it  
Maybe I'm dramatic I don't wanna seem it  
I don't wanna panic  
I'm a sad girl in this big world  
It's a mad world ooh ooh ooh  
All of my friends know what's happened you're a bad thing ah  
I know I f**ked up I'm just a loser  
Shouldn't be with ya guess I'm a quitter  
But you're out there drinkin' I'm just here thinkin'  
'Bout where I should've been  
I've been lonely mm ah yeah  
La-la-la-la la-la-la-la  
Lonely I'm a lonely b***h  
La-la-la-la la-la-la-la  
Lonely super lonely  
Now I'm in the bathtub cryin'  
Think I'm slowly sinking bubbles in my eyes  
Now maybe I'm just dreamin'  
Now I'm in the sad club just tryna get a backrub lonely  
I'm a sad girl in this big world  
It's a mad world  
All of my friends know what's happened you're a bad thing  
I know I f**ked up I'm just a loser  
Shouldn't be with ya guess I'm a quitter  
While you're out there drinkin' I'm just here thinkin'  
'Bout where I should've been  
I've been lonely mm ah yeah  
La-la-la-la woo la-la-la-la  
Lonely I'm a lonely b***h  
La-la-la-la la-la-la-la  
Lonely super lonely  
I loathe romancing in itself I'll be d**ned to try  
I'm only dancin' by myself so I don't slam my Irish buck  
Compostable cups B-B-BENEE I-I can't stress this enough  
I would hate to mess things  
Up but my boogie still stays restless as f**k  
I know I f**ked up I'm just a loser  
Shouldn't be with ya guess I'm a quitter  
But you're out there drinkin' I'm just here thinkin'  
'Bout where I should've been  
I've been lonely mm ah yeah  
La-la-la-la la-la-la-la la la-la-la la-la-la la-la  
Lonely I'm a lonely b***h la la-la-la la-la-la la-la  
La-la-la  
Lonely super lonely  
La-la-la-la la-la-la-la I've been lonely  
Lonely  
I've been lonely by the way  
La-la-la-la la-la-la-la la la-la-la la-la  
Lonely I've been lonely
