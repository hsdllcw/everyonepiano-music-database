### Think About Us歌词：

When you're dancin' in the club  
And the nights are getting hard  
Do you think about us  
Do you think about us  
When the music gets so loud  
And the girls are all around  
Do you think about us  
Do you think about us  
'Cause I do think about you  
When I'm up here in my hotel room  
Need your love don't know what I'm gon' do  
My body so hot babe I'm missin' you  
One touch is all I want  
I call my girls we go down to the club  
Walk through the crowd 'til I find my love  
I look in your eyes and the whole world stop woah oh  
You put your hand on my waist  
And then you pull me close  
Boy I promise I won't let go  
Now we're dancing in the club  
And it's fire when we touch  
Do you think about us  
Do you think about us  
When we're deeper in the crowd  
Can you feel my body now  
Do you think about us  
Oh-woah-oh  
Do you think about us  
Oh-woah-oh  
Do you think about us  
'Cause I do think about you  
Can't shake you off baby stuck like glue  
Now we're alone got my body on you  
You don't even know all the things I wan' do  
One touch need your love  
Me and my baby we up in the club  
Ain't nobody else you know it's all about us  
Ain't nobody else you know it's all about us woah  
You put your hand on my waist  
And then you pull me close  
Boy I promise I won't let go  
Now dancin' we're in the club  
And it's fire when we touch  
Do you think about us  
Do you think about us  
When we're deeper in the crowd  
Can you feel my body now  
Do you think about us  
Oh-woah-oh  
Do you think about us  
Oh-woah-oh  
Do you think about us  
Oh-woah-oh  
Do you think about us  
I I been thinkin' 'bout us yeah  
All the cities we made up in  
Situations that we been through through  
Have you been thinkin' 'bout me too  
I've had some things on my mind  
I want to tell you  
Can we spend some time  
I cut the schedule for you  
Can I put you on a jet tonight tonight  
Can I VV's your neck with diamonds  
Let me put some drip on you  
Vivienne Westwood  
Let me put Chanel on you  
That new Balenciaga  
YSL on you  
Girl you goddess do you think about us  
Do you think about us  
Oh-woah-oh  
Do you think about us

Oh-na-na-na-na do you think about us  
Oh-na-na-na-na do you think about us  
Oh-na-na-na-na do you think about us  
I wanna know
