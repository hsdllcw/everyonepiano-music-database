### Work歌词：

[Chorus - Rihanna:]  
Work, work, work, work, work, work  
He say me have to  
Work, work, work, work, work, work!  
He see me do me  
Dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt!  
So me put in  
Work, work, work, work, work, work  
When you all gon'?  
Learn, learn, learn, learn, learn  
Me no care if him  
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurting

[Verse 1 - Rihanna:]  
Dry!... Me a desert him  
No time to have you lurking  
Him ah go act like he don't like it  
You know I dealt with you the nicest  
Nobody touch me, you the righteous  
Nobody text me in a crisis  
I believed all of your dreams, adoration  
You took my heart and my keys and my patience  
You took my heart on my sleeve for decoration  
You mistaken my love I brought for you for foundation  
All that I wanted from you was to give me  
Something that I never had  
Something that you've never seen  
Something that you've never been!  
Mmmmm!  
But I wake up and act like nothing's wrong  
Just get ready fi...

[Chorus - Rihanna:]  
Work, work, work, work, work, work  
He say me have to  
Work, work, work, work, work, work!  
He see me do me  
Dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt!  
So me put in  
Work, work, work, work, work, work  
Ner ner ner ner ner ner!  
When you all gon' learn, learn, learn, learn, learn!  
Before the tables turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn!

[Verse 2 - Rihanna:]  
Beg you something please  
Baby don't you leave  
Don't leave me stuck here in the streets, uh huh  
If I get another chance to  
I will never, no never neglect you  
I mean who am I to hold your past against you?  
I just hope that it gets to you  
I hope that you see this through  
I hope that you see this true  
What can I say?  
Please recognize I'm tryin', babe!  
I have to

[Chorus - Rihanna:]  
Work, work, work, work, work, work  
He say me have to  
Work, work, work, work, work, work!  
He see me do me  
Dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt!  
So me put in  
Work, work, work, work, work, work  
When you all gon'  
Learn, learn, learn, learn, learn  
Me no care if him  
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurting

[Verse 3 - Drake:]  
Yeah, okay  
You need to get done, done, done, done at work, come over  
We just need to slow the motion  
Don't give that away to no one  
Long distance, I need you  
When I see potential I just gotta see it through  
If you had a twin, I would still choose you  
I don't wanna rush into it, if it's too soon  
But I know you need to get done, done, done, done  
If you come over  
Sorry if I'm way less friendly  
I got niggas tryna end me, oh  
I spilled all my emotions tonight, I'm sorry  
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'  
How many more shots until you're rollin'?  
We just need a face to face  
You could pick the time and the place  
You spent some time away  
Now you need to forward and give me all the...

[Chorus - Rihanna & Drake:]  
Work, work, work, work, work, work  
He say me have to  
Work, work, work, work, work, work  
He see me do me  
Dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt!  
So me put in  
Work, work, work, work, work, work  
When you all gon'  
Learn, learn, learn, learn, learn  
Me no care if him  
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurting

[Outro - Rihanna:]  
Mmmmm, mmmmm  
Mmmmm, mmmmm  
Work, work, work, work, work, work  
Mmmmm, mmmmm
