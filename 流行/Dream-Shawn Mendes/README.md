**Dream** 出自加拿大创作歌手Shawn Mendes的第四张录音室专辑Wonder。

_Dream_
绝对是整专最温柔的一首歌，歌曲开头像是蔚蓝深海处的吟唱，与封面相呼应。不难发现，Mendes的声线变得更加成熟，却不失少年气。偏向迷幻摇滚的编曲在一丝丝甜酥的气息中编织了一个个美梦，幻梦交替，令人在缤纷中沉迷，跌入充满奇妙而充满爱意的迪士尼梦境一般。“Hello
hello hello”三个字有在向听众递出一封浓烈甜蜜的情书，信书的内容都是“ Dream about you
”。结尾如同醉梦初醒，在电子乐器营造下的美梦破碎，虽遗憾，但值得。

### Dream歌词：

Dream dream dream dream  
Hello hello hello can I hear an echo  
Purple red and yellow I can't wait to get home  
Head down on the pillow  
Holding you is all I think about  
You're asleep in London I wish you were coming  
Back home to me darling you're too far away  
Count back from one hundred  
Holding you is all I think about  
Oh baby when I'm apart from you  
I just shut my eyes all I have to do  
Is dream dream dream dream  
About you  
Dream dream dream dream  
About you  
About you about you about you about you  
About you about you about you about you  
Hello hello hello walking through a meadow  
Full of sunflowers picking off the petals  
I don't wanna wake up without you laying next to me yeah  
I'm no good at waiting all the separation  
Feeling suffocated I just need to breathe  
And I'm starting to hate it  
I can't wait to fall asleep  
Oh baby when I'm apart from you  
I just close my eyes  
And all I have to do  
Is dream dream dream dream  
About you  
About you about you about you about you  
About you about you about you about you  
Dream dream dream dream  
About you  
About you about you about you about you  
About you about you about you about you  
Dream dream dream dream  
About you  
About you about you about you about you  
About you about you about you about you  
Dream dream dream dream  
About you  
Dream dream dream dream  
About you
