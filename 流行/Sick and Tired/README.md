### Sick and Tired歌词：

iann dior/Machine Gun Kelly：  
I've been losin' my mind tryna figure it out  
But I'm stuck in the drought I guess I'll start again  
I've been losin' my mind tryna figure it out  
But I'm stuck in this house I am my only friend  
iann dior：  
Lately I know I've been a punk and I need to sober up  
Double cup it got me stuck I think I'm losin' it  
Yeah  
'Cause every time that I've been gettin' stuck  
I'm stuck  
There's a line inside my head  
My head  
Of all my friends that they've been dead since I made it out  
It's every time that you cross my mind  
Remember the times but I know that you won't ever change  
I'm not sobering up sick and tired of love  
If you draw that line bae I hope you know I'm crossin' it  
iann dior/Machine Gun Kelly：  
I've been losin' my mind tryna figure it out  
But I'm stuck in the drought I guess I'll start again  
I've been losin' my mind tryna figure it out  
But I'm stuck in this house I am my only friend  
Over and over again it's like I never win  
Why you puttin' me down  
It don't make any sense  
I'm not sober again but I'm tryna pretend  
Like everything's alright but it's hard to wait  
Machine Gun Kelly：  
I get drunk and interruptive  
My eyes look red because I'm mad at myself  
I stab the openin'  
Lately everything I say  
You just tell me it's wrong  
I told her I won't be here long  
I can't hold it in  
Every time you cross my mind  
I brought another memory to keep yours inside  
I saw us drown like hightide  
And everything is nothing if you're not here tonight  
iann dior/Machine Gun Kelly：  
I've been losin' my mind tryna figure it out  
But I'm stuck in the drought I guess I'll start again  
I've been losin' my mind tryna figure it out  
But I'm stuck in this house I am my only friend  
Over and over again it's like I never win  
Why you puttin' me down  
It don't make any sense  
I'm not sober again but I'm tryna pretend  
Like everything's alright but it's hard to wait  
Oh oh oh-oh woah  
Yeah  
Oh oh oh-oh woah  
Oh woah  
Oh oh oh-oh woah  
Oh oh oh-oh woah
