**Immortals** 是来自芝加哥的一个乐队Fall Out Boy与Mikky
Ekko一同合作的单曲的歌曲。该乐队组建于2001年，曾获格莱美提名。充满年轻活力朝气，畅快将庞克的不羁气焰完全释放，些许EMO风格夹带流畅声线， Fall
Out Boy虽然和时下偶像团体般，在团名中加入个"Boy"字眼，但是，他们可完全不按牌理出牌，踢爆时下做作男孩偶像团体的面具，给你最热血的新世代之音！

### Immortals歌词：

They say we are what we are,  
But we don't have to be,  
I'm bad behavior but I do it in the best way,  
I'll be the watcher (watcher) of the eternal flame,  
I'll be the guard dog of all your fever dreams,

Oooooooh  
I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass (glass, glass)  
Oooooooh,  
I try to picture me without you but I can't

'Cause we could be immortals, immortals  
Just not for long, for long,  
And live with me forever now,  
Pull the blackout curtains down,  
Just not for long, for long,  
Because we could be immooooooo- immortals,  
Immooooooo- immortals,  
Immooooooo- immortals,  
Immooooooo- immortals,

Sometimes the only pay off for having any faith,  
Is when it's tested again and again everyday,  
I'm still comparing your past to my future,  
It might be your wound but they're my sutures,

Oooooooh  
I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass (glass, glass)  
Oooooooh,  
I try to picture me without you but I can't

'Cause we could be immortals, immortals,  
Just not for long, for long,  
And live with me forever now,  
Pull the blackout curtains down,  
Just not for long, for long,  
We could be immooooooo- immortals,  
Immooooooo- immortals,

Immortals,  
And live with me forever now,  
Pull the blackout curtains down,

we could be immortals, immortals,  
Just not for long, for long,  
We could be immooooooo- immortals,  
Immooooooo- immortals,  
Immooooooo- immortals,  
Immooooooo- immortals
