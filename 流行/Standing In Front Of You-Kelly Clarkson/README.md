### Standing In Front Of You歌词：

You say it's easier  
Alone and undisturbed  
You said yes and danced before  
And got your feelings hurt  
You say most days yours good  
It's not so bad this room  
What chance the rain today  
Even though it's clear and sunny  
And you fight it so hard  
How to tell if it's real or not

Take a breath and listen (listen)  
Open up stop pushin' (pushin')  
All that you've been missin' (missin')  
Standing in front of you  
Everything you're fearin' (fearin')  
All the walls you're buildin' (buildin')  
Take a chance you're reason (reason)  
Standing in front of you  
(Standing in front of you)  
Standing in front of you  
(Standing in front of you)

You start to sway again  
Feelin' good in your skin  
You start to remember when  
You didn't have to try  
And then the glitter turns to dust  
The color fades enough to make out pictures of a fire  
That burns like love  
You can close your eyes don't worry  
I'll still be here in the morning

Take a breath and listen (listen)  
Open up stop pushin' (pushin')  
All that you've been missin' (missin')  
Standing in front of you  
Everything you're fearin' (fearin')  
All the walls you're buildin' (buildin')  
Take a chance you're reason (reason)  
Standing in front of you  
(Standing in front of you)  
Standing in front of you  
(Standing in front of you)

And they won't break us  
And they can't get through  
Cause I'm gunna be here  
Standing in front of you

Take a breath and listen (listen)  
Open up stop pushin' (pushin')  
All that you've been missin' (missin')  
Standing in front of you  
Everything you're fearin' (fearin')  
All the walls you're buildin' (buildin')  
Take a chance you're reason (reason)  
Standing in front of you  
(Standing in front of you)  
Standing in front of you  
(Standing in front of you)  
Standing in front of you  
(Standing in front of you)
