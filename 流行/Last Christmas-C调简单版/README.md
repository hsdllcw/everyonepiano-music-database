### Last Christmas歌词：

Last Christmas I gave you my heart  
But the very next day you gave it away  
This year to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special  
Once bitten and twice shy  
I keep my distance  
But you still catch my eyes  
Tell me baby' do you recognize me  
Well it's been a year  
It doesn't surprise me  
Merry Christmas  
I wrapped it up and sent it  
With a note saying I love you I meant it  
Now I know what a fool I've been  
But if u kiss me now  
I know you'd fool me again  
Last Christmas I gave you my heart  
But the very next day you gave it away  
This year to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special  
Last Christmas I gave you my heart  
But the very next day you gave it away  
This year to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special  
A crowded room  
Friends with tired eyes  
I'm hidding from you and your soul of ice  
My god i thought you were Someone to rely on Me  
I guess I was a shoulder to cry on  
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart  
A gril under cover but you tore her apart  
Maybe this year Maybe this year  
I'll give it to someone special  
'Cause Last Christmas I gave you my heart  
But the very next day you gave it away  
This year to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special  
Last Christmas I gave you my heart  
But the very next day you gave it away  
This year to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special  
And last Christmas  
And this year  
Won't be anything like anything like  
Last Christmas I gave you my heart  
But the very next day you gave it away  
This year to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special
