**Impossible Year双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Impossible Year_ 出自美国乐队Panic! At the Disco第五张录音室专辑《Death of a
Bachelor》，专辑计划于2016年1月15日发行。Panic! At The
Disco这名字看来有点古怪。根据他们的解释，"Panic"一字是引自加洲奥兰治县(The O.C.!!)乐队Name Taken中的一句歌词，以及The
Smiths的同名歌曲而作成的。虽然他们没有对At The Disco作任何注解，但是凭着这个字根，你也可以想象他们的音乐类型了。

歌词下方是 _Impossible Year钢琴谱_ ，希望大家喜欢。

### Impossible Year歌词：

There's no sunshine  
This impossible year  
Only black days and sky grey  
And clouds full of fear  
And storms full of sorrow  
That won't disappear  
Just typhoons and monsoons  
This impossible year

There's no good times  
This impossible year  
Just a beachfront of bad blood  
And a coast that's unclear  
All the guests at the party  
They're so insincere  
They just intrude and exclude  
This impossible year

There's no you and me  
This impossible year  
Only heartache and heartbreak  
And gin made of tears  
The bitter pill is swallowed  
The scars souvenir  
That tattoo, your last bruise  
This impossible year

There's never air to breathe  
There's never in-betweens  
These nightmares always hang on past the dream

There's no sunshine  
There's no you and me  
There's no good times  
This impossible year
