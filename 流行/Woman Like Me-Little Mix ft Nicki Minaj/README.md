### Woman Like Me歌词：

I always say what I'm feeling  
I I was born without a zip on my mouth  
Sometimes I don't even mean it  
It takes a little while to figure me out  
I like my coffee with two sugars in it  
High heels and my jewellery drippin'  
Drinkin' I get all fired up  
Hey hey hey  
Insecure but I'm working with it  
Many things that I could get rid of  
Ain't about to give it up  
I made a few mistakes that I regret it nightly  
I broke a couple hearts that I wear on my sleeve  
My mama always said "Girl your troubling"  
And now I wonder could you fall for a woman like me  
And every time we touch oh you make me feel weak  
I can tell you're shy and I think you're so sweet  
Spending every night under covers and  
Still I wonder could you fall for a woman like me  
A woman  
Woman like me like a woman like me  
La la la woman like me like a woman like me  
La la la woman like like a woman like me  
La la la woman like me like a woman like me  
Baby just be mine for the weekend  
We can get a takeaway and sit on the couch  
We could just go out for the e evening  
Hopefully end up with you kissing my mouth eh eh eh  
You got them blue jeans with the rip up in em  
My hair with your fingers in it  
Love it when you turn me on  
'Yoncé in a little of it  
Love drunk in the middle with it  
Get down to our favourite song  
I made a few mistakes that I regret it nightly  
I broke a couple hearts that I wear on my sleeve  
My mama always said "Girl your troubling"  
And now I wonder could you fall for a woman like me  
And every time we touch oh you make me feel weak  
I can tell you're shy and I think your so sweet  
Spending every night under covers and  
Still I wonder could you fall for a woman like me  
A woman  
Woman like me like a woman like me  
La la la woman like me like a woman like me  
La la la woman like like a woman like me  
La la la woman like me like a woman like me  
Yo  
Woman like me it's a woman like me  
Soon as I brush up on him I can tell he like me  
You know all them mandem my trife they swiped me  
Not that they've be could afford the ice me  
Tell em there's a bad Trini b***h in your area  
But the more bad b***hes then the more merrier  
Baddies to my left and to the right a little scarier  
Rude boy tell me can you handle all this derriere rrh  
Uh a million I'm gettin' my billion  
Greatest of all time 'cause I'm a chameleon  
I switch it up for every era I'm really bomb  
These b***hes really wanna be Nicki I'm really mom  
Apple cut the check I want all this money  
7 up go grip the tech and leave all this bloody  
It's the queen and Little Mix stated on Missouri  
My daddy is indian swish all this curry  
Woman like me like a woman like me  
La la la woman like me like a woman like me  
I made a few mistakes that I regret it nightly  
I broke a couple hearts that I wear on my sleeve  
Mama always said "Girl your troubling"  
And now I wonder could you fall for a woman like me  
Every time we touch oh you make me feel weak  
I can tell you're shy and I think your so sweet  
Spending every night under covers and  
Still I wonder could you fall for a woman like me  
Woman like me like a woman like me  
La la la woman like me like a woman like me  
La la la woman like like a woman like me  
La la la woman like me like a woman like me  
A woman  
Young money grrrr
