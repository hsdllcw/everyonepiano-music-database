### Without Me歌词：

Found you when your heart was broke  
I filled your cup until it overflowed  
Took it so far to keep you close keep you close  
I was afraid to leave you on your own  
I said I'd catch you if you fall fall  
And if they laugh then f**k 'em all all  
And then I got you off your knees  
Put you right back on your feet  
Just so you could take advantage of me  
Tell me how's it feel sittin' up there  
Feeling so high but too far away to hold me  
You know I'm the one who put you up there  
Name in the sky  
Does it ever get lonely  
Thinking you could live without me  
Thinking you could live without me  
Baby I'm the one who put you up there  
I don't know why yeah I don't know why  
Thinking you could live without me  
Live without me  
Baby I'm the one who put you up there  
I don't know why I don't know why yeah yeah  
Gave love 'bout a hundred tries hundred tries  
Just running from the demons in your mind  
Then I took yours and made 'em mine made 'em mine  
I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind  
Said I'd catch you if you fall fall  
And if they laugh then f**k 'em all all  
And then I got you off your knees  
Put you right back on your feet  
Just so you could take advantage of me  
Tell me how's it feel sittin' up there  
Feeling so high but too far away to hold me  
You know I'm the one who put you up there  
Name in the sky  
Does it ever get lonely  
Thinking you could live without me  
Thinking you could live without me  
Baby I'm the one who put you up there  
I don't know why yeah I don't know why  
Thinking you could live without me  
Live without me  
Baby I'm the one who put you up there  
I don't know why yeah  
You don't have to say just what you did  
I already know I know  
I had to go and find out from them  
So tell me how's it feel oh-woah  
Tell me how's it feel sittin' up there  
Feeling so high but too far away to hold me  
You know I'm the one who put you up there  
Name in the sky  
Does it ever get lonely  
Thinking you could live without me  
Thinking you could live without me  
Baby I'm the one who put you up there  
I don't know why yeah I don't know why
