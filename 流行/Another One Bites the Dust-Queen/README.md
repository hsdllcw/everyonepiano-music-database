**Another One Bites the Dust** 是Queen（皇后乐队）于80年代的专辑《The Game》中的一首单曲。

  
这首 _Another One Bites the Dust_ 曲与《Crazy Little Thing Called Love》的再次成功使《The
Game》专辑登上了美国排行榜的冠军宝座，这对于QUEEN来说是一次突破性的成功。

  
不过，当人们发现这不过是一张乖巧讨好的专辑时，他们开始失去了对QUEEN的兴趣，乐队原本忠实的拥护者不少都改弦易帜，尤其是在美国，其直接后果就是他们在同年晚些时候为电影《Flash
Gordon》录制的纯器乐配乐专辑得到的反应异常的冷淡。

### Another One Bites the Dust歌词：

Oh! Let's go!  
Steve walks warily down the street  
With the brim pulled way down low.  
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet,  
Machine guns ready to go.  
Are you ready, hey, are you ready for this?  
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?  
Out of the doorway the bullets rip  
To the sound of the beat  
Another one bites the dust  
Another one bites the dust  
And another one gone, and another one gone  
Another one bites the dust  
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too  
Another one bites the dust  
How do you think I'm going to get along  
Without you when you're gone?  
You took me for everything that I had  
And kicked me out on my own  
Are you happy, are you satisfied?  
How long can you stand the heat?  
Out of the doorway the bullets rip  
To the sound of the beat  
[Chorus]  
Another one bites the dust  
Another one bites the dust  
Another one bites the dust  
Another one bites the dust  
There are plenty of ways that you can hurt a man  
And bring him to the ground  
You can beat him, you can cheat him  
You can treat him bad and leave him when he's down  
But I'm ready, yes, I'm ready for you  
I'm standing on my own two feet  
Out of the doorway the bullets rip  
Repeating to the sound of the beat  
[Chorus]
