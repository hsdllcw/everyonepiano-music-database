### Emotionally Scarred歌词：

A love letter came through the mail it said "I miss you"  
I ripped it up and flushed with the tissue try to forget you  
I ain't got nothing against you we human we all got issues  
But I'm tired of being tired of being tired  
That part of me done died  
I see it then I don't act like I'm blind  
I'm confident it won't be one of mine  
I know emotions come with lies so I tell the truth all the time  
Ain't got no sympathy for no b***h  
I admit that I'm rich and I'm lit  
Jumpin' up on stages I get two hundred occasion  
Bro had really f**ked the game up we made n***as shut they trap down  
They see how I made it I'm the reason they won't rap now  
See me out in traffic make a hater pull his hat down  
The biggest OG's salute me a stylist can't even style me  
The robbers probably wanna get me I'm hoppin' out Lamborghinis  
The youngins turn in my city they try me I get it cracking  
Some of this still would happen if I never had started rapping  
My people them still steady trapping and they still be getting active  
I tell 'em to chill I'm tryna run up these M's  
Paid cash and then he post the crib  
Nah  
I can't show nobody where my mama live that's how I 'posed to feel  
My niece just asked me were my diamonds real I said "Of course"  
I just played the hand that I was dealt didn't have to force  
All around the world they know it's me they hear my voice  
And I done it all in a pair of Diors yeah  
Young age learned how to get paid  
We gon' get the money  
Big stage long way from Section 8  
Ballin' other countries  
Big wave he gon' have to get saved  
Big old wave  
Ridin' in the foreign chiefin' on the forest  
I know I wasn't there for you at least I said I'm sorry  
You know what it was I told you that I was heartless  
I'm emotionally scarred that ain't even your fault  
But don't listen to them haters tryna fill your ears with salt  
All this revenue coming in I'll probably never spend  
I just bought my BM a Benz now that's another Benz  
I just cut off all of my friends and brought my brothers in  
I don't see nobody but me who I'm gon' lose to  
I can't move around without tools these n***as loose screws  
I can see me taking the lead over the new school  
They remember me from selling w**d at my old school  
Only hit it once and now it's old news  
Blew up who the f**k would knew  
Paint my Trackhawk Nipsey Blue  
If I get one you get one too I really move how bosses move  
I never call myself a G.O.A.T.  
I leave that love to the people  
Everybody can't go to the top I had to leave some people  
I'ma be forever scheming woke up I thought I was dreaming  
Watched my lil' boy play with toys I just dropped a tear of joy  
Some s**t that I feel for  
I been going crazy with that scoring call me baby Harden  
They say I'll be great I guess I'm waiting for it  
Young age learned how to get paid  
We gon' get the money  
Big stage long way from Section 8  
Ballin' other countries  
Big wave he gon' have to get saved  
Big old wave  
Ridin' in the foreign chiefin' on the forest  
I know I wasn't there for you at least I said I'm sorry  
You know what it was I told you that I was heartless  
I'm emotionally scarred that ain't even your fault  
But don't listen to them haters tryna fill your ears with salt  
Young age learned how to get paid  
We gon' get the money  
Big stage long way from Section 8  
Ballin' other countries  
Big wave he gon' have to get saved  
Big old wave  
Ridin' in the foreign chiefin' on the forest  
I know I wasn't there for you at least I said I'm sorry  
You know what it was I told you that I was heartless  
I'm emotionally scarred that ain't even your fault  
But don't listen to them haters tryna fill your ears with salt
