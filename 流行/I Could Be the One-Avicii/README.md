I Could Be The One歌词：

  
Do you think about me when you're all alone?  
The things we used to do, we used to be  
I could be the one to make you feel that way  
I could be the one to set you free  
Do you think about me when the crowd is gone?  
It to used be so easy, you and me  
I could be the one to make you feel that way  
I could be the one to set you free  
  
I be could the one to make you feel that way  
I could be the one to set you free  
I could be the one to make you feel that way  
I could be the one to set you free  
  
When you need a way to beat the pressure down  
When you need to find a way to breathe  
I could be the one to make you feel that way  
I could be the one to set you free  
If you never see me when the crowd is gone  
It used to be so easy, can't you see?  
I could be the one to make you feel that way  
I could be the one to set you free  
I could be the one to make you feel that way  
I could be the one to set you free  
I could be the one to make you feel that way  
I could be the one to set you free  
  
I could be the one to make you feel that way  
I could be the one to set you free  
I could be the one to make you feel that way  
I could be the one to set you free
