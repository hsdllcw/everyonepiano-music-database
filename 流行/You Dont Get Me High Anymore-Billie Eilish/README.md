**You Don't Get Me High Anymore双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_You Don't Get Me High Anymore_ 是美国女歌手、词曲作者Billie
Eilish的一首翻唱歌曲。此曲原是美国电子摇滚二人组合Phantogram演唱。Billie
Eilish的音色包含了两大要点：一是声场上的超近距离感，二是情绪上的冷酷感。本来她的音色就有一点软糯沙哑，再加上气声的包裹和录音时尽量靠近话筒所产生的“近讲效应”，就令成品里那种酥酥麻麻的颗粒感就像是在给人们的耳膜挠痒痒，让人很是沉醉。

### You Don't Get Me High Anymore歌词：

I don't like staying at home  
When the moon is bleeding red  
Woke up stoned in the backseat from a dream  
Where my teeth fell out of my head  
Cut it up cut it up yeah  
Everybody's on something here  
My god send chemical best friend  
Skeleton whispering in my ear  
Walk with me to the end  
Stare with me into the abyss  
Do you feel like letting go  
I wonder how far down it is  
Nothing is fun  
Not like before  
You don't get me high anymore  
Used to take one  
Now it's takes four  
You don't get me high anymore  
Running through emergency rooms  
Spinning wheels and ceiling fans  
My handshake cellophane landscape  
Mannequin faking it the best that I can  
Cadillac cadillac red  
No hands on the steering wheel  
I'm crashing this save a ho puppet show  
Ufo obliterate the way I feel  
Walk with me to the end  
Stare with me into the abyss  
Do you feel like letting go  
I wonder how far down it is  
Nothing is fun  
Not like before  
You don't get me high anymore  
Used to take one  
Now it's takes four  
You don't get me high anymore  
You don't get me high anymore  
You don't get me high anymore  
Walk with me to the end  
Stare with me into the abyss  
Do you feel like letting go  
I wonder how far down it is  
Nothing is fun  
Not like before  
You don't get me high anymore  
Used to take one  
Now it's takes four  
You don't get me high anymore  
High anymore  
You don't get me you don't get me high anymore  
High anymore  
You don't get me  
You don't get me high anymore
