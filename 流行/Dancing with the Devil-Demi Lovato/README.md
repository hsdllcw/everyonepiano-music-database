### Dancing with the Devil歌词：

It's just a little red wine I'll be fine  
Not like I wanna do this every night  
I've been good don't I deserve it  
I think I earned it feels like it's worth it  
In my mind mind  
Twisted reality hopeless insanity  
I told you I was okay but I was lying  
I was dancing with the devil  
Out of control  
Almost made it to heaven  
It was closer than you know  
Playing with the enemy  
Gambling with my soul  
It's so hard to say no  
When you're dancing with the devil  
It's just a little white line I'll be fine  
But soon that little white line is a little glass pipe  
Tin foil remedy almost got the best of me  
I keep praying I don't reach the end of my lifetime mm  
Twisted reality hopeless insanity  
I told you I was okay but I was lying  
I was dancing with the devil  
Out of control  
Almost made it to heaven  
It was closer than you know  
Playing with the enemy  
Gambling with my soul  
It's so hard to say no  
When you're dancing with the devil  
Thought that I knew my limit yeah  
I thought that I could quit it yeah  
I thought that I could walk away easily  
But here I am falling down on my knees  
Praying for better days to come and wash this pain away  
Could you please forgive me  
Lord I'm sorry for dancing with the devil  
Oh ye-yeah  
Dancing with the devil  
Out of control  
Almost made it to heaven  
It was closer than you know  
Closer than you know  
Playing with the enemy  
Oh  
Gambling with my soul  
It's so hard to say no  
When you're dancing with the devil  
Hm yeah
