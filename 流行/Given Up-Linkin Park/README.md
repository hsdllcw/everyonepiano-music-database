**Given Up** 是美国加利福尼亚州的摇滚乐队Linkin
Park演唱的一首歌曲。乐队由主唱查斯特•贝宁顿，麦克•信田、贝斯手菲尼克斯•法雷尔、吉他手布莱德•德尔森、鼓手罗伯•巴登和DJ采样手约瑟夫•韩组成。

另外， _Given Up_ 此曲收录在其专辑Minutes To
Midnight中。专辑主题跟以往联合公园所触及的创作主题比起来显得特别深沉、格外引人省思，但却也自我唤醒我们每一个人的危机意识。专辑标题<Minutes
to Midnight>想要表达出的其实就是『世界末日钟(Doomsday Clock)』的概念！

### Given Up歌词：

Wake in a sweat again  
Another day's been laid to waste  
In my disgrace

Stuck in my head again  
Feels like I'll never leave this place  
There's no escape

I'm my own worst enemy

[chorus]  
I've given up  
I'm sick of feeling  
Is there nothing you can say

Take this all away  
I'm suffocating  
Tell me what the fuck is wrong  
With me  
[end chorus]

I don't know what to take  
Thought I was focused but I'm scared  
I'm not prepared

I hyperventilate  
Looking for help somehow somewhere  
And no one cares

I'm my own worst enemy

[chorus]  
I've given up  
I'm sick of feeling  
Is there nothing you can say

Take this all away  
I'm suffocating  
Tell me what the fuck is wrong  
With me  
[end chorus]

[bridge]  
Goddddddd!!!!

Put me out of my misery  
Put me out of my misery  
Put me out of my  
Put me out of my fucking misery  
[end bridge]

[chorus]  
I've given up  
I'm sick of feeling  
Is there nothing you can say

Take this all away  
I'm suffocating  
Tell me what the fuck is wrong  
With me  
[end chorus]
