**I'll Be** 是美国创作型歌手Edwin McCain所演唱的歌曲。Edwin
McCain也是美国南卡罗来纳州传统滚乐不容忽视的角色，从接触乡村、灵魂乐开始，一直到青少年阶段才因为喜欢Kiss、The
Replacement的摇滚乐而真正拿起吉它玩音乐，而这条路对他来说，充满着许多意外，临时起意组了个团却因缘际会的靠着自制的作品《Solitude》而换来一张合约，自此走上音乐不归路。

### I'll Be歌词：

The strands in your eyes  
that color them wonderful  
Stop me and steal my breath  
Emeralds from mountains  
thrust towards the sky  
Never revealing their depth  
Tell me that we belong together  
Dress it up with the trappings of love  
I'll be captivated  
I'll hang from your lips  
Instead of the gallows of heartache  
that hang from above  
I'll be your cryin' shoulder  
I'll be with the trappings of love  
I'll be better when I'm older  
I'll be the greatest fan of your life  
Rain falls angry on the tin roof  
As we lie awake in my bed  
You're my survival  
you're my living proof  
My love is alive and not dead  
Tell me that we belong together  
Dress it up with the trappings of love  
I'll be captivated,  
I'll hang from your lips  
Instead of the gallows of heartache  
that hang from above  
I'll be your cryin' shoulder  
I'll be love with the trappings of love  
I'll be better when I'm older  
I'll be the greatest fan of your life  
I've dropped out, burned up,  
fought my way back from the dead  
Tuned in, turned on  
remembered the things you said  
I'll be your cryin' shoulder  
I'll be love with the trappings of love  
I'll be better when I'm older  
I'll be the greatest fan of your life  
I'll be your cryin' shoulder  
I'll be love with the trappings of love  
I'll be better when I'm older  
I'll be the greatest fan of your life  
the greatest fan of your life  
the greatest fan of your life
