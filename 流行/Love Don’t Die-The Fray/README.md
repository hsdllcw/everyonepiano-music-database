### Love Don’t Die歌词：

If I know one thing, that's true  
It ain't what you say, it's what you do  
And you don't say much, yeah, that's true  
But I listen when you do

A thousand years go by  
But love don't die

If I know one thing, that's true  
It's that I'm never leaving you  
And you don't say much, yeah, that's true  
But I lose it when you do

Don't let them tell no lie  
Love don't die

No matter where we go  
Or even if we don't  
And even if they try  
They'll never take my body from your side  
Love don't die

If there is one thing, that's true  
It's not what I say, it's what I do  
And I say too much, yeah, that's true  
So just listen to what I do

A thousand years go by  
But love don't die

No matter where we go  
Or even if we don't  
And even if they try  
They'll never take my body from your side  
Love don't die

She can break it up  
She can burn it down  
You can box it in  
Bury it in the ground  
You can close it off  
And turn it away  
Try to keep it down,  
Six feet in the ground

But love don't die

No matter where we go  
Or even if we don't  
And even if they try  
They'll never take my body from your side  
Love don't die

No matter where we go  
Or even if we don't  
I’d like to watch them try  
They'll never take my body from your side  
Love don't die
