### Nisha Labyrinth歌词：

I try blinking the tears away  
As they're trickling down my face  
I don't know how many days have passed me by  
So I'm counting 'em one by one  
But they tangle up in each other I give up so lonely  
Would you know if I vanished no  
Stuck inside this maze without an exit  
I'm so bored in this sea of emptiness  
And every night it's haunting me  
Why can't I have somebody by my side  
Someone there to keep their hand so warm in mine  
Someone to make me smile  
I can't help talking to myself alone  
Cause I think that I'll go crazy if I don't  
I wanna know my heart  
Don't remember how I got here again in the forest black as my memory  
Oh so bleak oh so desolate  
Always feel like I'm lost  
When I got nothing to lose anyway  
In the distance I see a ray of light  
Wanna reach it but I'll be staying  
Right here and now I wish I knew how  
Cause there's gotta be a reason that I came into existence right  
Someday when I see you again  
Would you take me right into your arms  
Hold me tight let your trace wash over me  
I'll follow where that light may lead  
Why can't I have somebody by my side  
Someone there to keep their hand so warm in mine  
Someone to make me smile  
I can't help talking to myself alone  
Cause I think that I'll go crazy if I don't  
I wanna know my heart  
How could you leave me here and run away  
Sick and tired of the hide and seek we play  
I'm done with all these games  
I don't know how to be the one you need  
Even if I nag just please stay here with me  
I want you now your heart  
I know there'll be somebody by my side  
Someone there to keep their hand so warm in mine  
Someone to make me smile  
I can't help talking to myself alone  
Cause my faded soul is so emotional  
I'll be alright my heart
