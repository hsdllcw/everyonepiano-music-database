**Save Your Tears双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Save Your Tears_ 是The Weeknd演唱的歌曲，收录于音乐专辑《After
Hours》。在该专辑中，听者能感受到满满的美感和疯狂，但是却超乎寻常的流畅。The
Weeknd一路进化却也一路自我创造革新，该专辑证明了他的进化还未结束且仅是开始，同时也是The
Weeknd进行的一次创新与商业性融合的全新测试。比起充满明亮气息的前一张专辑，《After
Hours》迷幻的视觉设计、细腻的假音、烟雾弥漫般的合成器氛围，以及喃喃低语的自白式唱法，更贴近威肯早期的音乐风格，让人感受着1980年代实验性音乐的狂热感觉。但细细品来，在该专辑里面却还是有The
Weeknd的基因蕴含其中。

### Save Your Tears歌词：

Ooh  
Na na yeah  
I saw you dancing in a crowded room  
You look so happy when I'm not with you  
But then you saw me caught you by surprise  
A single teardrop falling from your eyes  
I don't know why I run away  
I'll make you cry when I run away  
You could've asked me why I broke your heart  
You could've told me that you fell apart  
But you walked past me like I wasn't there  
And just pretended like you didn't care  
I don't know why I run away  
I'll make you cry when I run away  
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay  
Save your tears for another  
Save your tears for another day  
Save your tears for another day  
So I made you think that I would always stay  
I said some things that I should never say  
Yeah I broke your heart like someone did to mine  
And now you won't love me for a second time  
I don't know why I run away oh girl  
Said I'll make you cry when I run away  
Girl take me back 'cause I wanna stay  
Save your tears for another  
I realize that I'm much too late  
And you deserve someone better  
Save your tears for another day  
Ooh yeah  
Save your tears for another day  
Yeah  
I don't know why I run away  
I'll make you cry when I run away  
Save your tears for another day ooh girl  
Ah  
I said save your tears for another day  
Ah  
Save your tears for another day  
Ah  
Save your tears for another day  
Ah
