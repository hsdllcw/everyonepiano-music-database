### Like It's Christmas歌词：

Da-dom-dom-dom-dom  
The snow on the ground  
The love in the air  
Slay bells are ringing  
This is what it's all about  
The fire is warm  
The angels are singing  
And I don't wanna miss a single thing  
Don't wanna put end to all this cheer  
But as long as you're with me  
It's always the time of the year  
You make every day feel like it's Christmas  
Never wanna stop  
Feelin' like the first thing on your wish list  
Right up at the top  
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside  
Nothin' fake about the way you bring me to life  
You make every day feel like it's Christmas  
Every day that I'm with you  
Look at the lights  
Twinklin' bright 24/7  
Every inch of Central Park  
Is covered in white  
This could be heaven  
And I don't wanna miss a single thing  
Don't wanna put end to all this cheer  
But as long as you're with me  
It's always the time of the year yeah  
Woo  
You make every day feel like it's Christmas  
Like it's Christmas  
Never wanna stop  
Feelin' like the first thing on your wish list  
Right up at the top  
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside  
Nothin' fake about the way you bring me to life  
You make every day feel like it's Christmas  
Every day that I'm with you  
Woo woo-woo  
Yeah  
Every day that I'm with you  
Every day every night  
You make every day feel like it's Christmas  
Never wanna stop  
Feelin' like the first thing on your wish list  
Right up at the top  
I can't deny  
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside  
Nothin' fake about the way you bring me to life  
You make every day feel like it's Christmas  
Every day that I'm with you  
Hey hey yeah yeah  
Baby  
La-la-la  
I can't deny what I'm feeling inside  
No matter the reason no matter decision  
My heart will keep beating you better believe  
You make every day feel like it's Christmas  
Like it's Christmas  
Every day that I'm with you  
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
Every day that I'm with you  
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
Every day that I'm with you
