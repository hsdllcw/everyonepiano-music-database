### Never Really Over歌词：

I'm losing my self control  
Yeah you start and I trickle back in  
But I don't wanna fall down the rabbit hole  
Cross my heart I won't do it again  
I tell myself tell myself tell myself "Draw the line"  
And I do I do  
But once in a while I trip up and I cross the line  
And I think of you  
Two years and just like that  
My head still takes me back  
Thought it was done but I  
Guess it's never really over  
Oh we were such a mess  
But wasn't it the best  
Thought it was done but I  
Guess it's never really over  
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over  
And if I think it over maybe you'll be coming over again  
And I'll have to get over you all over again  
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over  
And if I think it over maybe you'll be coming over again  
And I'll have to get over you all over again  
I guess I could try hypnotherapy  
I gotta rewire this brain  
'Cause I can't even go on the internet  
Without even checking your name  
I tell myself tell myself tell myself "Draw the line"  
And I do I do  
But once in a while I trip up and I cross the line  
And I think of you  
Two years and just like that  
My head still takes me back  
Thought it was done but I  
Guess it's never really over  
Oh we were such a mess  
But wasn't it the best  
Thought it was done but I  
Guess it's never really over  
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over  
And if I think it over maybe you'll be coming over again  
And I'll have to get over you all over again  
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over  
And if I think it over maybe you'll be coming over again  
And I'll have to get over you all over again  
Thought we kissed goodbye  
Thought we meant this time was the last  
But I guess it's never really over  
Thought we drew the line right through you and I  
Can't keep going back I guess it's never really over yeah  
Two years and just like that  
My head still takes me back  
Thought it was done but I  
Guess it's never really over  
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over  
And if I think it over maybe you'll be coming over again  
And I'll have to get over you all over again  
And I'll have to get over you all over again  
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over  
And if I think it over maybe you'll be coming over again  
And I'll have to get over you all over again  
Over you all over again  
Thought we kissed goodbye  
Thought we meant this time was the last  
But I guess it's never really over  
Thought we drew the line right through you and I  
Can't keep going back  
I guess it's never really over
