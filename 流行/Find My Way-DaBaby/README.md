### Find My Way歌词：

Wait a minute who are you  
Ayy yo K.i.D  
I keep it loaded when I ride 'cause I'm still a n***a  
I f**k with her to ease my mind 'cause I be in my feelings  
And every single person in my life tell me I'm their hero  
But when it's up and it go down they treat me like the villain  
Guess I forgot to mention  
I'm just a n***a with a broken heart tryna find my way back home back home  
And I'm sittin' here with the car in park while she ride d**k to my song ooh  
I know the feelin' ain't it okay  
You ever feel the way I feel you know it feel amazin' let's go  
I had a b***h we used to kick it she was feelin' Baby mwah mwah mwah  
She stepped on my heart had me feelin' basic D**n  
You know how people like to come back when you level up uh-huh  
I made the change you stayed the same I gotta ahead of ya  
Guess I been tryin' to free up some time in my schedule but uh-huh  
When opportunity knockin' I never say no  
'Cause I been busy catchin' the blessing I used to pray for let's go  
Stackin' up the bag and like Tetris we playin' LEGOs  
And everyday I pray to God that a n***a don't try to play though  
'Cause I don't like to play beat and gave a n***a a halo Boom boom boom  
Thinkin' 'bout the people I lost know I got some angels  
Chillin' with my freak when we f**k it ease my anger  
Takin' selfies with my b***h she keep switchin' up different angles  
And no I never kept me a b***h but I always keep me a banger boom boom  
I keep it loaded when I ride 'cause I'm still a n***a ah  
I f**k with her to ease my mind 'cause I been in my feelings  
And every single person in my life tell me I'm their hero  
But when it's up and it go down they treat me like the villain  
Guess I forgot to mention  
I'm just a n***a with a broken heart tryna find my way back home back home  
I'm sittin' here with the car in park while she ride d**k to my song ooh  
I let her ride again  
She spread her legs and open up I end up slidin' in okay  
She know the s**t excitin' you is not excitin' him me  
She swallow me up every mornin' like a vitamin yup  
He know to come look where I'm at he wanna find his b***h she with me  
Know I'm aggressive when she kiss me like to bite her lip brr  
I don't be makin' love songs it don't excite a jit no  
Real n***a I got feelings I'm not hiding it Okay let's go  
Still pimpin' tell the b***h I really like her friend Yeah b***h  
You know the pussy good 'cause I be tryna fly it in Yeah b***h  
I text her once she don't respond I won't say Hi again b***h  
She kiss me once and let me slide I never lie again Let's go  
My name not Melly I got murder on my mind again uh-huh  
I'm with the s**ts I kill him twice if he could die again  
And if you think 'bout tryin' me better try again  
'Cause I'ma let him spin if he don't drop then we gon' slide again doo doo doo
doo  
I keep it loaded when I ride 'cause I'm still a n***a ah  
I f**k with her to use my mind 'cause I be in my feelings  
And every single person in my life tell me I'm their hero  
But when it's up and it go down they treat me like the villain  
Guess I forgot to mention  
I'm just a n***a with a broken heart tryna find my way back home back  
I'm sittin' here with the car in park while she ride d**k to my song b***h
