### So Will I歌词：

You say "What if I go crazy"  
I say "That ain't gonna happen"  
You say "What if I get lost"  
I say "You'll just find your way back"  
And you say "What if someone breaks my heart"  
"I'll put it back together like I do"  
You say "What if I don't catch the dreams  
That I've been out there chasing  
What if when my fears show up  
I'm too afraid to face them"  
Well I can't fight your battles  
But I sure can hold your hand and promise you  
That the sky will still be up there  
And the sun will always shine  
The stars will keep on fallin'  
For the ones who wish at night  
The mountains won't start moving  
And the rivers won't run dry  
The world will always be there  
And so will I  
Will I will I  
Will I will I  
You say "What if things start changing"  
I say "We'll be changing with 'em  
We'll just sing a different melody  
And dance a different rhythm"  
You say "What if I give up"  
I say "That's one thing that I'll never let you do"  
You say "What if someone leaves me  
And they leave me empty-handed"  
I say "Losing only teaches you  
To not take things for granted  
No I can't just bring 'em back  
But darling I can hold your hand and promise you"  
That the sky will still be up there  
And the sun will always shine  
The stars will keep on fallin'  
For the ones who wish at night  
The mountains won't start moving  
And the rivers won't run dry  
The world will always be there  
And so will I  
Will I will I  
Will I will I  
So will I I  
Will I will I  
Oh I  
Will I will I  
And so will I  
Will I will I  
I oh I  
Will I will I  
I and so will I  
So will I so will I  
I  
So will I so will I  
Even if the sky is fallin'  
And the sun don't always shine  
If the stars we used to wish on  
Disappear into the night  
Well I can move a mountain  
But only by your side  
Just say you'll always be there  
I know you'll always be there  
And so will I
