**Take It Off** 是美国女歌手Ke$ha演唱的一首电音舞曲，歌词、曲谱由Ke$ha、Dr. Luke、克劳德•凯利合作编写，Dr.
Luke、克劳德•凯利同时负责音乐出版。

该歌曲收录在Ke$ha于2010年1月05日发行的首张录音室专辑《Animal》，并作为推广专辑的第四支单曲，于2010年7月13日通过美国广播唱片公司发布。

《 _Take It Off_
》的创作灵感，是Ke$ha在晚上所去的一家同志酒吧里得到的。当时，Ke$ha身边的人都脱的干干净净，唯有她穿了一件比基尼，这首歌就是因他们而生。该歌曲录制于美国洛杉矶的康威录音工作室，在创作歌曲的过程中，Ke$ha独自填写歌词，卢克博士（Dr.
Luke）和克劳德•凯利负责创作音乐伴奏，前者包揽了鼓、键盘乐器以及编排歌曲音乐的工作，后者则与The Pickleheadz担任起伴唱歌手一职。

《Take It
Off》是一首以乐观心态占主导地位的流行电音舞曲，歌曲拥有朗朗上口的旋律和Ke$ha压抑愤怒情绪似的歌唱，歌词内容体现了无忧无虑、无情到极致的享乐主义，并宣告庆祝邪恶的黑暗力量。在歌曲中，Ke$ha的歌声被过度加工、修饰及调整，其音乐节拍是持续不断的电音鼓点以及些许的碎拍。

### Take It Off歌词：

There's a place downtown where the freaks all come around  
It's a hole in the wall, it's a dirty free for all  
When they  
When the dark of the night comes around  
That's the time  
That the animal comes alive  
Looking for something wild  
And now we lookin' like pimps in my gold Trans Am  
Got a water bottle full of whiskey in my handbag  
Got my drunk text on, I'll regret it in the morning  
But tonight, I don't give a  
There's a place downtown where the freaks all come around  
It's a hole in the wall, it's a dirty free for all  
And they turn me on when they take it off  
When they take it off, everybody take it off  
There's a place I know, if you're looking for a show  
Where they go hardcore and there's glitter on the floor  
And they turn me on when they take it off  
When they take it off, everybody take it off  
Lose your mind, lose it now  
Lose your clothes in the crowd  
We're delirious, tear it down  
Till the sun comes back around  
Now we gettin' so smashed, knockin' over trash cans  
Everybody breakin' bottles, it's a filthy hot mess  
And I'm gonna get faded, I'm not the designated driver  
So I don't give a  
There's a place downtown where the freaks all come around  
It's a hole in the wall, it's a dirty free for all  
And they turn me on when they take it off  
When they take it off, everybody take it off  
There's a place I know, if you're looking for a show  
Where they go hardcore and there's glitter on the floor  
And they turn me on when they take it off  
When they take it off, everybody take it off  
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh  
Everybody take it off!  
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh  
Everybody take it off!  
Right now, take it off! Right now, take it off!  
Right now, take it off! Oh  
Right now, take it off! Right now, take it off!  
Right now, take it off! Oh, oh  
Everybody take it off!  
There's a place downtown where the freaks all come around  
It's a hole in the wall, it's a dirty free for all  
And they turn me on when they take it off  
When they take it off, everybody take it off  
There's a place I know, if you're looking for a show  
Where they go hardcore and there's glitter on the floor  
And they turn me on when they take it off  
When they take it off, everybody take it off
