### Grade 8歌词：

My mind is a warrior,  
My heart is a foreigner,  
My eyes are the colour of red like a sunset,  
I'll never keep it bottled up  
And left to the hands of the coroner,  
Be a true heart not a follower,  
We're not done yet.  
And I see it in your movements tonight,  
If we should ever do this right,  
I'm never gonna let you down,  
Oh I'll never let you down,  
Now keep it on the down low  
And I'll keep you around so I'll know  
That I'll never let you down,  
I'll never let you down.  
You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I've never
felt this way,  
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down,  
Now you're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I've
never felt this way,  
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down,  
Now, my eyes are a river filler,  
This drink is a liver killer,  
My chest is a pillow for your weary head to lay to rest again,  
Your body is my ballpoint pen  
And your mind is my new best friend,  
Your eyes are the mirror to take me to the edge again,  
Now I see it in your movements tonight,  
If we should ever do this right,  
I'm never gonna let you down,  
Oh I'll never let you down,  
We'll keep it on the down low  
And I'll keep you around so I'll know  
That I'll never let you down,  
I'll never let you down,  
You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I've never
felt this way,  
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down,  
You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I've never
felt this way,  
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down,  
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now, and I'll never let you down
[x4]  
'Cause You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I've
never felt this way,  
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down,  
You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I've never
felt this way,  
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down
