### Taunt歌词：

She's always asking  
Am I alright  
As if auspicious or in my pint  
I'll find the answer or a good night  
Thank God the time is short  
And yes you always do that one thing  
When you wrinkle up the nose bridge  
I'm trying to figure out what that meant  
I took it as a taunt  
Remember way back then in school  
Oh did anybody ever say no to you  
Oh did anybody ever say no to you  
Whoa  
And I don't think I have a clue  
'Cause well did anybody ever say no to you  
Oh did anybody ever say no to you  
Whoa  
You're always trying to leave the table  
Phone calls toilet breaks unstable  
And don't you think that we can all tell  
You're insecure you're insecure  
I guess I always do that one thing  
When I get too drunk and jump in  
To figure out what makes your brain tick  
I'm a listener I'm a listener  
Remember way back then in school  
'Cause well did anybody ever say no to you  
Oh did anybody ever say no to you  
Whoa  
But I don't think I have a clue  
'Cause well did anybody ever say no to you  
Oh did anybody ever say no to you  
Whoa  
Woo  
And I don't think so  
'Cause I don't think so  
Forget the number for the cab call  
As you're dashing out the front door  
You claim to try to dodge the catcalls  
Thank God the time is short  
And yes you always do that one thing  
'Cause when you throw and  
Drench me under your drink  
I'm trying to figure out what that means  
I took it as a taunt
