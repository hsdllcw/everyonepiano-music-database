### Ghost歌词：

I keep going to the river to pray  
'Cos I need something that can wash out the pain  
And at most  
I'm sleeping all these demons away  
But your ghost, the ghost of you  
It keeps me awake  
My friends had you figured out  
Yeah they saw what's inside of you  
you tried to hide in another you  
But your evil was coming through  
These eyes sitting on the wall  
Well they watch every move I make  
Bright light living in the shade  
Your cold heart makes my spirit shake  
I had to go through hell to prove I'm not insane  
Had to meet the devil just to know his name  
And that's when my love was burning  
Yeah it's still burning  
I keep going to the river to pray  
'Cos I need something that can wash out the pain  
And at most  
I'm sleeping all these demons away  
But your ghost, the ghost of you  
It keeps me awake  
I keep going to the river to pray  
'Cos I need something that can wash out the pain  
And at most  
I'm sleeping all these demons away  
But your ghost, the ghost of you  
It keeps me awake  
Each time that I think you go  
I turn round and you're creeping in  
And I let you under my skin  
'Cos I love living in the sin  
Oh you never told me  
True love was gonna hurt  
True pain, i don't deserve  
Truth is that I never learned  
I keep going to the river to pray  
'Cos I need something that can wash out the pain  
And at most  
I'm sleeping all these demons away  
But your ghost, the ghost of you  
It keeps me awake  
I keep going to the river to pray  
'Cos I need something that can wash out the pain  
And at most  
I'm sleeping all these demons away  
But your ghost, the ghost of you  
It keeps me awake  
Give up the ghost  
Give up the ghost  
Give up the ghost  
Stop the haunting baby  
Give up the ghost  
Give up the ghost  
Give up the ghost  
No more haunting baby  
I keep going to the river  
I keep going to the river to pray  
'Cos I need something that can wash out the pain  
And at most  
I'm sleeping all these demons away  
But your ghost, the ghost of you  
It keeps me awake  
I keep going to the river to pray  
'Cos I need something that can wash out the pain  
And at most  
I'm sleeping all these demons away  
But your ghost, the ghost of you  
It keeps me awake
