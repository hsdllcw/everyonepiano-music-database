### Lie to Me歌词：

Luke：  
I saw you looking brand new overnight  
And I caught you looking too but you didn't look twice  
You look happy oh mmm  
You look happy oh  
Luke/Calum：  
Flashing back to New York City  
Change your flight so you'd stay with me  
Remember thinking that I got this right  
And now I wish we never met  
'Cause you're too hard to forget  
While I'm cleaning up your mess  
I know he's taking off your dress  
And I know that you don't but if I ask you if you love me  
I hope you lie lie lie lie lie to me  
Julia Michaels：  
It's 3 AM and the moonlight's testing me  
Ah  
I know that you've been holding on to someone else  
And now I can't sleep  
Ah  
I ain't happy oh  
I ain't too happy oh  
Julia Michaels：  
Flashing back to New York City  
I was done but you undid me  
Classic me to run when it feels right  
Luke/Julia Michaels：  
Now I wish we never met  
'Cause you're too hard to forget  
While he's taking off my dress  
I know she's laying on your chest  
I know that you don't but if I ask you if you love me  
I hope you lie lie lie lie lie to me  
Singing lie lie lie lie lie  
Li-li-lie lie lie lie lie  
Lie lie lie lie lie lie  
Lie lie lie lie lie lie  
Yeah yeah  
I know that you don't but if I ask you if you love me  
I hope you lie lie lie lie lie to me
