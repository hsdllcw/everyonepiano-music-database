### Amazing歌词：

I kept the right ones out  
And let the wrong ones in  
Had an angel of mercy to see me through all my sins  
There were times in my life  
When I was goin' insane  
Tryin' to walk through  
The pain  
When I lost my grip  
And I hit the floor  
Yeah, I thought I could leave but couldn't get out the door  
I was so sick and tired  
Of a livin' a lie  
I was wishin' that I  
Would die  
It's Amazing  
It's Amazing  
With the blink of an eye you finally see the light  
With the blink of an eye you finally see the light  
It's Amazing  
It's Amazing  
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright  
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright  
It's Amazing  
It's Amazing  
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight  
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight  
That one last shot's a Permanent Vacation  
And how high can you fly with broken wings?  
Life's a journey not a destination  
And I just can't tell just what tomorrow brings  
You have to learn to crawl  
Before you learn to walk  
But I just couldn't liten to all that righteous talk  
I was out on the street,  
Just a tryin' to survive
