### Crazy歌词：

Come Here baby  
You know you drive me up a wall the way you make good on all the  
nasty tricks you pull  
Seems like we're makin' up more than we're makin' love  
And it always seems you got somn' on your mind other than me  
Girl, you got to change your crazy ways  
You hear me

Say you're leavin' on a seven thirty train and that you're headin'  
out to Hollywood  
Girl you been givin' me that line so many times it kinda gets like  
feelin' bad looks good

That kinda lovin'  
Turns a man to a slave  
That kinda lovin'  
Sends a man right to his grave...

[Chorus:]  
I go crazy, crazy, baby, I go crazy  
You turn it on  
Then you're gone  
Yeah you drive me  
Crazy, crazy, crazy, for you baby  
What can I do, honey  
I feel like the color blue...

You're packin' up your stuff and talkin' like it's tough and tryin'  
to tell me that it's time to go  
But I know you ain't wearin' nothin' underneath that overcoat  
And it's all a show

That kind of lovin'  
Makes me wanna pull  
Down the shade, yeah  
That kind of lovin'  
Yeah now I'm never, never, never, never gonna be the same  
[Chorus]

I'm losin' my mind, girl  
'Cause I'm goin' crazy

I need your love, honey  
I need your love

Crazy, crazy, crazy, I go crazy  
You turn it on  
Then you're gone  
Yeah you drive me  
Crazy, crazy, crazy, for you baby  
I'm losin' my mind, girl  
ÔÃause I'm goin' crazy  
Crazy, crazy, crazy for you baby  
You turn it on, then your gone  
Yeah you drive me
