### You & I歌词：

I figured it out.  
I figured it out from black and white.  
Seconds and hours.  
Maybe they had to take some time.

I know how it goes.  
I know how it goes from wrong and right.  
Silence and sound.  
Did they ever hold each other tight  
Like us?  
Did they ever fight  
Like us?

You and I.  
We don't wanna be like them.  
We can make it 'til the end.  
Nothing can come between  
You and I.  
Not even the Gods above  
Can separate the two of us.  
No, nothing can come between  
You and I.

Oh, you and I.

I figured it out.  
Saw the mistakes of up and down.  
Meet in the middle.  
There's always room for common ground.

I see what it's like.  
I see what it's like for day and night.  
Never together  
'Cause they see things in a different light  
Like us.  
But they never tried  
Like us.

You and I.  
We don't wanna be like them.  
We can make it 'til the end.  
Nothing can come between  
You and I.  
Not even the Gods above  
Can separate the two of us.

'Cause you and I...

We don't wanna be like them.  
We can make it 'til the end.  
Nothing can come between  
You and I.  
Not even the Gods above  
Can separate the two of us.  
No, nothing can come between  
You and I.

You and I.  
Oh, you and I.  
Oh, you and I.  
We can make it if we try.  
You and I  
Oh, you and I.
