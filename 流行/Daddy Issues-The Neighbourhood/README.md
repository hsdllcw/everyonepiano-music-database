### Daddy Issues歌词：

Take you like a drug  
I taste you on my tongue  
You ask me what I'm thinking about  
I tell you that I'm thinking about  
Whatever you're thinking about  
Tell me something that I'll forget  
And you might have to tell me again  
It's crazy what you do for a friend  
Go ahead and cry little girl  
Nobody does it like you do  
I know how much it matters to you  
I know that you got daddy issues  
And if you were my little girl  
I'd do whatever I could do  
I'd run away and hide with you  
I love that you got daddy issues  
And I do too  
I tried to write your name in the rain  
But the rain never came  
So I made with the sun  
The shade always comes at the worst times  
You ask me what I'm thinking about  
I'll tell you that I'm thinking about  
Whatever you're thinking about  
Tell me something that I'll forget  
And you might have to tell me again  
It's crazy what you do for a friend  
Go ahead and cry little girl  
Nobody does it like you do  
I know how much it matters to you  
I know that you got daddy issues  
And if you were my little girl  
I'd do whatever I could do  
I'd run away and hide with you  
I love that you got daddy issues  
I keep on trying to let you go  
Dying to let you know  
How I'm getting on  
I didn't cry when you left at first  
But now that you're dead it hurts  
This time I gotta know  
Where did my daddy go  
I'm not entirely here  
Half of me has disappeared  
Go ahead and cry little boy  
You know that your daddy did too  
You know what your mama went through  
You gotta let it out soon just let it out  
Go ahead and cry little girl  
Nobody does it like you do  
I know how much it matters to you  
I know that you got daddy issues  
And if you were my little girl  
I'd do whatever I could do  
I'd run away and hide with you  
I love that you got daddy issues  
And I do too  
And if you were my little girl  
I'd do whatever I could do  
I'd run away and hide with you  
I love that you got daddy issues  
And I do too
