### Skrt On Me歌词：

Young money  
Said baby no no no no no  
You know my loving ain't free babe  
Won't make you do what you don't wanna do  
What you don't wanna do no that ain't me babe  
Said baby nah nah nah I ain't with the drama  
That ain't what I need  
I need your tin heart now need your ten toes down baby  
Said if you ride baby ride up  
Pull up from behind baby wine up  
And you and me we can shine up  
So baby come make your mind up  
Said if you ride baby ride up  
Pull up from behind baby wine up  
And you and me we can shine up  
So baby come make your mind up  
Baby babe I need you to skrt on me babe  
Drop down luv seh you nuh eye me don't know  
'Cause you keep telling me your love ain't free babe  
But if you with it wine up on me  
'Cause the hips don't lie baby  
Drop down luv seh you nuh eye me don't know  
'Cause you keep telling me your love ain't free babe  
Said baby I I I got so used to it being on a creep babe  
Yeah maybe I I I got so used to just giving you the least babe  
But nowadays I need more from ya  
I need something I can keep  
Said nowadays I need real  
Nowadays I need you to take the lead  
Said if you ride baby ride up  
Pull up from behind baby wine up  
And you and me we can shine up  
So baby come make your mind up  
Said if you ride baby ride up  
Pull up from behind baby wine up  
And you and me we can shine up  
So baby come make your mind up  
Baby babe I need you to skrt on me babe  
Drop down luv seh you nuh eye me don't know  
'Cause you keep telling me your love ain't free babe  
But if you with it wine up on me  
'Cause the hips don't lie baby  
Drop down luv seh you nuh eye me don't know  
'Cause you keep telling me your love ain't free babe  
Ay yo bring in the blunt Emily Blunt  
Platinum back ice bling in the front  
I'ma lay in the jump Yao Ming in the dunk  
And I'm playing the field brad wing in the punt  
I'ma tell him I love him in a foreign and cuff him  
Whips and immigration everything on him it's custom  
Now they calling me Billy I'm the goat  
No Achilles heel since I left philly  
Countin' them millis to billis  
Beep beep beep beep put the hurt on me  
Yeah I'm wearing jeans but he put the skirt on me  
Rode him to sleep and then I put his shirt on me  
Pussy clean these niggas ain't got no dirt on me  
Gotta play it by my rules so I swerve on him  
Got my cash money you can ask bird or slim  
Took him to my paradise so he grippin' my linen  
Now he got a big thing for Caribbean women  
Baby babe I need you to skrt on me babe  
Drop down luv seh you nuh eye me don't know  
'Cause you keep telling me your love ain't free babe  
But if you with it wine up on me  
'Cause the hips don't lie baby  
Drop down luv seh you nuh eye me don't know  
'Cause you keep telling me your love ain't free babe  
Baby babe I need you to skrt on me babe  
Drop down luv seh you nuh eye me don't know  
'Cause you keep telling me your love ain't free babe  
But if you with it wine up on me  
'Cause the hips don't lie baby  
Drop down luv seh you nuh eye me don't know  
'Cause you keep telling me your love ain't free babe
