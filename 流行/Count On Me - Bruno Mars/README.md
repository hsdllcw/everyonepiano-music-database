作词：Philip Lawrence、Ari Levine、Bruno Mars  
作曲：Philip Lawrence、Ari Levine、Bruno Mars

If you ever find yourself stuck in the middle of the sea,  
I'll sail the world to find you  
If you ever find yourself lost in the dark and you can't see,  
I'll be the light to guide you  
Find out what we're made of  
When we are called to help our friends in need  
You can count on me like 1 2 3  
I'll be there  
And I know when I need it I can count on you like 4 3 2  
And you'll be there  
Cause that's what friends are supposed to do, oh yeah  
Wooooh, Wooooh  
yeah Yeah  
If you toss and you turn and you just can't fall asleep  
I'll sing a song  
beside you  
And if you ever forget how much you really mean to me  
Everyday I will  
remind you  
Ohh  
Find out what we're made of  
When we are called to help our friends in need  
You can count on me like 1 2 3  
I'll be there  
And I know when I need it I can count on you like 4 3 2  
You'll be there  
Cause that's what friends are supposed to do, oh yeah  
Wooooh, Wooooh  
Yeah Yeah  
You'll always have my shoulder when you cry  
I'll never let go  
Never say goodbye  
You can count on me like 1 2 3  
I'll be there  
And I know when I need it I can count on you like 4 3 2  
You'll be there  
Cause that's what friends are supposed to do, oh yeah  
You can count on me like 1 2 3  
I'll be there  
And I know when I need it I can count on you like 4 3 2  
You'll be there  
Cause that's what friends are supposed to do, oh yeah  
you can count on me cos' I can count on you
