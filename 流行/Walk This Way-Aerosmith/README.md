### Walk This Way歌词：

Backstroke lover always hidin' 'neath the cover  
'Till I talked to my daddy he say  
He said, "You ain't seen noting  
'Till you're down on a muffin  
Then you're sure to be a-changin' your ways"

I met a cheerleader, was a real young bleeder  
All the times I can reminisce  
Ah the best thing lovin'  
With her sister and her cousin  
Started with a little kiss, like this

See-saw swingin' with the boys in the school  
With your feet flyin' up in the air  
Singin' hey diddle-diddle with the kitty in the middle  
You be swingin' like you just didn't care

So I took a big chance at the high school dance  
With a missy who was ready to play  
Was it me she was foolin'?  
'Cause she knew what she was doin'  
Taught me how to walk this way  
She told me to

"Walk this way, talk this way  
Walk this way, talk this way  
Walk this way, talk this way  
Walk this way, talk this way"  
Ah, just give me a kiss  
Gimme some, gimme some, gimme some, yeah

School girl sadie with the classy kinda sassy  
Little skirt climbing way up her knees  
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker  
When I noticed they was lookin' at me

I was a high school loser  
Never made it with a lady  
Till the boys told me something I missed  
Then my next door neighbour  
With a daughter had a favour  
Took me just a little kiss, like this

See-saw swingin' with the boys in the school  
With your feet flyin' up in the air  
Singin' hey diddle-diddle with the kitty in the middle  
You be swingin' like you just didn't care

So I took a big chance at the high school dance  
With a missy who was ready to play  
Was it me she was foolin'?  
'Cause she knew what she was doin'  
Told me how to walk this way  
She told me to

"Walk this way, talk this way  
Walk this way, talk this way  
Walk this way, talk this way  
Walk this way, talk this way"  
Just give me a kiss
