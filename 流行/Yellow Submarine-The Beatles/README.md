### Yellow Submarine歌词：

In the town  
where I was born  
Lived a man  
who sailed to sea  
And he told  
us of his life  
In the land  
of submarines  
So wo sailed  
up to the sun  
Till we found  
the sea of green  
And we lived  
beneath the waves  
In our yellow  
submarine  
We all live in a yellow submarine,  
yellow submarine,  
yellow submarine  
We all live in a yellow submarine,  
yellow submarine,  
yellow submarine  
And our friends  
are all on board  
Many more of them  
live next door  
And the band  
begins to play  
We all live in a yellow submarine,  
yellow submarine,  
yellow submarine  
We all live in a yellow submarine,  
yellow submarine,  
yellow submarine  
As we live  
a life of ease  
Everyone of us  
has all we need  
Sky of blue  
and sea of green  
In our yelllow  
submarine  
We all live in a yellow submarine,  
yellow submarine,  
yellow submarine  
We all live in a yellow submarine,  
yellow submarine,  
yellow submarine  
We all live in a yellow submarine,  
yellow submarine,  
yellow submarine  
We all live in a yellow submarine,  
yellow submarine,  
yellow submarine
