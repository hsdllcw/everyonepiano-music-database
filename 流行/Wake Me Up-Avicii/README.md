《 **Wake Me Up** 》（Piano Quick Riff）是瑞典歌手Avicii于2013年发行的单曲。

Avicii 原名Tim Bergling，中文译名：艾维斯。1989年9月8日出生于瑞典的斯德哥尔摩省。自小迷恋音乐的他对电音舞曲情有独钟，受到了Daft
Punk的熏陶，加上瑞典地区发达的电音产业让他萌生了成为DJ的念头。

2008年，不满20岁的Avicii开始尝试为游戏[Commodore 64]制作主题曲，这促使他创作出了自己的第一支单曲《Lazy
Jones》，该曲在Strike
Recordings发行后立刻引起轰动，只是牛刀小试的瑞典少年得到了众多新老DJ的称赞，他们惊讶这位18岁年轻人的处子作居然如此专业和迎合时代潮流。很快，Avicii被英国老牌House天王Pete
Tong注意。在前辈的力邀下，Avicii的第二首单曲《Manman》在Pete Tong的节目[First
Trax]当中成为主打，超过七成的听众支持率让Bergling一下子成为炙手可热的明日之星。不到两年的时间，Avicii俨然成为Vicious
Grooves最高产艺人。

### Wake Me Up歌词：

演唱：Avici

Feeling my way through the darkness  
Guided by a beating heart  
I can't tell where the journey will end  
But I know where to start

They tell me I'm too young to understand  
They say I'm caught up in a dream  
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes  
Well that's fine by me

So wake me up when it's all over  
When I'm wiser and I'm older  
All this time I was finding myself  
And I didn't know I was lost  
So wake me up when it's all over  
When I'm wiser and I'm older  
All this time I was finding myself  
And I didn't know I was lost

I tried carrying the weight of the world  
But I only have two hands  
Hope I get the chance to travel the world  
But I don't have any plans

Wish that I could stay forever this young  
Not afraid to close my eyes  
Life's a game made for everyone  
And love is the prize

So wake me up when it's all over  
When I'm wiser and I'm older  
All this time I was finding myself  
And I didn't know I was lost  
So wake me up when it's all over  
When I'm wiser and I'm older  
All this time I was finding myself  
And I didn't know I was lost

Didn't know I was lost  
I didn't know I was lost  
I didn't know I was lost  
I didn't know
