**Sound of Walking Away**
是美国音乐家DJ和唱片制作人ILLENIUM与爱沙尼亚歌手Kerli一同合作的单曲。收录在ILLENIUM的第二张录音室专辑Awake中。

It's the Sound of Walking
Away，这是决然离开的声音。很多人知道甜甜的恋爱，但都没吃过恋爱的苦；故事最开始总是甜的，某一天开始，他/她因为种种变得对你不理不睬，就像感受不到你的爱一样，而你就这样毫无答复的继续爱他/她。坚持着，回想着曾经的甜蜜，期望着不再有回应。这样毫无回应的爱终究没有结果，最终你只能选择放弃。而这就是你决然离开的声音。

### Sound of Walking Away歌词：

I've been quiet aside you  
While my heart in my chest shouts  
Feeling silenced and lied to  
But enough is enough now  
Don't come find me I won't be here waiting  
I so can do it alone you're not worth staying  
Weren't listening but now there's no way you won't hear  
There's a voice emerging in the night so loud and clear  
I'll turn it up like you turn me down I'm not afraid  
Hit play hit play  
It's the sound of walking away  
It's the sound of walking away  
It's the sound of walking away  
It's the sound of walking away  
I've been drowning inside you  
While my love it just pours out  
I've been running behind you  
But enough is enough now  
Don't come find me I won't be here waiting  
I so can do it alone you're not worth staying  
Weren't listening but now there's no way you won't hear  
There's a voice emerging in the night so loud and clear  
I'll turn it up like you turn me down I'm not afraid  
Hit play hit play  
It's the sound of walking away  
It's the sound of walking away  
It's the sound of walking away
