### Here with Me歌词：

Can I tell you something just between you and me  
When I hear your voice I know I'm finally free  
Every single word is perfect as it can be  
And I need you here with me  
When you lift me up I know that I'll never fall  
I can speak to you by saying nothing at all  
Every single time I find it harder to breathe  
'Cause I need you here with me  
Every day  
You're saying the words that I want you to say  
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away  
Now I know I'm falling in deep  
'Cause I need you here with me  
Every day  
You're saying the words that I want you to say  
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away  
Now I know I'm falling in deep  
'Cause I need you here with me  
I think I see your face in every place that I go  
I try to hide it but I know that it's gonna show  
Every single night I find it harder to sleep  
'Cause I need you here with me  
Everyday  
You're saying the words that I want you to say  
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away  
Now I know I'm falling in deep  
'Cause I need you here with me  
Every day  
You're saying the words that I want you to say  
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away  
Now I know I'm falling in deep  
'Cause I need you here with me  
Can I tell you something just between you and me  
When I hear your voice I know I'm finally free  
Every single word is perfect as it can be  
'Cause I need you here with me
