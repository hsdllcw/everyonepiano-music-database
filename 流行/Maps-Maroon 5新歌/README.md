### Maps歌词：

I miss the days to the sweet lie  
I miss the conversation  
I'm such a fool of song tonight  
I'm changing of all the stations  
I like to think did we had it all  
We drove 'em out to the better days  
But I'm not running I'm super fun  
Oh baby why did you run away  
I was there for you  
In you darkest times  
I was there for you  
In your darkest nights  
But I wonder where were you  
When I was at my worst  
Down on my knees  
And instead of my having back  
So I wonder where were you  
All the worse you took came back to me  
So I'm following the map that leads to you  
The map that leads to you  
And nothing I can do  
The map that leads to you  
Following, following, following to you  
The map that leads to you  
And nothing I can do  
The map that leads to you  
Following, following, following  
I hear your voice at my sleeping night  
Hard to resist temptation  
Cause all the strangers come over me  
Now I can't get over you  
No I just can't get over you  
I was there for you  
In you darkest times  
I was there for you  
In your darkest nights  
But I wonder where were you  
When I was at my worst  
Down on my knees  
And instead of my having back  
So I wonder where were you  
All the worse you took came back to me  
So I'm following the map that leads to you  
The map that leads to you  
And nothing I can do  
The map that leads to you  
Following, following, following to you  
The map that leads to you  
And nothing I can do  
The map that leads to you  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh  
Oh I was there for you  
Oh In you darkest times  
Oh I was there for you  
Oh In your darkest nights  
Oh I was there for you  
Oh In you darkest times  
Oh I was there for you  
Oh In your darkest nights  
But I wonder where were you  
When I was at my worst  
Down on my knees  
And instead of my having back  
So I wonder where were you  
All the worse you took came back to me  
So I'm following the map that leads to you  
The map that leads to you  
And nothing I can do  
The map that leads to you  
Following, following, following to you  
The map that leads to you  
And nothing I can do  
The map that leads to you  
Following, following, following
