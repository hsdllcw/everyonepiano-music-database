**Living Proof双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Living Proof_ 出自古巴裔美国流行乐歌手、词曲作者Camila
Cabello的第二张录音室专辑Romance。歌曲有一点嬉皮的前奏，带着背景持续的单人鼓掌声，混合着Camila独特的性感嗓音交错渐进，直到高潮假声的完全爆发，将一个欢快而又放飞自我的形象表现到极致。节奏均匀的drumbeat，在加强节奏的同时没有过多复杂的伴奏参入，而注重突出Camila穿透力极强的嗓音，再加上令人耳目一新的极致假声，不愧是特立独行的Camila。

### Living Proof歌词：

Ooh  
Tell me something but say it with your hands slow  
When you touch me paint me like a Van Gogh  
I wanna study every inch of you  
'Til you trust me to make the angels come through  
Like a choir singing "Hallelujah"  
When my body's crashin' right into you  
When we align do you do you feel me  
Can you feel me  
'Cause I can't breathe  
Where did you come from baby  
And were you sent to save me  
Ooh he's guarding every move  
Ooh and yet a living proof  
The way your hands can't shake me  
Soft to the touch like baby  
Ooh he's guarding every move  
Ooh and yet a living proof  
Countin' freckles as they run down your spine  
Show your demons and I might show you mine  
One at a time yeah yeah  
What are you hidin'  
What a design yeah yeah  
I wanna dive in what a divine moment  
Can you feel me  
Oh  
Can you feel me  
Oh  
'Cause I can't breathe  
Where did you come from baby  
And were you sent to save me  
Ooh he's guarding every move  
Ooh and yet a living proof  
The way your hands can't shake me  
Soft to the touch like baby  
Ooh he's guarding every move  
Ooh and yet a living proof  
Like a choir singing "Hallelujah"  
Oh yeah choir singing "Hallelujah"  
Like a choir singing "Hallelujah"  
Hallelujah hallelujah  
Choir singing "Hallelujah"  
Body's crashin' right into you  
Oh  
Do you feel me  
Can you feel me  
'Cause I can't breathe  
Where did you come from baby  
And were you sent to save me  
Ooh he's guarding every move  
Oh  
Ooh and yet a living proof  
Living proof oh  
The way your hands can't shake me  
Soft to the touch like baby  
Ooh he's guarding every move  
Ooh and yet a living proof  
Like a choir singing "Hallelujah"  
Choir singing "Hallelujah"  
Baby  
Like a choir singing "Hallelujah"  
Hallelujah  
And yet a living proof
