### Bedless歌词：

Surf to me  
Whatever you want  
And whenever you're breezing through  
Keep tearing my world apart  
As we lost the light  
Wet cash on the bar  
She fell a victim to a violent wave  
And died on the jagged rocks

But don't believe it's a never-ending summer  
'Cause they don't exist  
Tied around your tongue in all the rage and spit  
So why am I the one falling apart?

'Cause you don't even know you're an angel  
Foolish am I for the times I come and go  
These stars defy love, so I close my eyes  
And sleep inside your worn-in bed outline

Splash over your body while you drown on me  
You ain't seen nothin' yet  
Enter the galaxy of our sober demise  
To the young and without type  
In the morning hear all the birds sing  
It never stops  
Then, with tears in your eyes  
You smiled dressed in Coppertone tan lines  
Oh oh I hope you don't regret me

Don't believe it's a never-ending summer  
'Cause they don't exist  
Tied around your tongue in all the rage and spit  
So why am I the one falling apart?

'Cause you don't even know you're an angel  
Foolish am I for the times I come and go  
These stars defy love, so I close my eyes  
And sleep inside your worn-in bed  
And it won't be long till we drop this match (oh)  
When I burn to your fingertips, you can throw what's left

So long, let's go and play those games you like  
Let's go and play those games you like

But don't believe  
'Cause yesterday I found her with her clothes still wet  
Crying in the shower on her knees she screamed  
"Why the fuck am I falling apart?"

'Cause you don't even know you're an angel  
Foolish am I for the times I come and go  
These stars defy love, so close my eyes  
I'll sleep inside your worn-in bed  
And it woke me up like a heart attack  
When you talk in your sleep I'll be there to slow your breath
