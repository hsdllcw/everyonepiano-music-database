### On the Line歌词：

[Verse 1:]  
[Demi]  
I didn't wanna say 'I'm sorry'  
For breaking us apart  
[Joe]  
I didn't wanna say 'It was my fault'  
Even though I knew it was  
[Demi]  
I didn't wanna call you back  
Cause I knew that I was wrong  
[Demi and Joe]  
Yeah I knew I was wrong

[Chorus:]  
[Demi]  
One in the same  
Never to change  
Our love was beautiful  
[Demi and Joe]  
We got it all  
Destined to fall  
Our love was tragical  
[Joe]  
Wanted to call  
[Demi]  
No need to fight  
[Joe]  
You know I wouldn't lie  
[Demi and Joe]  
But tonight, we'll leave it on the line

[Verse 2:]  
[Demi]  
Listen baby  
[Nick]  
Never would have said 'Forever'  
If I knew it'd end so fast  
[Demi]  
Why did you say 'I love you'  
If you knew it that it wouldn't last  
[Nick]  
Baby I just can't hear what your saying  
The line is breaking up  
[Demi]  
Or is that just us?  
Or is that just us?

[Chorus:]  
[Demi and Joe]  
One in the same  
Never to change  
Our love was beautiful  
We got it all  
Destined to fall  
Our love was tragical  
[Joe]  
Wanted to call  
[Demi]  
No need to fight  
[Joe]  
You know I wouldn't lie  
[Demi and Joe]  
But tonight, we'll leave it on the line

[Bridge:]  
[Joe]  
I try to call again  
I get your mailbox  
Like a letter left unread  
[Demi]  
Apologies are often open ended  
[Demi and Joe]  
But this one's better left unsaid

[Chorus:]  
[Demi and Joe]  
One in the same  
Never to change  
Our love was beautiful  
We got it all  
Destined to fall  
Our love was tragical  
[Joe]  
Wanted to call  
[Demi]  
No need to fight  
[Joe]  
You know I wouldn't lie  
[Demi and Joe]  
But tonight, we'll leave it on the line
