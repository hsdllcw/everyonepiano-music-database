### More Hearts Than Mine歌词：

I can't wait to show you where I grew up  
Walk you around the foothills of my town  
Probably feel like you've been there before  
After hearing all the stories I've been telling you  
For six months now  
We'll probably have to sleep in separate bedrooms  
Pack a shirt for church because we'll go  
I'm not trying to scare you off but  
I just thought that we should talk a few things out  
Before we hit the road  
If I bring you home to mama  
I guess I'd better warn ya  
She falls in love a little faster than I do  
And my dad will check your tyres  
Pour you whiskey over ice and  
Take you fishing but pretend that he don't like you  
If we break up  
I'll be fine  
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine  
My sister's gonna ask a million questions  
Say anything she can to turn you red  
And when you meet my high school friends  
They'll buy you drinks and fill you in  
On all the crazy nights I can't outlive  
So if I bring you home to mama  
I guess I'd better warn ya  
She falls in love a little faster than I do  
And my dad will check your tyres  
Pour you whiskey over ice and  
Buy you dinner but pretend that he don't like you  
If we break up  
I'll be fine  
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine  
If I bring you home to mama  
I guess I'd better warn ya  
She feels every heartache I go through  
And if my dad sees me crying  
He'll pour some whiskey over ice and  
Tell a lie and say he never really liked you  
If we break up  
I'll be fine  
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine  
You'll be breaking more hearts than mine
