### That's What I Like歌词：

I got a condo in Manhattan  
Baby girl what's hatnin'  
You and your ass invited  
So gon' and get to clappin'  
So pop it for a pimp  
Pop pop it for me  
Turn around and drop it for a pimp  
Drop drop it for me  
I'll rent a beach house in Miami  
Wake up with no jammies  
Lobster tail for dinner  
Julio serve that scampi  
You got it if you want it  
Got got it if you want it  
Said you got it if you want it  
Take my wallet if you want it now  
Jump in the Cadillac girl let's put some miles on it  
Anything you want just to put a smile on it  
You deserve it baby you deserve it all  
And I'm gonna give it to you  
Gold jewelry shining so bright  
Strawberry champagne on ice  
Lucky for you that's what I like that's what I like  
Lucky for you that's what I like that's what I like  
Sex by the fire at night  
Silk sheets and diamonds all white  
Lucky for you that's what I like that's what I like  
Lucky for you that's what I like that's what I like  
I'm talkin' trips to Puerto Rico  
Say the word and we go  
You can be my freaka  
Girl I'll be a fleeko mamacita  
I will never make a promise that I can't keep  
I promise that you'll smile and gon' never leave  
Shopping sprees in Paris  
Everything 24 karat  
Take a look in that mirror  
Now tell me who's the fairest  
Is it you is it you is it me is it me  
Say it's us say it's us and I'll agree baby  
Jump in the Cadillac girl let's put some miles on it  
Anything you want just to put a smile on it  
You deserve it baby you deserve it all  
And I'm gonna give it to you  
Gold jewelry shining so bright  
Strawberry champagne on ice  
Lucky for you that's what I like that's what I like  
Lucky for you that's what I like that's what I like  
Sex by the fire at night  
Silk sheets and diamonds all white  
Lucky for you that's what I like that's what I like  
Lucky for you that's what I like that's what I like  
If you say you want a good time  
Well here I am baby here I am baby  
Talk to me talk to me talk to me  
Tell me what's on your mind  
If you want it girl come and get it  
All this is here for you  
Tell me baby tell me tell me baby  
What you tryna do  
Gold jewelry shining so bright  
Strawberry champagne on ice  
Lucky for you that's what I like that's what I like  
Lucky for you that's what I like that's what I like  
Sex by the fire at night  
Silk sheets and diamonds all white  
Lucky for you that's what I like that's what I like  
Lucky for you that's what I like that's what I like
