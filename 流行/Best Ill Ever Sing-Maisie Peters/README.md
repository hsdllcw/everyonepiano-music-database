### Best I'll Ever Sing歌词：

Maybe I'm better off  
A little taller now you're gone  
Writing words and they don't sting  
But they don't mean half as much without you listening  
The crying at the piano  
You're like stood in the shadows  
When I try to soften my words  
Maybe we brought out the worst in each other  
A million full stops on our skin  
But baby the songs that I wrote as your other  
Are the best I'll ever sing  
'Cause they all go ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Like there was a choir in every line back then  
'Cause they all go ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
And that was the best I'll ever sing  
I don't see you at my shows  
'Cause if you heard this it would cut too close  
Wish I could stop writing us God knows I've tried  
Every moment immortalized  
Crying at the piano  
You're like stood in the shadows  
When I try to soften my words  
Oh maybe we brought out the worst in each other  
A million full stops on our skin  
But baby the songs that I wrote as your other  
Are the best I'll ever sing  
'Cause they were like ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Like there was a choir in every line back then  
They all go ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
And that was the best I'll ever sing  
And when the curtain falls I'll bury you again  
Every lyric is a letter that I'll never send  
A piece of me from when  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
There was a choir in every line back then  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
And that was the best I'll ever sing  
Maybe we brought out the worst in each other  
A million full stops on our skin  
But baby the songs that I wrote as your other  
They're the best I'll ever sing
