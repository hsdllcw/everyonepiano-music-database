### Just Another Day歌词：

Yeah man play that New York drum Homer  
Show 'em how we do it  
Downtown  
Just another way to prove I love you  
And it's hard today  
I'll lay back in my chair and find a way  
And when you say that thing that you say  
That makes me mad  
I'll turn away I'll turn away I'll turn away  
And think of different ways to keep my spirits up  
And choreograph hours with playful joyous thoughts  
We both know I could learn a thing or two  
About relaxing hey I love you  
And after all it's just another day  
Oh I could use some two or three  
Or other kind of ways to be  
But today I won't be so hard on me  
I'll walk alone down a different street  
And smile at all the new strange I meet  
And pick up unique style  
I'll kick around today  
And create simple thoughts  
I'll laugh in humble ways  
We both know I could learn a thing or two  
About behaving but I love you  
And after all it's just another day  
Come on Mark  
Ladies and gentlemen Brian Newman  
We both know I could learn a thing or two  
About behaving but I love you  
And after all it's just another day  
And after all  
And after all  
It's just another day
