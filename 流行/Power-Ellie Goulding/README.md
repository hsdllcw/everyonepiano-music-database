### Power歌词：

Painted to pure perfection  
We had a real connection  
Bodies aching overtaken  
You kept me at a distance  
Not asking any questions  
Fingers Pressing  
Learning lessons  
Beautiful lies on a Friday night  
Starting to wonder where we lost the magic  
Head in the clouds talking so loud all I hear is static  
I'm not a material girl everything in your world just feels like plastic  
Wearing your crown it's pulling me down  
You just want the power you're not really down for love  
You just want the power  
The power  
No I'm not chasing paper and I'm not faking neither  
Take me higher or this will expire  
Your self obsessions boring sorry if I'm ignoring  
Mindless actions lead to destruction  
Beautiful lies on a Friday night  
Starting to wonder where we lost the magic  
Head in the clouds talking so loud all I hear is static  
I'm not a material girl everything in your world just feels like plastic  
Wearing your crown it's pulling me down  
You just want the power you're not really down for love  
You just want the power  
The power  
Everything you do is so cruel  
Taking me for a fool  
Making me need a new fix  
Making me worship you  
Everything you do is so cruel  
Taking me for a fool  
Making me need a new fix  
Making me worship you  
Beautiful lies on a Friday night  
Starting to wonder where we lost the magic  
Head in the clouds talking so loud all I hear is static  
I'm not a material girl everything in your world just feels like plastic  
Wearing your crown it's pulling me down  
You just want the power you're not really down for love  
You just want the power  
The power
