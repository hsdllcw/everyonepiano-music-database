### Smoke Gets in Your Eyes歌词：

They asked me how I knew my true love was true,  
I of course replied, something here inside cannot be denied.  
They said someday you'll find all who love are blind,  
When your heart's on fire, you must realize,  
Smoke gets in your eyes.  
So I chaffed and then I gaily laughed,  
To think that they could doubt my love,  
Yet today, my love has flown away,  
I am without my love.  
Now laughing friends deride tears I cannot hide,  
So I smile and say when a lovely flame dies,  
Smoke gets in your eyes
