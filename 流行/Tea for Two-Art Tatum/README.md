**Tea for Two** 是美国爵士乐钢琴家和大师Art Tatum的翻唱曲子。Art
Tatum被公认为是有史以来最伟大的爵士乐钢琴家之一，并深深影响着后代的爵士钢琴家。他以熟稔精湛的技巧著名，并为爵士钢琴技巧设立新的标竿。评论家斯科特•耶诺（Scott
Yanow）认为：“Tatum的快速反应力和无限的想象力使他能保持他不断产生新鲜（有时是未来）的想法，使他超过同时代的竞争者…阿特•泰特姆的录音至今仍然可以吓唬现代钢琴家。”

  
最初， _Tea for Two_ 是一首20世纪20年代流行于百老汇的爵士乐曲。作曲者是Vincent Youmans，作词者是Irving
Caesar。这是1925年音乐剧《NO，NO，NANETTE》其中的一首歌曲。这首歌是以一位幻想中的男子为观点，他正计划与他幻想中的女人共渡未来。

### Tea for Two歌词：

I'm discontented with homes that are rented so I have invented my own.  
Darling this place is a lover's oasis where life's weary chase is unknown.  
Far from the cry of the city, where flowers pretty caress the streams,  
Cozy to hide in, to love side-by-side in. Don't let it abide in my dreams.

Picture you upon my knee, just tea for two and two for tea,  
Just me for you and you for me, alone!  
Nobody near us, to see us or hear us,  
No friends or relations on weekend vacations,  
We won't have it known, dear, that we have a telephone, dear.  
Day will break and you'll awake and start to bake  
A sugar cake for me to take for all the boys to see.  
We will raise a family, a boy for you, a girl for me,  
Oh, can't you see how happy life would be?

You are revealing a plan so appealing I can't help but falling for you,  
Darling, I planned it; can't you understand it is yours to command it, so do.  
All of your schemes I'm admiring, they're worth desiring but can't you see,  
I'd like to wait there for some future date dear;  
it won't be too late, dear, for me.

Picture you upon my knee, just tea for two and two for tea,  
Just me for you and you for me, alone!  
Nobody near us, to see us or hear us,  
No friends or relations on weekend vacations,  
We won't have it known, dear, that we have a telephone, dear.  
Day will break and you'll awake and start to bake  
A sugar cake for me to take for all the boys to see.  
We will raise a family, a boy for you, a girl for me,  
Oh, can't you see how happy life would be?
