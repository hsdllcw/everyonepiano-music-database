Rocket Man歌词：

She packed my bags last night pre flight  
Zero hour nine a.m.  
And I'm gonna be high, as a kite by then  
I miss the earth so much, I miss my wife  
It's lonely out in space  
On such a timeless flight  
And I think it's gonna be a long long time  
Till touch down brings me round again to find  
I'm not the man they think I am at home  
Oh no, no, no, I'm a rocket man  
Rocket man burning out his fuse up here alone  
And I think it's gonna be a long long time  
Till touch down brings me round again to find  
I'm not the man they think I am at home  
Oh no, no, no, I'm a rocket man  
Rocket man burning out his fuse up here alone  
Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids  
In fact it's cold as Hell  
And there's no one there to raise them if you didn't  
And all this science, I don't understand  
It's just my job, five days a week  
A rocket man, a rocket man  
And I think it's gonna be a long long time  
Till touch down brings me round again to find  
I'm not the man they think I am at home  
Oh no, no, no, I'm a rocket man  
Rocket man burning out his fuse up here alone  
And I think it's gonna be a long long time  
Till touch down brings me round again to find  
I'm not the man they think I am at home  
Oh no, no, no, I'm a rocket man  
Rocket man burning out his fuse up here alone  
Now, I think it's gonna be a long long time  
And I think it's gonna be a long long time  
And I think it's gonna be a long long time  
And I think it's gonna be a long long time
