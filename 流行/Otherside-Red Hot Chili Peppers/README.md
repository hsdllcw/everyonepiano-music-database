**Otherside** 是Red Hot Chili
Peppers乐团的作品，收录在其专辑Californication中。CALIFORNICATION的最大意义与乐迷最引颈以待的因素，是JOHN跟乐队做出复合让CHILI
PEPPERS这个最经典的阵容重视。然而CALIFORMICATION并不是扮演着BLOOD SUGAR SEX
MAGIK在多年后的延续篇。相隔了八个年头，在近作里我们听到的是乐队迈向成熟细腻的歌曲创作，构成一张CHILI PEPPERS最旋律化的著作。

### Otherside歌词：

[Chorus:]  
How long how long will I slide  
Separate my side I don't  
I don't believe it's bad  
Slit my throat  
It's all I ever

I heard your voice through a photograph  
I thought it up it brought up the past  
Once you know you can never go back  
I've got to take it on the otherside

Centuries are what it meant to me  
A cemetery where I marry the sea  
Stranger things could never change my mind  
I've got to take it on the otherside  
Take it on the otherside  
Take it on  
Take it on

[Chorus]

Pour my life into a paper cup  
The ashtray's full and I'm spillin' my guts  
She wants to know am I still a slut  
I've got to take it on the otherside

Scarlet starlet and she's in my bed  
A candidate for my soul mate bled  
Push the trigger and pull the thread  
I've got to take it on the otherside  
Take it on the otherside  
Take it on  
Take it on

[Chorus]

Turn me on take me for a hard ride  
Burn me out leave me on the otherside  
I yell and tell it that  
It's not my friend  
I tear it down I tear it down  
And then it's born again

[Chorus]

How long I don't believe it's bad  
Slit my throat  
It's all I ever
