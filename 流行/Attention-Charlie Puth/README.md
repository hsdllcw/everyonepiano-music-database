### Attention歌词：

Whoa oh oh hm  
You've been runnin' round, runnin' round, runnin' round throwin' that dirt all
on my name  
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd call you up  
You've been going round, going round, going round every party in LA  
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd be at one  
I know that dress is karma, perfume regret  
You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine  
And now I'm all up on ya, what you expect  
But you're not coming home with me tonight  
You just want attention  
You don't want my heart  
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new  
Yeah, you just want attention  
I knew from the start  
You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you  
You've been runnin' round, runnin' round, runnin' round throwing that dirt all
on my name  
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd call you up  
Baby, now that we're, now that we're, now that we're right here standing face
to face  
You already know, already know, already know that you won  
Ohh  
I know that dress is karma (dress is karma), perfume regret  
You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine  
(You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine)  
And now I'm all up on ya (all up on ya), what you expect  
(Oh baby)  
But you're not coming home with me tonight (oh no)  
You just want attention  
You don't want my heart  
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new  
Yeah, you just want attention (ohh)  
I knew from the start (start)  
You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you (oh you)  
Ohh  
What are you doin' to me?  
What are you doin', love? (What are you doin'?)  
What are you doin' to me?  
What are you doin', love? (What are you doin'?)  
What are you doin' to me?  
What are you doin', love? (What are you doin'?)  
What are you doin' to me?  
What are you doin', love?  
I know that dress is karma, perfume regret  
You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine  
And now I'm all up on ya, what you expect  
But you're not coming home with me tonight  
You just want attention  
You don't want my heart  
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new  
Yeah, you just want attention  
I knew from the start  
You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you
