### Modus歌词：

Speed it up  
Slow it down  
I need control  
I need it now  
I need to live  
A thousand times  
I cannot stop  
I cannot cry  
I will not fret  
I will not die  
I am machine  
I stay alive  
Sometimes I think  
Sometimes I think  
Sometimes I think  
Sometimes I ooh  
I've got no aim  
A million rounds  
Is nothing real  
A hundred pounds  
Of heavy steel  
It feels so loud  
Tied to my chest  
It feels so loud  
I'll take a peek  
To across the peaks  
This grass is neat  
I'm quite unique  
But I'd like to be  
But I'd like to be  
And I hope this is the hardest part we try we try  
And when they say they're satisfied they're lying they're lying  
Do forgive me I've seen the treasure's in the bloom  
But right now I'm just not strong enough for you  
Sorry you can see it in my retina  
Focus in and out I'm doing bet-ter  
Artificial ghost with no perception  
I wanna be a Chevy not a Sentra  
I don't feel the way they programmed me to feel today  
Some pieces falling from the waist up  
I'm so sorry for delays  
I just need one moment to erase  
That burning pain before the rage  
I feel good I feel good I feel good I FIXED IT  
And I hope this is the hardest part we try we try  
And when they say they're satisfied they're lying their life  
Do forgive me I've seen the treasure's in the bloom  
But right now I'm just not strong enough for you  
And I hope this is the hardest part we try we try  
And when they say they're satisfied they're lying they're lying  
Do forgive me I've seen the treasure's in the bloom  
But right now I'm just not strong enough for you
