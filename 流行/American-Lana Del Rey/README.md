《 **American** 》(美国佬)为Lana Del Rey2012年末发表的改版EP《Born to Die – The Paradise
Edition（难逃一死–天堂版）》的第二首曲目,接《Ride》下承《Cola》。

  

在Lana Del Rey的以往作品中，好莱坞排场的弦乐混搭Hip-
Hop鼓点的编排屡见不鲜，加上千变万化的声音形象和可以放大的混响，她总能给人以“不食人间烟火”的错觉。但在这首单曲中电影配乐的比重有所增大，其他戏码则相对有所锐减。其前奏很容易让人想起电影《2012》结尾处诺亚方舟舱门打开后人们目睹日出的惆怅，仔细留意歌词，人们又仿佛看见一个个身穿T恤、牛仔裤和帆布鞋的美国佬在Party里边嗑药边乱舞的场面。

American歌词：

  
Play house, put my favorite record on  
Get down, get your Crystal Method on  
You were like, tall, tan, drivin' 'round the city  
Flirtin' with the girls like, You're so pretty.  
Springsteen is the king, don't you think?  
I was like, Hell yeah, that guy can sing.  
Like ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh  
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-oh  
You make me crazy, you make me wild  
Just like a baby, spin me 'round like a child  
Your skin so golden brown  
Be young, be dope, be proud  
Like an American  
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh-ooh  
Like an American  
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh-ooh  
Drive fast, I can almost taste it now  
L.A., I don't even have to fake it now  
You were like so sick, everybody said it  
You were way ahead of the trend, ge-get it  
Elvis is the best, hell yes  
Honey, put on that party dress  
Like ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh  
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-oh  
You make me crazy, you make me wild  
Just like a baby, spin me 'round like a child  
Your skin so golden brown  
Be young, be dope, be proud  
Like an American  
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh-ooh  
Like an American  
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh-ooh  
Everybody wants to go fast  
But they can't compare  
I don't really want the rest  
Only you can take me there  
I don't even know what I'm saying,  
But I'm praying for you.  
You make me crazy, you make me wild  
Just like a baby, spin me 'round like a child  
Your skin so golden brown  
Be young, be dope, be proud  
Like an American  
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh-ooh  
Like an American  
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh-ooh  
Like an American  
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh-ooh  
Like an American  
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh-ooh
