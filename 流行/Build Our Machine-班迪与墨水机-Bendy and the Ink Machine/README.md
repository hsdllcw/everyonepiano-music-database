### Build Our Machine歌词：

They have sent you a letter  
To come back home to play  
To your dismay  
This isn't your day  
For the happy fun time has begun to fade  
Watch as we reanimate our corpses you abandoned  
And we're dismantled we're mishandled  
But we won't be skipped and swayed  
Trapped within these walls  
You left our souls to drip away  
The ink decays  
The walls at bay  
But the reckoning has come today  
You say  
Boris has no guts 'cause you replaced it with mechanical strain  
We've been tortured  
But we move forward  
This disorder kills your day  
I am alive  
Immortalized  
You're the creator  
You traitor  
Hey  
There's no vaccine  
To cure our dirty needs  
For now you must  
Build up our machine  
You die tonight  
Tonight  
Build up our machine  
You die tonight  
Tonight  
Build up our machine  
You die tonight night night  
So you found all the pieces  
To initiate the pain  
Our venom stains  
The night remains  
But the ending is always just the same  
No gain  
Nod your head to the beat of death  
As you draw your last eternal breath  
Sensations  
Of an invasion  
Start to course right through your veins  
You say we have no brains  
We're just cartoons for your portrayal  
To tell some tale about a boat and sail  
But sure this inevitably unveils the fail  
Splashes of eternal hate  
Will flood the floor and clean your slate  
Now we're the tools  
And you're the fool  
Our nightmare dominates  
I am alive  
Immortalized  
You're the creator  
You traitor  
Hey  
There's no vaccine  
To cure our dirty needs  
For now you must  
Build up our machine  
You die tonight  
I am alive  
Immortalized  
You're the creator  
You traitor  
Hey  
There's no vaccine  
To cure our dirty needs  
For now you must  
Build up our machine  
You die tonight  
Tonight  
Build up our machine  
You die tonight  
Tonight  
Build up our machine  
You die tonight  
I am aware  
That your soul is now divine  
We care not to toil with unbroken chains  
So don't toil with ours  
Like he did to our shining stars shining stars  
So prepare for adventure  
We're a whole new creature from the darkest side  
You can't take away the pain we feel  
Created as monsters that come to life  
Come back to life  
So you've come to the end now  
Alive but dead inside  
The heart beats loud  
You've joined the crowd  
We are but punished serpentines  
Your life with him was fun  
But now the terror's only just begun  
Now come with me  
And you will see  
Were a new born cyanid  
I am alive  
Immortalized  
You're the creator  
You traitor  
Hey  
There's no vaccine  
To cure our dirty needs  
For now you must  
Build up our machine  
You die tonight  
I am alive  
Immortalized  
You're the creator  
You traitor  
Hey  
There's no vaccine  
To cure our dirty needs  
For now you must  
Build up our machine  
You die tonight  
Tonight  
Build up our machine  
You die tonight  
Tonight  
Build up our machine  
You die tonight tonight tonight tonight tonight
