**One More Light双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_One More Light_ 是Linkin Park于2017年发行的专辑《One More Light》中的第九首歌，是专辑的同名歌曲。Linkin
Park新世代的音乐顽童，无门无派，嬉笑怒骂游走于各门各派之间，博采众家之长，是这个时代独一无二的混种音乐霸王。Linkin
Park认为“混合理论”就是乐队努力的目标，乐风融入另类摇滚、嘻哈节奏、炫丽的电子乐等元素，成为了摇滚乐E世代的精神堡垒。他们在世界范围内不仅引发着混合音乐风暴，也激励着不甘人后的年青人们发现自身力量。在他们的身后，是年青人自由、博大、包容的精神世界。

### One More Light歌词：

Should've stayed  
Were there signs I ignored  
Can I help you not to hurt anymore  
We saw brilliance when the world was asleep  
There are things that we can have  
But can't keep  
If they say  
Who cares if one more light goes out  
In the sky of a million stars  
It flickers flickers  
Who cares when someone's time runs out  
If a moment is all we are  
Or quicker quicker  
Who cares if one more light goes out  
Well I do  
The reminders pull the floor from your feet  
In the kitchen one more chair than you need  
Oh and you're angry  
And you should be  
It's not fair  
Just 'cause you can't see it  
Doesn't mean it isn't there  
If they say  
Who cares if one more light goes out  
In the sky of a million stars  
It flickers flickers  
Who cares when someone's time runs out  
If a moment is all we are  
Or quicker quicker  
Who cares if one more light goes out  
Well I do  
Who cares if one more light goes out  
In the sky of a million stars  
It flickers flickers  
Who cares when someone's time runs out  
If a moment is all we are  
Or quicker quicker  
Who cares if one more light goes out  
Well I do  
Well I do
