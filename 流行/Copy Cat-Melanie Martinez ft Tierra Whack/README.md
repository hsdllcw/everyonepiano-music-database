### Copy Cat歌词：

Melanie Martinez：  
Over my shoulder eyes peeking in  
Analyze my every move  
What current state I'm in  
'Cause you are colder than ice on my skin  
Wanna get that A+ baby  
So you take my s**t  
'Cause I am little right  
I won't call you out  
Teachers saying you'd get credit  
Why would you stop now  
You are so desperate craving that spotlight  
Shining on the ones who do that s**t 'cause it's their life  
But I know the people around you say  
"Just do what it takes to make it all the way"  
You're the copy cat  
You take it then you leave it  
Honey just like that  
Just like that  
You're falling flat  
You find someone like me to bring you up right back  
Up right back  
Copy cat copy cat  
Obsessed with power  
You want it for yourself  
Feeding on misogyny  
But still you call yourself a feminista  
If that were really true  
You wouldn't feel  
As if I were a current threat to you  
But I know the people around you say  
"Just do what it takes to make it all the way"  
You're the copy cat  
You take it then you leave it  
Honey just like that just like that  
You're falling flat  
You find someone like me to bring you up right back  
Up right back  
Copy cat copy cat  
Find someone else to leech on lady  
My blood's for me not for you baby  
College estate and all your savings  
My blood's for me so no more taking  
Tierra Whack：  
Anything you can do  
I can do better  
In prison for stealing gon' write you a letter  
Courageous and clever  
Creative director  
I raised the bar high  
Yes sir I broke the record  
I'm hot as peppers  
My words are in leather  
Scuffed up my boots boy I'll stomp you in Skechers  
They wanna build like their first name is Hector  
Back against wall b***h I am a projector  
From the projects  
Don't check on my ex  
Think you're the boss then I'll break broken necks  
Wish you the best  
Won't show you my next move  
So I guess you'll be upset  
Don't cry no baby  
You'll find your own way  
Think for yourself  
It'll all be okay  
Copyright lyrics  
You can't steal my spirit  
They live for my music  
They're dying to hear it  
Imitated never duplicated  
You wish you related  
You wish you'd have made it  
Imitated never duplicated  
You wish you related  
You wish you'd have made it  
Melanie Martinez：  
You're the copy cat  
You take it then you leave it  
Honey just like that just like that  
You're falling flat  
You find someone like me to bring you up right back  
Up right back  
Copy cat copy cat
