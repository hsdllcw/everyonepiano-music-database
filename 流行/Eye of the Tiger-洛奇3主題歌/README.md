《 **Eye of the Tiger** 》是电影《洛奇3》（Rocky III）主题曲。由Survivor演唱。

  

西尔维斯特·史泰龙再任导演拍摄《洛奇》第三集，竟然为这个传奇性的英雄角色开拓了新的戏剧空间，主题亦有新的突破，成绩相当亮眼。在本片中，洛基已连任数届拳王，名成利就之下安于逸乐生活而丧失斗志。黑人拳师T先生在大庭广众下公开向洛基叫阵，并且真的在擂台上打败了洛基，老教练因而病发去世。在洛基陷入低潮时，昔日死对头阿波罗毛遂自荐担任洛基的教练，重新激发他的斗志，终于在重赛时赢回了拳王宝座。在探讨名人高处不胜寒的心境方面，效果出奇的深刻和富于自省，故事的发展也跌宕有致。T先生原为重量级拳王阿里的保镖，造型和演出均具有爆炸性。

  

Survivor所演唱的《洛基第三集(Rocky III)》血脉喷张电影主题曲Eye of the
Tiger，此作蝉联了全美单曲榜6周冠军，并一举拿下了Grammy最佳摇滚团体演唱奖，1992年奥斯卡最佳电影歌曲奖，将Survivor
的全球声势推向了高峰！

Eye of the Tiger歌词：

  
Risin' up  
back on the street  
did my time took my chances  
went the distance  
now i'm back on my feet  
just a man and and his will to survive  
so many times  
it happens too fast  
you trade your passion for glory  
don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past  
you must fight just to keep them alive  
Chorus  
It's the eye of the tiger  
It's the eye of the tiger  
It's the eye of the tiger  
it's the thrill of the fight  
it's the thrill of the fight  
it's the thrill of the fight  
risin' up to the challenge of our rival  
risin' up to the challenge of our rival  
risin' up to the challenge of our rival  
and the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night  
and the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night  
and the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night  
and he's watchin us all with the eye  
and he's watchin us all with the eye  
and he's watchin us all with the eye  
of the tiger  
of the tiger  
of the tiger  
Face to face  
out in the heat  
hangin' tough  
stayin' hungry  
they stack the odds  
still we take to the street  
for the kill with the will to survive  
Risin' up  
straight to the top  
had the guts  
got the glory  
went the distance  
now i'm not gonna stop  
just a man and his will to survive
