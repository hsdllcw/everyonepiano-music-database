_Sweetest Devotion_
是英国歌手Adele所演唱的一首歌曲，收录在其第三张录音室专辑《25》中，是此专辑的第11首歌曲。在一个缺乏超级巨星的时代，Adele以唱功、歌曲、演唱等几大纯音乐的元素而赢得听众。尤其是将个人的情绪，唱出一种大歌的效果，而这种雅俗共赏的大气，恰恰是这个崇尚个性却缺乏共性的时代最为缺少的音乐气质。另一方面，Adele虽然年轻，但她主打的并不是年轻人的市场。这张被寄予厚望的专辑，也在美国市场以570万张的首周销量，创造了一项新的音乐纪录。

### Sweetest Devotion歌词：

With your loving  
There ain't nothing  
That I can't adore  
The way I'm running with you honey  
Means we can break every law  
I find it funny that you're the only  
One I never looked for  
There is something in your loving  
That tears down my walls

I weren't ready then  
I'm ready now  
I'm heading straight for you  
You will only be eternally  
The one that I belong to

The sweetest devotion  
Hit me like an explosion  
All of my life I've been frozen  
The sweetest devotion I know

I'll forever be whatever  
You want me to be  
I'd go under and all over  
For your clarity  
When you wonder  
If I'm gonna lose my way home just remember  
That come whatever I'll be yours all along

I weren't ready then  
I'm ready now  
I'm heading straight for you  
You will only be eternally  
The one that I belong to

The sweetest devotion  
Hit me like an explosion  
All of my life I've been frozen  
The sweetest devotion I know

I've been looking for you baby  
In every face that I've ever known  
And there is something about the way you love me  
That finally feels like home  
You're my light you're my darkness  
You're the right kind of madness  
You're my hope you're my despair  
You're my scope of everything everywhere

[x2]  
The sweetest devotion  
Hit me like an explosion  
All of my life I've been frozen  
The sweetest devotion I know

[x4:]  
The sweetest  
It's the sweetest

Devotion
