### Battle Scars歌词：

Intro: Lupe Fiasco  
The wound heals but it never does  
That's cause you're at war with love  
You're at war with love, yeah

Hook: Guy Sebastian  
These battle scars, don't look like they're fading  
Don't look like they're ever going away  
They ain't never gonna change  
This battle

Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco  
Never let a wound ruin me  
But I feel like ruin's wooing me  
Arrow holes, they never close from cupid on a shooting spree  
Feeling stupid cause I know it ain't no you and me  
But when you're trying to beat the odds up  
Been trying to keep your nods up  
And you know that you should know  
And let her go  
But the fear of the unknown  
Holding another lover strong  
Sends you back into the zone  
With no Tom Hanks to bring you home  
Another night of fighting  
On the frontline with a poem  
Trying to write yourself a rifle  
Maybe sharpen up a stone  
To fight the tanks and drones of you being alone

Pre-hook: Guy Sebastian  
I wish I never looked, I wish I never touched  
I wish that I could stop loving you so much  
Cause I'm the only one that's trying to keep us together  
When all of the signs say that I should forget her  
I wish you weren't the best, the best I ever had  
I wish that the good outweighed the bad  
Cause it'll never be over, until you tell me it's over

Hook: Guy Sebastian  
These battle scars, don't look like they're fading  
Don't look like they're ever going away  
They ain't never gonna change  
These battle scars, don't look like they're fading  
Don't look like they're ever going away  
They ain't never gonna change  
These battle...

Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco  
(Just leave)  
You shouldn't have but you said it  
(And I hope you never come back)  
It shouldn't have happened but you let it  
Now you're down on the ground screaming medic  
The only thing that comes is the post-traumatic stresses  
Shields, body armors and vests don't properly work  
That's why you're in a locker full of hurt  
The enemy within and all the fires from your friends  
The best medicine is to probably just let her win

Pre-hook: Guy Sebastian  
I wish I couldn't feel, I wish I couldn't love  
I wish that I could stop cause it hurts so much  
And I'm the only one that's trying to keep us together  
When all of the signs say that I should forget her  
I wish you weren't the best, the best I ever had  
I wish that the good outweighed the bad  
Cause it'll never be over, until you tell me it's over

Hook: Guy Sebastian  
These battle scars, don't look like they're fading  
Don't look like they're ever going away  
They ain't never gonna change  
These battle scars, don't look like they're fading  
Don't look like they're ever going away  
They ain't never gonna change  
These battle...

Bridge: Guy Sebastian & Lupe Fiasco  
Cause you've set me on fire  
I've never felt so alive, yeah

Hoping wounds heal, but it never does  
That's because you're at war with love

And I'm at the point of breaking  
And it's impossible to shake it

See, you hoped the wound heals, but it never does  
That's cause you're at war with love  
Hope it heals, but it never does  
That's cause you're at war with love!

Hook: Guy Sebastian  
These battle scars, don't look like they're fading  
Don't look like they're ever going away  
They ain't never gonna change  
These battle scars, don't look like they're fading  
Don't look like they're ever going away  
They ain't never gonna change  
These battle scars, don't look like they're fading  
Don't look like they're ever going away  
They ain't never gonna change  
These battle
