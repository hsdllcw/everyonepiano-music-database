_July_ 是美国女歌手Noah Cyrus于2019年发行的单曲。Noah
Cyrus的嗓音是这首歌最好的诠释，明明是为爱所伤而离去，但她却能唱出一种释然淡然的感觉，这种感觉让人痴迷，沉浸在她的歌声里。看她在阳光洒满的小路上漫无目的的行走，抛弃了行李，独然一身，不由得产生自由洒脱的想法。慢慢流淌的吉他声，不看歌词的话，还会给人悠闲的感觉，根本想不到是黯然神伤的情歌。

### July歌词：

I've been holding my breath  
I've been counting to ten  
Over something you said  
I've been holding back tears  
While you're throwing back beers  
I'm alone in bed  
You know I  
I'm afraid of change  
Guess that's why we stay the same  
So tell me to leave  
I'll pack my bags  
Get on the road  
Find someone that loves you  
Better than I do darling I know  
'Cause you remind me every day  
I'm not enough but I still stay  
Feels like a lifetime  
Just trying to get by while we're dying inside  
I've done a lot of things wrong  
Loving you being one  
But I can't move on  
You know I  
I'm afraid of change  
Guess that's why we stay the same  
So tell me to leave  
I'll pack my bags  
Get on the road  
Find someone that loves you  
Better than I do darling I know  
'Cause you remind me every day  
I'm not enough but I still stay  
If you want me to leave  
Then tell me to leave and baby I'll go  
You remind me every day  
I'm not enough but I still stay
