**Mad Woman** 是由美国女歌手Taylor
Swift录唱的一首歌曲，被收录在Taylor于2020年7月24日发行的第八张录音室专辑《Folklore》，为其所属专辑中的第12首歌曲。

如果说Look What You Made Me Do 是对曾伤害过Taylor的人的无差别扫射，那么 _Mad Woman_
就应该是对侃爷和卡戴珊的定向狙击。舒缓平静的配乐，愤怒怨恨的歌词，真的有点钝刀子割肉那味了，歌词诉说的是Taylor被陷害的整个心理变化过程。

### Mad Woman歌词：

What did you think I'd say to that  
Does a scorpion sting when fighting back  
They strike to kill  
And you know I will  
You know I will  
What do you sing on your drive home  
Do you see my face in the neighbor's lawn  
Does she smile  
Or does she mouth f**k you forever  
Every time you call me crazy  
I get more crazy  
What about that  
And when you say I seem angry  
I get more angry  
And there's nothing like a mad woman  
What a shame she went mad  
No one likes a mad woman  
You made her like that  
And you'll poke that bear til her claws come out and you find something  
to wrap your noose around  
And there's nothing like a mad woman  
Now I breathe flames each time I talk  
My cannons all firing at your yacht  
They say move on  
But you know I won't  
And women like hunting witches too  
Doing your dirtiest work for you  
It's obvious that wanting me dead has really brought you two together  
Every time you call me crazy  
I get more crazy  
What about that  
And when you say I seem angry  
I get more angry  
And there's nothing like a mad woman  
What a shame she went mad  
No one likes a mad woman  
You made her like that  
And you'll poke that bear til her claws come out and you find something  
to wrap your noose around  
And there's nothing like a mad woman  
I'm taking my time  
Taking my time  
Cause you took everything from me  
Watching you climb  
Watching you climb  
Over people like me  
The master of spin  
Has a couple side flings  
Good wives always know  
She should be mad  
Should be scathing like me  
But no one likes a mad woman  
What a shame she went mad  
You made her like that
