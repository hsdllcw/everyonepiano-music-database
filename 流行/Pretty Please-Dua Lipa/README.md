**Pretty Please** 是由英国流行女歌手Dua Lipa录唱的一首歌曲，2020年发行，收录在Dua
Lipa发行的第二张录音室专辑《Future Nostalgia》，为专辑中的第6首歌曲。

该专辑将超未来电子声响结合怀旧复古迪斯科舞韵，打造舞动无休止的流行乐章，可谓是重新塑造了2020年代的迪斯科舞曲，既有怀旧感又不和时代脱节，而这张流行之作符合杜阿•利帕敢言胸臆的个人风格，该专辑涉及到了性别与种族不平等现象以及赋权，这些内容还伴随着一些引人随时起舞的迪斯科元素，其中的大部分歌曲都散发着强烈的乐观氛围。

### Pretty Please歌词：

Somewhere in the middle  
Think I lied a little  
I said if we took it there I wasn't gonna change  
But that went out the window  
Yeah  
I know that I seem a little stressed out  
But you're here now and you're turning me on  
I wanna feel a different kinda tension  
Yeah you guessed it the kind that's fun  
Hate it when you leave me unattended  
Cos I miss ya and I need your love  
When my mind is running wild could you help me slow it down  
Put my mind at ease  
Pretty please  
I need your hands on me  
Sweet relief  
Pretty please  
Exactly where I want me yeah  
Underneath your body yeah  
If we take it further I swear I ain't gonna break  
So baby come try me baby come find me baby don't wind me up  
I know that I seem a little stressed out  
But you're here now and you're turning me on  
I wanna feel a different kinda tension  
Yeah you guessed it the kind that's fun  
I hate it when you leave me unattended  
Cos I miss ya and I need your love  
When my mind is running wild could you help me slow it down  
Put my mind at ease  
Pretty please  
I need your hands on me  
Sweet relief  
Pretty  
Put my mind at ease  
Trickle down my spine oh you look so  
Pretty please  
Every single night  
I need your hands on me  
When your kisses climb oh you give me  
Sweet relief  
Make me feel so  
Pretty  
Would you help me out please  
Pretty  
Pretty  
Pretty  
Pretty  
I hate it when you leave me unattended  
Cos I miss ya and I need your love  
When my mind is running wild could you help me slow it down  
Put my mind at ease  
Trickle down my spine oh you look so  
Pretty please  
Every single night  
I need your hands on me  
When your kisses climb oh you give me  
Sweet relief  
Make me feel so  
Pretty  
Would you help me out please  
Pretty please
