### Drunk歌词：

I wanna be drunk when I wake up  
On the right side of the wrong bed  
And never an excuse I made up  
Tell you the truth I hate  
What didn't kill me,  
It never made me stronger at all  
Love will scar your make up  
Lips sticks to me, so now I maybe lean back there  
I'm sat here wishing I was sober  
I know I'll never hold you like I used to  
But a house gets cold when you cut the heating  
Without you to hold I'll be freezing  
Can't rely on my heart to beat in  
'Cause you take parts of it every evening  
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing  
Replace with phrases like 'when you leaving me? '  
Should I? Should I?  
Maybe I'll get drunk again  
I'll be drunk again, I'll be drunk again  
To feel a little love  
I wanna hold your heart in both hands  
Not watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can  
And I got no plans for the weekend, so should we speak then?  
Keep it between friends  
Though I know you'll never love me like you used to  
There maybe other people like us  
Who see the flicker of a clipper when they light up  
Flames just create us but burns don't heal like before  
And you don't hold me anymore  
On cold days cold plays out like the band's name  
I know I can't heal things with a handshake  
You know I can change, as I began saying  
You cut me wide open like landscape  
Open bottles of beer but never champagne  
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make  
Should I? Should I?  
Maybe I'll get drunk again  
I'll be drunk again, I'll be drunk again  
To feel a little love  
All by myself, I'm here again  
All by myself, you know I'll never change  
All by myself  
All by myself  
I'm just drunk again  
I'll be drunk again  
I'll be drunk again  
To feel a little love
