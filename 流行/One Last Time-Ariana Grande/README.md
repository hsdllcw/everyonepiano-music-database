### One Last Time歌词：

I was a liar  
I gave into the fire  
I know I should've fought it  
At least I'm being honest  
Feel like a failure  
'Cause I know that I failed you  
I should've done you better  
'Cause you don't want a liar (come on)

And I know, and I know, and I know  
She gives you everything but boy I couldn't give it to you  
And I know, and I know, and I know  
That you got everything  
But I got nothing here without you

So one last time  
I need to be the one who takes you home  
One more time  
I promise after that, I'll let you go  
Baby I don't care if you got hurt in your heart  
All I really care is you wake up in my arms  
One last time  
I need to be the one who takes you home

I don't deserve it  
I know I don't deserve it  
But stay with me a minute  
I'll swear I'll make it worth it  
Can't you forgive me  
At least just temporarily  
I know that this is my fault  
I should have been more careful (come on)

And I know, and I know, and I know  
She gives you everything but boy I couldn't give it to you  
And I know, and I know, and I know  
That you got everything  
But I got nothing here without you baby

So one last time  
I need to be the one who takes you home  
One more time  
I promise after that, I'll let you go  
Baby I don't care if you got hurt in your heart  
All I really care is you wake up in my arms  
One last time  
I need to be the one who takes you home

I know I shouldn't fight it  
At least I'm being honest  
Just stay with me a minute  
I swear I'll make it worth out  
'Cause I don't want to be without you

So one last time  
I need to be the one who takes you home  
One more time  
I promise after that, I'll let you go  
Baby I don't care if you got hurt in your heart  
All I really care is you wake up in my arms  
One last time  
I need to be the one who takes you home

One last time  
I need to be the one who takes you home
