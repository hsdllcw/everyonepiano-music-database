### Homesick歌词：

Dancin' in the kitchen  
You singing my favorite songs  
Swinging on the front porch  
Just laughing at the dogs  
Now you swear you love me more  
When you're whispering goodnight  
All those little moments are every reason why  
I'm homesick  
This feeling that I'm feeling  
No we don't quit  
It's like half of me is missing  
Heaven knows it that all I wanna do  
Is be alone with your brown eyes all tangled up  
Just holdin onto you tonight  
Until the morning  
Baby that's the d**n truth  
If home is where the heart is  
Then I'm homesick for you  
Well it says Kane Brown  
On a sign with a line out the door  
Sold out some little town  
I've never been before  
Yeah they're screaming my name  
This is what we dreamed about  
But out here singing about you baby all I thinking about  
Is how I'm homesick  
This feeling that I'm feeling  
No we don't quit  
It's like half of me is missing  
Heaven knows it that all I wanna do  
Is be alone with your brown eyes all tangled up  
Just holdin onto you tonight  
Until the morning  
Baby that's the d**n truth  
If home is where the heart is  
Then I'm homesick for you  
Homesick for you  
Yeah yeah  
I'm homesick  
This feeling that I'm feeling  
No we don't quit  
It's like half of me is missing  
Heaven knows it that all I wanna do  
Is be alone with your brown eyes just tangled up  
Just holdin' onto you tonight  
Until the morning  
Baby that's the d**n truth  
If home is where the heart is  
I'm homesick for you  
I'm homesick for you  
Yeah yeah
