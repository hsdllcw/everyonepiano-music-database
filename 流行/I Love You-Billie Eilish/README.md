### I Love You歌词：

It's not true  
Tell me I've been lied to  
Crying isn't like you  
Oh  
What the hell did I do  
Never been the type to  
Let someone see right through  
Oh  
Maybe won't you take it back  
Say you were tryna make me laugh  
And nothing has to change today  
You didn't mean to say I love you  
I love you and I don't want to  
Oh  
Up all night on another red eye  
I wish we never learned to fly  
I  
Maybe we should just try  
To tell ourselves a good lie  
I didn't mean to make you cry  
I  
Maybe won't you take it back  
Say you were tryna make me laugh  
And nothing has to change today  
You didn't mean to say I love you  
I love you and I don't want to  
Oh  
The smile that you gave me  
Even when you felt like dying  
We fall apart as it gets dark  
I'm in your arms in central park  
There's nothing you could do or say  
I can't escape the way I love you  
I don't want to but I love you  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh
