### Don't You Hold Me Down歌词：

Da da da da dam dam  
Don't you hold me down  
Da da da da dam dam  
Don't you hold me down  
I've been feelin' all the pressure  
I'd been lookin' for a sign mmm  
I don't love you any lesser  
I just need a little time  
I'm sorry but for real  
Don't wanna be tied up  
Don't wanna feel too much  
It's that's I wanna do I'm not done  
Da da da da dam dam  
Don't you hold me down  
Da da da da dam dam  
Don't you hold me down  
Da da da da dam dam  
Don't you hold me down  
Da da da da dam dam  
Don't you hold me down  
I've been waitin' for a lifetime  
I don't wanna miss a chance mmm  
All my visions go into like  
And you know I got bigger plans  
I'm sorry but for real  
Don't wanna be tied up  
Don't wanna feel too much  
It's that's I wanna do I'm not done  
Da da da da dam dam  
Don't you hold me down  
Da da da da dam dam  
Don't you hold me down  
Da da da da dam dam

Slow me slow me down
