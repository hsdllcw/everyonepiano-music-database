### Symphony歌词：

I’ve been hearing symphonies  
Before all I heard was silence  
A rhapsody for you and me  
And every melody is timeless  
Life was stringing me along  
Then you came and you cut me loose  
Was solo singing on my own  
Now I can’t find the key without you  
And now your song is on repeat  
And I’m dancin' on to your heartbeat  
And when you’re gone, I feel incomplete  
So if you want the truth  
I just wanna be part of your symphony  
Will you hold me tight and not let go?  
Symphony  
Like a love song on the radio  
Will you hold me tight and not let go?  
I’m sorry if it’s all too much  
Every day you’re here, I’m healing  
And I was runnin' out of luck  
I never thought I’d find this feeling  
'Cause I’ve been hearing symphonies  
Before all I heard was silence  
A rhapsody for you and me  
(A rhapsody for you and me)  
And every melody is timeless  
And now your song is on repeat  
And I’m dancin' on to your heartbeat  
And when you’re gone, I feel incomplete  
So if you want the truth  
I just wanna be part of your symphony  
Will you hold me tight and not let go?  
Symphony  
Like a love song on the radio  
Will you hold me tight and not let go?  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah  
Ah ah, ah  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah  
Ah ah, ah  
And now your song is on repeat  
And I’m dancin' on to your heartbeat  
And when you’re gone, I feel incomplete  
So if you want the truth  
(Oh, oh, oh)  
I just wanna be part of your symphony  
Will you hold me tight and not let go?  
Symphony  
Like a love song on the radio  
Symphony  
Will you hold me tight and not let go?  
Symphony  
Like a love song on the radio  
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
