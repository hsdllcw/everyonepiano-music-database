### Baby, I'm Jealous歌词：

Baby I'm jealous  
Jealous jealous jealous  
Jealous jealous jealous  
Hey  
Went from beautiful to ugly  
Cause insecurity told me you don't love me  
All it takes is a girl above me  
On your timeline to make me nothing  
This is me  
A woman in dichotomy  
I love me  
Until I don't  
Baby I'm jealous  
Of the pictures that you like  
Baby I'm jealous  
Of the girls with lighter eyes  
Baby I'm jealous  
And I know that it ain't right  
But I'm jealous jealous  
The jealous kind  
I'm jelly jelly jelly jelly jelly on a plate  
Sunnyside up I got egg on my face  
Waste trainer for a tinier waist  
But I can't help if I like the way food taste  
This is me  
A woman in dichotomy  
I love me  
Until I don't  
My apologies  
For looking at your history  
I'm trying to let it go  
Baby I'm jealous  
Of the pictures that you like  
Baby I'm jealous  
Of the girls with lighter eyes  
Baby I'm jealous  
And I know that it ain't right  
But I'm jealous jealous  
The jealous kind  
That chick can't be that chick  
Baby I'm a bad b***h  
If he feindin' he'll prolly get a catfish  
Keep him dreamin' to pull up on a nap s**t  
I don't even be askin' him who dat chick  
Uh huh who dat chick nah  
That's pitiful that's so average why  
Some women want men and some girls want bwahs  
Tell lies until they buggin' they pants on fire  
I stole ya man  
He got freedom to chase what he likes  
I know ya mad  
But he ain't even worth none of ya time  
It's such a drag  
I'm not being spiteful but he's trash  
Won't be the last  
To let you know but he gon' show you  
Baby I'm jealous  
Of the pictures that you like  
Baby I'm jealous  
Of the girls with lighter eyes  
Baby I'm jealous  
I'm jealous  
And I know that it ain't right you lied to me  
But I'm jealous jealous  
The jealous kind  
Yeah yeah yeah  
I'm jealous of her  
I need ya number  
B baby I'm  
She doesn't love ya  
Boy lemme show ya  
Baby I'm jealous  
I'm jealous of her  
I need ya number  
B baby I'm  
She doesn't love ya  
Boy lemme show ya  
Baby I'm jealous
