### Girls Talk Boys 歌词：

When the girls, when the girls talk  
When the girls talk boys  
Oh, when the girls, when the girls talk  
When the girls talk boys, hey

When you’re talking to your girls  
Do you talk about me?  
Do you say that I’m a sweetheart?  
Do you say that I’m a freak?  
Do you tell them white lies?  
Do you tell 'em the truth?  
Do you tell 'em that you love me  
The way I been lovin’ you?  
[Pre-Chorus: All]  
Cause every night you and I find ourselves  
Kissing and touching like no one else  
Falling and falling until I fell  
For you

Cause I been talking to my friends  
The way you take away my breath  
It’s something bigger than myself  
It’s something I don’t understand  
No, no  
I know we’re young and people change  
And we may never feel the same  
So baby tell me what you say  
When the girls, when the girls talk  
When the girls talk boys  
I can hear ‘em talking  
Oh, when the girls  
When the girls  
When the girls talk  
When the girls talk boys, hey

When you’re talking to your girls  
Do you talk about me?  
Do you tell I’m your lover?  
That I’m all that you need?  
Do you tell ‘em white lies?  
Do you tell ‘em the truth?  
(Do you tell 'em that you love me  
The way that I’ve been loving you?)

Cause every night you and I find ourselves  
Kissing and touching like no one else  
Falling and falling until I fell  
For you

Cause I been talking to my friends  
The way you take away my breath  
It’s something bigger than myself  
It’s something I don’t understand  
No, no  
I know we’re young and people change  
And we may never feel the same  
So baby tell me what you say  
When the girls, when the girls talk  
When the girls talk boys  
I can hear ‘em talking  
Oh, when the girls, when the girls talk  
When the girls talk boys, hey  
When the girls talk boys  
When the girls  
Talk talk talk talk  
Talk talk talk talk, hey
