### Nothing In The World歌词：

Liz McClarnon：  
It's been so long I can't remember when  
We didn't care how deep it was we dived right in  
Watching everything around us disappear  
Oh I've missed you here  
Natasha Hamilton：  
And it seems the little things get in the way  
We're so caught up in routine from day to day  
Sometimes it feels like we're not anchored anywhere  
Oh I've missed you yeah  
Both：  
So tell me there's nothing in the world  
That could ever come between us  
Show me you're not afraid tonight  
Baby make me believe  
That there's nothing in the world  
That could ever steal the moment from right here and now  
Nothing nothing in the world  
Jenny Frost：  
Two shadows falling back together now  
Baby we've spent too much time just hiding out  
And there's nowhere that I'd rather be than here  
'Cause I've missed you yeah  
Both：  
So tell me there's nothing in the world  
That could ever come between us  
Show me you're not afraid tonight  
Baby make me believe  
That there's nothing in the world  
That could ever steal the moment from right here and now  
Nothing nothing in the world  
Nothing in the world  
In the world  
There's nothing in the world  
So tell me there's nothing in the world  
That could ever come between us  
Show me you're not afraid tonight  
Baby make me believe  
That there's nothing in the world  
That could ever steal the moment from right here and now  
Nothing nothing  
So tell me there's nothing in the world  
That could ever come between us  
Show me you're not afraid tonight  
Baby make me believe  
That there's nothing in the world  
That could ever steal the moment from right here and now  
Nothing  
Right here and now  
So tell me there's nothing in the world  
That could ever come between us  
Show me you're not afraid tonight  
Baby make me believe
