《 **Everybody's Changing** 》是英国摇滚乐乐队Keane（基音乐队）演唱的歌曲。收录于专辑《Hopes and Fears
(2004)》中。

  

Keane（基音乐队）来自于英格兰南部一个名为“Battle”的小镇，乐队由主唱Tom Chaplin，键盘手Tim Rice-
Oxley和鼓手Richard Hughes三人组成。
和大多数英国孩子一样，三人自小便在一起踢球、探讨音乐、交换唱片。Tim曾在学校里学习钢琴，但是他很快就厌倦了那些古典乐，于是他开始在他的Casio键盘上谱写Buddy
Holly式的音乐，将他创作的音乐演奏给他的朋友们听。同时Richard也开始练习架子鼓并和Tim一起排练。随后，又加入了吉他手Dominic，再加上主唱Tom,
四人组成了乐队开始演奏Oasis、U2、Beatles类型的歌。另有名为寻女记Keane的电影。

Everybody's Changing歌词：

  

You say you wander your own land  
But when I think about it  
I don't see how you can  
You're aching, you're breaking  
And I can see the pain in your eyes  
Says everybody's changing  
And I don't know why

So little time  
Try to understand that I'm  
Trying to make a move just to stay in the game  
I try to stay awake and remember my name  
But everybody's changing  
And I don't feel the same

You're gone from here  
And soon you will disappear  
Fading into beautiful light  
Cause everybody's changing  
And I don't feel right

So little time  
Try to understand that I'm  
Trying to make a move just to stay in the game  
I try to stay awake and remember my name  
But everybody's changing  
And I don't feel the same

So little time  
Try to understand that I'm  
Trying to make a move just to stay in the game  
I try to stay awake and remember my name  
But everybody's changing  
And I don't feel the same
