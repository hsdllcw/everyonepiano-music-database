《 **Nothing Else Matters** 》是金属乐队Metallica乐队演唱的歌曲，收录于同名专辑《Metallica》中，1991年发行。

此曲创作的原因是纪念Metallica的成员Cliff
Burton，这位才华横溢的贝斯手在车祸中丧生。这首乐曲让这支男性化的摇滚乐队多了份柔情、多了份伤感。优美的前奏、演唱、和声，干净的间奏，以及JAMES弹的SOLO，整曲中各个乐器的相互配合堪称完美。

### Nothing Else Matters歌词：

No nothing else matters  
So close no matter how far  
Couldn't be much more from the heart  
Forever trust in who we are  
And nothing else matters  
Never opened myself this way  
Life is ours we live it our way  
All theese I don't just say  
And nothing else matters  
Trust I seek & I find in U  
Every day 4 us something new  
Open mind 4 a different view  
And nothing else matters  
Never cared 4 what they do  
Never cared 4 what they know  
But I know  
So close no matter how far  
Couldn't be much more from the heart  
Forever trust in who we are  
And nothing else matters  
Never cared 4 what they do  
Never cared 4 what they know  
But I know  
Never opened myself this way  
Life is ours we live it our way  
All theese I don't just say  
And nothing else matters  
Trust I seek & I find in U  
Every day 4 us something new  
Open mind 4 a different view  
And nothing else matters  
Never cared 4 what they say  
Never cared 4 games they play  
Never cared 4 what they do  
Never cared 4 what they know  
And I know  
So close no matter how far  
Couldn't be much more from the heart  
Forever trust in who we are
