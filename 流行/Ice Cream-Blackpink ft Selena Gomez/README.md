### Ice Cream歌词：

Come a little closer cause you looking thirsty  
Imma make it better sip it like a Slurpee  
Snow cone chilly  
Get it free like Willy  
In the jeans like Billie  
You be poppin' like a wheelie  
Even in the sun you know I keep it icy  
You could take a lick but it's too cold to bite me  
Brrr brrr frozen  
You're the one been chosen  
Play the part like Moses  
Keep it fresh like roses  
Look so good yeah look so sweet  
Looking good enough to eat  
Coldest with this kiss so he call me ice cream  
Catch me in the fridge right where the ice be  
Look so good yeah look so sweet
