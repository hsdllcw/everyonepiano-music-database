### Rise Like a Phoenix歌词：

Waking in the rubble  
Walking over glass  
Neighbors say we’re trouble  
Well that time has passed

Peering from the mirror  
No, that isn’t me  
Stranger getting nearer  
Who can this person be

You wouldnt know me at all today  
From the fading light I fly

Rise like a phoenix  
Out of the ashes  
Seeking rather than vengeance  
Retribution  
You were warned  
Once I'm transformed  
Once I’m reborn  
You know I will rise like a phoenix  
But you're my flame

Go about your business  
Act as if you’re free  
Noone could have witnessed  
What you did to me

Cause you wouldn’t know me today  
And you have got to see  
To believe  
From the fading light I fly

Rise like a phoenix  
Out of the ashes  
Seeking rather than vengeance  
Retribution  
You were warned  
Once I'm transformed  
Once I’m reborn

I rise up to the sky  
You threw me down but  
I'm gonna fly

And rise like a phoenix  
Out of the ashes  
Seeking rather than vengeance  
Retribution  
You were warned  
Once I'm transformed  
Once I’m reborn  
You know I will rise like a phoenix  
But you’re my flame
