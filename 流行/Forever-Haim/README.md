### Forever歌词：

Hey you!  
Remember me? Remember love?  
Remember trying to stay together?  
My time, you took it all.  
You tried to see.  
You tried to bring yourself up without involving me.  
It isn't fair, to have your way,  
To try and get up and go and na na na na now can't you see,  
It isn't fair to have your way,  
But I'm trying to get your attention and I need you to know that.  
Hey you! Hey you!  
Can't you make this thing?  
I know, I know, I know you ain't the one to play the game.  
Now I know I'm gonna go your way.  
Here we go, now I know, I know know know.  
Forever I try to make it right,  
Together we suck, end in sight,  
I'm tired of fighting the good fight,  
If you say the word then I'll say goodbye.  
Forever I see you and me,  
Forever I'll try for you and I,  
No I never believed in the reason,  
Just another good reason to get a ride.  
I don't want to turn around,  
So come on baby,  
Come on and try to let it out,  
Let it go.  
We're still the same,  
So come on baby,  
Kick to the sounds, figure it out,  
Let's get back to where we started out.  
Hey you! Hey you!  
Can't you make this thing?  
I know, I know, I know you ain't the one to play the game.  
Now I know I'm gonna go your way.  
Here we go, now I know, I know know know.  
Forever I try to make it right,  
Together we suck, end in sight,  
I'm tired of fighting the good fight,  
If you say the word then I'll say goodbye.  
Forever I see you and me,  
Forever I'll try for you and I,  
No I never believed in the reason,  
Just another good reason to get a ride.  
Go go go go get out, get out of my memory,  
No no no not tonight, I don't have the energy.  
Go go go go get out, get out of my memory,  
No no no not tonight, oh not tonight, oh not tonight.  
Forever I try to make it right,  
Together we suck, end in sight,  
I'm tired of fighting the good fight,  
If you say the word then I'll say goodbye.  
Forever I see you and me,  
Forever I'll try for you and I,  
No I never believed in the reason,  
Just another good reason to get a ride.  
Forever I try to make it right,  
Together we suck, end in sight,  
I'm tired of fighting the good fight,  
If you say the word then I'll say goodbye.  
Forever I see you and me,  
Forever I'll try for you and I,  
No I never believed in the reason,  
Just another good reason to get a ride.
