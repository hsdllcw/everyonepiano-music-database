### Bandit歌词：

It's funny the s**t I put on this song  
Ain't gon' sound nothin' like the s**t we was just doin'  
Oh yeah  
I just want bad b***hes  
Baddest them b***hes is the baddest uh uh  
When I take the molly I'm a savage  
Uh I say uh  
I don't need no molly to be savage uh  
When I'm on that molly I feel savage uh uh  
She the definition of a bad b***h  
Stole her I'm the definition of a bandit uh ayy  
I don't need no molly to be savage uh ayy  
But when I'm on the molly I feel savage  
Ayy my girl the definition of a bad b***h  
Stole her heart I'm the definition of a bandit  
Put the Percs down and picked up the jiggas jiggas jiggas  
Tommy in the f**king Tommy Hilfiger 'figer 'figer  
That Tommy hit a n***a Tommy Hilfiger f**k n***as  
I'm nice when I'm high off the pills I'ma f**k with her  
I don't smoke skunk but tonight I'm getting stuck n***a  
Pour the codeine up and put some molly  
In the cup with it  
I know she a freak uh-huh she gon' f**k with it  
She my velcro uh-huh guess I'm stuck with her  
I dive in it like a sailor I love to nail her  
Addicted to her paraphernalia I had to tell her  
I see it like a fortune teller  
Your ex-nigga did good I could do better  
Bad b***h from the woods I think she a hunter  
She a killer and an eater  
She a Jeffery Dahmer  
I can tell when she in her feelings  
I can read her like a book  
No TEC no Beretta FN on me am I understood  
Yeah yeah yeah  
I don't need no molly to be savage uh  
When I'm on that molly I feel savage uh uh  
She the definition of a bad b***h  
Stole her I'm the definition of a bandit uh ayy  
I don't need no molly to be savage uh ayy  
But when I'm on the molly I feel savage  
Ayy my girl the definition of a bad b***h  
Stole her heart I'm the definition of a bandit  
My brother point her out  
And she a bad b***h I'm on her  
Must ain't heard that I'm a savage  
Once I get a b***h I own her  
I see she got swag I got cash so I want her  
See this four-five in my pants  
Put on your a*s push up on bruh  
Shawty she a rider with that glizzy on her  
With that glizzy on her  
And shawty I'ma die there with no semi on me  
Semi on me  
If we got a problem we get rid of homie yeah  
Put fifty thousand in your pocket we gon' get  
The money yeah  
I'm the definition of a bandit come on bruh  
Took your heart from out his hands  
And still ain't saying s**t honest  
Some new killers in my circle you done ran with it  
Like this dirty 38 this b***h'll damage  
Popping wheelies 4K  
Trey call when you land with it pop pop pop  
I let you drive inside my bros  
Where they be laying with it  
I work this b***h I open up a can with it  
Like f**k the stove I make it jump  
Without my hand in it  
I don't need no molly to be savage uh  
When I'm on that molly I feel savage uh uh  
She the definition of a bad b***h  
Stole her I'm the definition of a bandit uh ayy  
I don't need no molly to be savage uh ayy  
But when I'm on the molly I feel savage  
Ayy my girl the definition of a bad b***h  
Stole her heart I'm the definition of a bandit
