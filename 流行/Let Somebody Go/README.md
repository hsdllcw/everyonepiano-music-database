### Let Somebody Go歌词：

We had a kind of love I thought that it would never end  
Oh my lover oh my other oh my friend  
We talked around in circles and we talked around and then  
I loved you to the moon and back again  
You gave everything this golden glow  
Now turn off all the stars cause this I know  
That it hurts like so to let somebody go  
All the storms we weathered  
Everything that we went through  
Now without you what on earth am I to do  
When I called the mathematicians  
And I asked them to explain  
They say love is only equal to the pain  
And when everything was going wrong  
You could turn my sorrow into song  
Oh it hurts like so to let somebody go  
To let somebody go  
Oh oh  
Let somebody let somebody  
Oh when you love somebody  
When you love somebody  
Got to let somebody know  
Oh when you love somebody  
When you love somebody  
Got to let somebody know  
So when you love somebody  
When you love somebody  
Then it hurts like so  
To let somebody go  
It hurts like so  
To let somebody go  
But you're still with me now I know  
Let somebody let somebody  
Oh oh  
Let somebody let somebody  
You're still with me now I know
