### Don't Call Me Up歌词：

When I'm underneath the bright lights  
When I'm tryna have a good time  
'Cause I'm good now you ain't mine  
Now now now now now don't call me up  
Call me up  
When you're looking at my photos  
Getting hot losing control  
You want me more now I let go  
Now now now now  
I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more  
'Cause the truth is without you boy I'm stronger  
Stronger stronger  
And I know it's sad that I changed have a cold heart  
But it was your game that left scars  
Ooh I'm over you  
Over you over you over you  
Don't call me up  
I'm going out tonight  
Feeling good now you're outta my life  
Don't wanna talk about us  
Gotta leave it behind  
One drink and you're outta my mind  
Now now take it up  
Baby I'm on a high  
You're alone going out of your mind  
But I'm here out in the club  
And I don't wanna talk  
So don't call me up  
'Cause I'm here looking fine babe  
And I got eyes looking my way  
And everybody's on my vibe babe  
Now now now now don't call me up  
Call me up  
My friends said you were a bad man  
I should have listened to them back then  
And now you're tryna hit me up again  
Now now now now  
I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more  
'Cause the truth is without you boy I'm stronger  
Stronger stronger  
And I know it's sad that I changed have a cold heart  
But it was your game that left scars  
Ooh I'm over you  
Over you over you over you  
Don't call me up  
I'm going out tonight  
Feeling good now you're outta my life  
Don't wanna talk about us  
Gotta leave it behind  
One drink and you're outta my mind  
Now now take it up  
Baby I'm on a high  
You're alone going out of your mind  
But I'm here out in the club  
And I don't wanna talk  
So don't call me up  
Tudo mundo tudo mundo  
Uda mains deis  
Urto bengo urto prowa uda mais deis  
Don't call me up  
Urto pungo mais deis

I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more  
'Cause the truth is without you boy I'm stronger  
And I know it's sad that I changed have a cold heart  
But it was your game that left scars  
Ooh I'm over you  
Over you over you over you  
Don't call me up  
I'm going out tonight  
Feeling good now you're outta my life  
Don't wanna talk about us  
Gotta leave it behind  
One drink and you're outta my mind  
Now now take it up  
Baby I'm on a high  
You're alone going out of your mind  
But I'm here out in the club  
And I don't wanna talk  
So don't call me up call me up
