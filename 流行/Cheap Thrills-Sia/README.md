**Cheap Thrills**
是澳大利亚慢速电子、流行兼爵士创作型女歌手Sia的歌曲。在20世纪90年代中期，Sia加入澳大利亚阿德莱德名为“Crisp”的
酸爵士乐队。1997年，乐队解散后，Sia通过Flavoured唱片公司发行了一张Trip-
hop风格的专辑《OnlySee》，但最终没有获得成功。之后，Sia迁至英国伦敦。

且 _Cheap Thrills_ 收录在Sia即将发行的第七张个人录音室专辑This Is
Acting中。在这张专辑中，Sia推陈出新，将假发一半涂黑，完成了阴阳波波头的伟大发明。她称这张专辑的歌都是她从前写给流行歌手但未被最终收录的歌曲，由于这些歌曲并非是表现她真实的个人心理，于是她将专辑命名为This
Is Acting。

### Cheap Thrills歌词：

Come on, come on, turn the radio on  
It's Friday night and I won't be long  
Gotta do my hair, I put my make up on  
It's Friday night and I won't be long

Til I hit the dance floor  
Hit the dance floor  
I got all I need  
No I ain't got cash  
No I ain't got cash  
But I got you baby

Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight  
(I love cheap thrills)  
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight  
(I love cheap thrills)  
But I don't need no money  
As long as I can feel the beat  
I don't need no money  
As long as I keep dancing

Come on, come on, turn the radio on  
It's Saturday and I won't be long  
Gotta paint my nails, put my high heels on  
It's Saturday and I won't be long

Til I hit the dance floor  
Hit the dance floor  
I got all I need  
No I ain't got cash  
No I ain't got cash  
But I got you baby

Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight  
(I love cheap thrills)  
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight  
(I love cheap thrills)  
But I don't need no money  
As long as I can feel the beat  
I don't need no money  
As long as I keep dancing

(I love cheap thrills)  
(I love cheap thrills)  
I don't need no money  
As long as I can feel the beat  
I don't need no money  
As long as I keep dancing

Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight  
(I love cheap thrills)  
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight  
(I love cheap thrills)  
I don't need no money  
As long as I can feel the beat  
I don't need no money  
As long as I keep dancing

La, la, la, la, la, la  
(I love cheap thrills)  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
(I love cheap thrills)  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
(I love cheap thrills)  
La, la, la, la, la  
(I love cheap thrills)
