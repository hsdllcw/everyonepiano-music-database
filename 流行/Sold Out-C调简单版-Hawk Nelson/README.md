### Sold Out歌词：

I ain't like no one you met before  
I'm running for the front  
When they're all running for the door  
And I won't sit down won't back out  
You can't ever shut me up  
Cause I'm on a mission  
And I won't quit now  
In a world full of followers  
I'll be a leader  
In a world full of doubters  
I'll be a believer  
I'm stepping out without a hesitation  
Because the battle's already been won  
I'm sold out  
I'm no longer living  
Just for myself  
Running after Jesus  
With my whole heart  
And now I'm ready to shout  
I am sold out  
I'm sold out  
With every single  
Step that I take now  
With every drop of blood  
Left in my veins  
I'm gonna be making it count  
I am sold out  
This ain't just some temporary phase  
You can't face this kind of grace  
And leave the way you came  
This is permanent with intent  
And there won't be no stopping it now  
I'm on a mission and it's heaven sent  
In a world full of followers  
I'll be a leader  
In a world full of doubters  
I'll be a believer  
I'm stepping out without a hesitation  
Cause my soul is like a stadium  
I'm sold out  
I'm no longer living  
Just for myself  
Running after Jesus  
With my whole heart  
And now I'm ready to shout  
I am sold out  
I'm sold out  
With every single  
Step that I take now  
With every drop of blood  
Left in my veins  
I'm gonna be making it count  
I am sold out  
No trials coming against me  
Could put a dent in my passion  
They're just an opportunity  
To put my faith into action  
In a world full of followers  
I'll be a leader  
In a world full of doubters  
I'll be a believer  
I'm stepping out without a hesitation  
I ain't got nothing left to be afraid of  
I'm sold out  
I'm no longer living  
Just for myself  
Running after Jesus  
With my whole heart  
And now I'm ready to shout  
I am sold out  
I'm sold out  
With every single  
Step that I take now  
With every drop of blood  
Left in my veins  
I'm gonna be making it count  
I am sold out
