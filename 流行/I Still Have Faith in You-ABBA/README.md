乐队重聚，《 _I Still Have Faith In You_
》。正如他们自己说的“显然我们都知道彼此一直有着深情厚谊。我们不时会见面，但当我们第一次为了这张专辑一起走进录音室的时候，才格外清楚地感受到那份情谊。这种感觉有点怪，又美妙至极。一切都重现在我们的眼前，就好像昨天才发生一样。对我们四个来说，这是一种非常熟悉和寻常的情景。”

### I Still Have Faith in You歌词：

I still have faith in you  
I see it now  
Through all these years that faith lives on somehow  
There was a union  
Of heart and mind  
The likes of which are rare and oh-so hard to find  
Do I have it in me  
I believe it is in there  
For I know I hear a bittersweet song  
In the memories we share  
I still have faith in you  
And I will say  
I never really thought I'd feel this way  
But I remind myself  
Of who we are  
How inconceivable is it to reach this far  
Do I have it in me  
I believe it is in there  
For I know I hear a bittersweet song  
In the memories we share  
We do have it in us  
New spirit has arrived  
The joy and the sorrow  
We have a story  
And it survived  
And we need one another  
Like fighters in a ring  
We're in this together  
Passion and courage  
Is everything  
I still have faith in you  
It stands above the crazy things we did  
It all comes down to love  
Do I have it in me  
I believe it is in there  
For I know I hear a bittersweet song  
In the memories we share  
Do I have it in me  
We do have it in us  
New spirit has arrived  
The joy and the sorrow  
We have a story  
And it survived  
And we know that we need one another  
Like fighters in a ring  
We're in this together  
Passion and courage  
Is everything  
I still have faith in you  
And we still have it in us  
We've only just arrived  
Do I have it in me  
We stand on a summit  
Humble and grateful  
To have survived  
I still have faith in you  
It stands above the crazy things we did  
It all comes down to love  
Do I have it in me
