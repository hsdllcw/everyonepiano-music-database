《 **All Too Well** 》，中文《回忆太清晰》，是美国创作歌手Taylor
Swift的一首歌曲，收录于第4张录音室专辑《红》中。该曲的十分钟版本《All Too Well (10 Minute
Version)》则于2021年11月12日被收录在Taylor的重制专辑《Red (Taylor's Version)》。

这是一首宏伟的歌曲，该歌曲乡村风格浓重、美轮美奂，Taylor回归了更加伤感和直白的抒情歌谣中；论曲，歌曲较为冗余，但论词，歌曲细节充实，适合收录在《Speak
Now》，其内容甚至涉及到一些与《Mine》相同的主题，然而放入《Red》中则是为了提醒人们——Taylor的歌曲不会脱离这类曲风。

### All Too Well歌词：

I walked through the door with you  
The air was cold  
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow and I  
Left my scarf there at your sister's house  
And you've still got it  
In your drawer even now  
Oh your sweet disposition  
And my wide eyed gaze  
We're singing in the car getting lost upstate  
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place  
And I can picture it after all these days  
And I know it's long gone and  
That magic's not here no more  
And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all  
Oh oh oh  
'Cause there we are again on that little town street  
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me  
Wind in my hair I was there I remember it all too well  
Photo album on the counter  
Your cheeks were turning red  
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed  
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on a tee ball team  
You tell me about your past thinking your future was me  
And I know it's long gone and  
There was nothing else I could do  
And I forget about you long enough  
To forget why I needed to  
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night  
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light  
Down the stairs I was there I remember it all too well yeah  
Maybe we got lost in translation  
Maybe I asked for too much  
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece  
'til you tore it all up  
Running scared I was there I remember it all too well  
Hey you call me up again just to break me like a promise  
So casually cruel in the name of being honest  
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here  
'Cause I remember it all all all  
Too well  
Time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it  
I'd like to be my old self again  
But I'm still trying to find it  
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own  
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone  
But you keep my old scarf  
From that very first week  
'Cause it reminds you of innocence  
And it smells like me  
You can't get rid of it  
'Cause you remember it all too well yeah  
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so  
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known  
It was rare I was there I remember it all too well  
Wind in my hair you were there you remember it all  
Down the stairs you were there you remember it all  
It was rare I was there I remember it all too well
