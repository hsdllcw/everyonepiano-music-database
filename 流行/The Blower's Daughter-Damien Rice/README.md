**The Blower's Daughter** 来自于创作型歌手Damien
Rice在2003年发行的专辑《O》。该专辑的封面背景是一片米白色，有两个小小的手绘人像，默默的宣示这是张简单的民谣专辑。Damien
Rice出生于70年代早期，以摇滚风格开始音乐之路，但在这张专辑里面你实在听不出来，大量的空心吉它和弦，轻松打击乐器低调而简约的伴奏，间或有一些华丽悲伤弦乐来烘托气氛，没有多余的花俏来转移焦点，只为呈现Damien
Rice 那充份蕴含情感的歌声，一起构成了一个亲密却伤感的空间，精致而干净。

对于《 _The Blower's Daughter_ 》来说，之前已被美国热映电视剧《THE L
WORLD》第一季结尾处作为整季SHOW的终曲，可见是首多么打动人心的作品了。

### The Blower's Daughter歌词：

And so it is  
Just like you said it would be  
Life goes easy on me  
Most of the time  
And so it is  
The shorter story  
No love, no glory  
No hero in her sky

I can't take my eyes off of you  
I can't take my eyes off you  
I can't take my eyes off of you  
I can't take my eyes off you  
I can't take my eyes off you  
I can't take my eyes...

And so it is  
Just like you said it should be  
We'll both forget the breeze  
Most of the time  
And so it is  
The colder water  
The blower's daughter  
The pupil in denial

I can't take my eyes off of you  
I can't take my eyes off you  
I can't take my eyes off of you  
I can't take my eyes off you  
I can't take my eyes off you  
I can't take my eyes...

Did I say that I loathe you?  
Did I say that I want to  
Leave it all behind?

I can't take my mind off of you  
I can't take my mind off you  
I can't take my mind off of you  
I can't take my mind off you  
I can't take my mind off you  
I can't take my mind...  
My mind...my mind...  
'Til I find somebody new
