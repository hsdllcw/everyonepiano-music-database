### Stay with Me歌词：

Guess it's true  
I'm not good  
At a one night stand  
But I still need love  
Cos I'm just a man  
These nights never seem to go to plan  
I don't want you to leave  
Will you hold my hand  
Oh won't you  
Stay with me  
Cos you're  
All I need  
This ain't love  
It's clear to see  
But darling  
Stay with me  
Why am I so emotional?  
No it's not a good look  
Gain some self control  
Deep down I know this never works  
But you can lay with me  
So it doesn't hurt  
Oh won't you  
Stay with me  
Cos you're  
All I need  
This ain't love  
It's clear to see  
But darling  
Stay with me  
Oh won't you  
Stay with me  
Cos you're  
All I need  
This ain't love  
It's clear to see  
But darling  
Stay with me  
Oh won't you  
Stay with me  
Cos you're  
All I need  
This ain't love  
It's clear to see  
But darling  
Stay with me
