_Talk_ 是美国新晋男团Why Don't We发行的新单。组合由来自美国各州的五个多才多艺男孩组成，他们分别是：Corbyn Besson、Jonah
Marais、Jack Avery、Zach Herron、Daniel Seavey。

不同于上一首节奏轻快的大热单曲"Hooked"，"Talk"的曲风更多地带有慵懒悠闲的流行色彩，当然也少不了几位男孩立刻抓住你耳朵的人声以及诱人的舞蹈律动节拍，相信歌迷们一定会爱上Why
Don't We这首新歌！

### Talk歌词：

Zach Herron：  
It's not just me no you feel it too  
You know and I know we lost the lotto'  
It's like our love cut the line in two  
We're on different sides though lost in the echo  
Daniel Seavey：  
Our lips are moving they're makin' words  
Words turn to riddles we make it worse  
'Cause I'm not listening and you're not listening no  
We try to fix it it never works  
Jonah Marais：  
We go breaking up like cell phones  
When I speak 'cause you don't listen when I talk  
Dial tone nothing but that high note  
When you speak 'cause I don't listen when you talk  
Daniel Seavey/Jonah Marais：  
Ooh yeah don't think we'll ever get better better  
Gets worse with every letter letter  
Dial tone nothing but that high note  
On repeat 'cause we don't listen when we talk  
Corbyn Besson：  
If we could speak like we're trying to  
Share conversation communication  
I'm hearing me and you're hearing you  
On different islands just sounds of silence  
Daniel Seavey/Jack Avery：  
Our lips are moving they're makin' words  
Oh  
Words turn to riddles we make it worse  
'Cause I'm not listening  
I'm not listening  
And you're not listening  
You're not listening  
No  
We try to fix it it never works  
Hey  
Jonah Marais：  
We go breaking up like cell phones  
When I speak 'cause you don't listen when I talk  
Dial tone nothing but that high note  
When you speak 'cause I don't listen when you talk  
Daniel Seavey/Jonah Marais：  
Ooh yeah don't think we'll ever get better better  
Gets worse with every letter letter  
Dial tone nothing but that high note  
On repeat 'cause we don't listen when we talk  
Jack Avery/Corbyn Besson/Daniel Seavey：  
Our lips are moving they're making words  
They're making words  
Words turn to riddles we make it worse  
'Cause I'm not listening  
I'm not listening  
And you're not listening  
You're not listening  
No  
We try to fix it it never works  
Oh  
Jonah Marais：  
We go breaking up like cell phones  
When I speak 'cause you don't listen when I talk  
Dial tone nothing but that high note  
When you speak 'cause I don't listen when you talk  
Daniel Seavey/Jonah Marais/Jack Avery：  
Listen when you talk yeah  
Ooh yeah don't think we'll ever get better better  
Don't think we'll ever get better no  
Gets worse with every letter letter  
Worse with every letter  
Dial tone nothing but that high note  
Nothing but that high note  
On repeat 'cause we don't listen when we talk  
Talk
