### Tough歌词：

Every little part of me is holding onto every little piece you  
It's holding on to every drop of blood you drew  
It's holding onto you  
And every waking hour I spend  
Holding out for reasons not to go to bed  
I'm holding out for someone else to hold instead  
If every hope of you is dead  
'Cause every night since you cut and run  
I feel like the only one who's ever been the lonely one  
Trying to mend a heart that keeps breaking  
With every step that you're taking  
'Cause you've been running circles 'round  
My mind turning me inside out  
And I fell for you but hit the ground  
'Cause the only love I've known has let me  
Down and I need lifting up  
Now you ain't here I'm sleeping rough  
And I'm praying I can pray enough  
So waking up without you ain't so tough  
Find it hard to find my feet  
When I keep on stumbling over you and me  
But I keep on trying 'cause I know I need  
To outrun the memories  
And every day I'm reminded of the way  
I let it come undone  
I feel like the lonely one  
The only one with time worth wasting  
Well I still can't stop chasing  
'Cause you've been running circles 'round  
My mind turning me inside out  
And I fell for you but hit the ground  
'Cause the only love I've known has let me  
Down and I need lifting up  
Now you ain't here I'm sleeping rough  
And I'm praying I can pray enough  
So waking up without you ain't so tough oh  
Tough oh tough  
So waking up without you  
Say I  
Thought I was talking to you  
Say I  
I guess I'm talking to myself  
Me and nobody else  
'Cause you've been running circles 'round  
My mind turning me inside out  
And I fell for you but hit the ground  
'Cause the only love I've known has let me  
Down and I need lifting up  
Now you ain't here I'm sleeping rough  
And I'm praying I can pray enough  
So waking up without you ain't so tough
