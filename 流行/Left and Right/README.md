### Left and Right歌词：

Memories follow me left and right  
I can feel you over here  
I can feel you over here  
You take up every corner of my mind  
Whatcha gon' do now  
Ever since the da-day y-you went away  
No I don't know how  
How to erase your body from out my brain  
Whatcha gon' do now  
Maybe I should just focus on me instead  
But all I think about  
Are the nights we were tangled up in your bed  
Oh no  
Oh no  
Oh no  
Oh no  
You're going 'round in circles  
Got you stuck up in my head  
Yeah  
Memories follow me left and right  
I can feel you over here  
I can feel you over here  
You take up every corner of my mind  
Your love stays with me day and night  
I can feel you over here  
l can feel you over here  
You take up every corner of my mind  
Whatcha gon' do now  
Ever since the da-day y-you went away  
Someone tell me how  
How much more do I gotta drink for the pain  
Whatcha gon' do now  
You did things to me that I just can't forget  
Now all I think about  
Are the nights we were tangled up in your bed  
Oh no  
Oh no  
Oh no  
Oh no  
You're going round in circles got ya stuck up in my head  
Eah  
Memories follow me left and right  
I can feel you over here I can feel you over here  
You take up every corner of my mind  
Your love stays with me day and night  
I can feel you over here  
I can feel you over here  
You take up every corner of my mind  
Whatcha gon' do now  
Did ya know you're the one that got away  
And even now baby I'm still not okay  
Did ya know that my dreams they're are the same  
Everytime I close my eyes  
Memories follow me left and right  
I can feel you over here  
I can feel you over here  
You take up every corner of my mind  
Whatcha gon' do now  
Your love stays with me day and night  
I can feel you over here  
l can feel you over here  
You take up every corner of my mind  
Whatcha gon' do now  
I can feel you over here  
I can feel you over here  
You take up every corner of my mind  
Whatcha gon' do now
