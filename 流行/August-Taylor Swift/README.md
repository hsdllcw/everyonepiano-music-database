**August** 是由美国女歌手Taylor
Swift录唱的一首歌曲，被收录在Taylor于2020年7月24日发行的第八张录音室专辑《folklore》，为其所属专辑中的第八首歌曲。后于2020年8月8日，此曲空降在公告牌百强单曲榜的第23位。

《Folklore》是一张突破Taylor固有风格的专辑，她的声音变得冷静而节制，不再有之前汹涌的控诉和骄傲的自信，多的是于无声处听惊雷的力量，她仿佛卸下了束缚和愤怒，转而陷入思索。隔离生活让Taylor在该专辑中变得比以往更加温柔，甚至有些忧伤，她重拾她拿手的风格，用简单的音乐形式将一个个故事娓娓道来。

### August歌词：

Salt air  
And the rust on your door  
I never needed anything more  
Whispers  
Of are you sure  
Never have I ever before  
But I can see us  
Lost in the memory  
August slipped away  
Into a moment in time  
Cause it was never mine  
And I can see us  
Twisted in bedsheets  
August sipped away  
Like a bottle of wine  
Cause you were never mine  
Your back  
Beneath the sun  
Wishing I could write my name on it  
Will you call when you're back at school  
I remember thinking I had you  
But I can see us  
Lost in the memory  
August slipped away  
Into a moment in time  
Cause it was never mine  
And I can see us  
Twisted in bedsheets  
August sipped away  
Like a bottle of wine  
Cause you were never mine  
Back when we were still changing for the better  
Wanting was enough  
For me it was enough  
To live for the hope of it all  
Cancel plans just in case you'd call  
And say meet me behind the mall  
So much for summer love and saying us  
Cause you weren't mine to lose  
You weren't mine to lose  
No  
But I can see us  
Lost in the memory  
August slipped away  
Into a moment in time  
Cause it was never mine  
And I can see us  
Twisted in bedsheets  
August sipped away  
Like a bottle of wine  
Cause you were never mine  
Cause you were never mine  
Never mine  
Do you remember  
Remember when I pulled up  
And said get in the car  
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call  
Back when I was living for the hope of it all  
For the hope of it all  
Meet me behind the mall  
Remember when I pulled up  
And said get in the car  
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call  
Back when I was living for the hope of it all  
For the hope of it all
