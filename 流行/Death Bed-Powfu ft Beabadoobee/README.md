### Death Bed歌词：

Don't stay awake for too long don't go to bed  
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head  
It'll get you up and going out of bed  
Powfu：  
Yeah I don't wanna fall asleep  
I don't wanna pass away  
I been thinking of our future  
'Cause I'll never see those days  
I don't know why this has happened  
But I probably deserve it  
I tried to do my best but you know that I'm not perfect  
I been praying for forgiveness  
You've been praying for my health  
When I leave this earth  
Hopin' you'll find someone else  
'Cause yeah we still young  
There's so much we haven't done  
Getting married start a family  
Watch your husband with his son  
I wish it could be me  
But I won't make it out this bed  
I hope I go to heaven so I see you once again  
My life was kinda short  
But I got so many blessings  
Happy you were mine  
It sucks that it's all ending  
Beabadoobee/Powfu：  
Don't stay awake for too long don't go to bed  
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head  
It'll get you up and going out of bed  
Yeah ayy  
Don't stay awake for too long don't go to bed  
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head  
It'll get you up and going out of bed  
Ayy yeah  
Powfu：  
I'm happy that you're here with me  
I'm sorry if I tear up  
When me and you were younger  
You would always make me cheer up  
Taking goofy videos and walking through the park  
You would jump into my arms every time you heard a bark  
Cuddle in your sheets sang me sound asleep  
I sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1：03  
Sundays went to church on Mondays watched a movie  
Soon you'll be alone sorry that you have to lose me  
Beabadoobee/Powfu：  
Don't stay awake for too long  
Don't go to bed  
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head  
It'll get you up and going out of bed  
Don't stay awake for too long  
Don't go to bed  
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head  
It'll get you up and going out of bed  
Don't stay awake for too long  
Don't go to bed  
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head  
It'll get you up and going out of bed  
Don't stay awake for too long  
Don't go to bed  
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head  
It'll get you up and going out of bed  
Beabadoobee：  
Don't stay awake for too long  
Don't go to bed  
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head  
It'll get you up and going out of bed
