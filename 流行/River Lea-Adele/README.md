**River Lea双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_River Lea_ 是英国流行歌手Adele的歌曲，收录在其2015年新专辑《25》中，且是此专辑的第7首。

Adele复古灵魂乐的唱腔风格，也让自己的音乐受众，往往是一些比较成熟的歌迷着迷。这些成熟的歌迷，可以在Adele身上听到传统流行乐黄金时代的味道，而他们的消费行为，同样也是理性且传统的。他们更愿意通过聆听一张唱片的方式，去了解一个更完整的Adele。而实体CD唱片、甚至黑胶唱片，则是搭配这种习惯的最佳方式。这张被寄予厚望的专辑，也在美国市场以570万张的首周销量，创造了一项新的音乐纪录。

### River Lea歌词：

Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on  
And I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young  
But my heart is a valley, it's so shallow and man made  
I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake  
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch  
But I know that's just me cause nothing ever is enough  
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea  
There was something in the water, now that something's in me  
Oh I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips  
I can't go back to the river

But it's in my roots, in my veins  
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain  
Oh, It's in my roots, in my veins  
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain

So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea  
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea

I should probably tell you now before it's way too late  
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face  
Consider this my apology, I know it's years in advance  
But I'd rather say it now in case I never get the chance  
No I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips  
I can't go back to the river

But it's in my roots, in my veins  
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain  
Oh, It's in my roots, in my veins  
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain

So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea  
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea  
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea  
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea

River Lea, River Lea  
River Lea, River Lea  
River Lea, River Lea  
River Lea, River Lea  
The River Lea-Lea-Lea-Lea  
The River Lea-Lea-Lea-Lea  
The River Lea-Lea-Lea-Lea  
The River Lea-Lea-Lea-Lea
