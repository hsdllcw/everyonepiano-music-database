**Solar Power双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Solar Power_
由新西兰创作型女歌手Lorde演唱，发行于2021年6月10日。Lorde是有个性的，她不刻意讨好观众，可以从上张专辑看出她更喜欢非旋律记忆性的歌曲，而是很大胆地将歌曲结构改造，强化主歌部分，这首歌也运用的很到位，后面的和声更是突出了阳光力量的感觉，从个人声线与合成器的交错到合唱出的感情大迸发，甚至再到最后的戛然而止体现出的也是意犹未尽。

### Solar Power歌词：

I hate the winter  
Can't stand the cold  
I tend to cancel all the plans  
So sorry I can't make it  
But when the heat comes  
Something takes a hold  
Can I kick it  
Yeah I can  
My cheeks in high colour overripe peaches  
No shirt no shoes only my features  
My boy behind me he's taking pictures  
Lead the boys and girls onto the beaches  
Come one come all I'll tell you my secrets  
I'm kinda like a prettier Jesus  
Forget all of the tears that you've cried  
It's over over over over  
It's a new state of mind  
Are you coming my baby  
Acid green aquamarine  
The girls are dancing in the sand  
And I throw my cellular device in the water  
Can you reach me  
No you can't  
My cheeks in high colour overripe peaches  
No shirt no shoes only my features  
My boy behind me he's taking pictures  
He's taking pictures  
Lead the boys and girls onto the beaches  
Come one come all I'll tell you my secrets  
I'm kinda like a prettier Jesus  
Turn it on in a new kind of bright  
It's solar solar solar solar  
Come on and let the bliss begin  
Blink three times when you feel it kickin' in  
That solar power  
Solar power  
Solar power  
Solar power  
Solar power  
Solar power
