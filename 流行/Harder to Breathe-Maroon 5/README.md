**Harder to Breathe** 是摇滚乐队Maroon 5所演唱的一首歌曲。Maroon
5融合了红色的狂野魅力，神秘热情，奔放烈爱再掺入摇滚力道，灵魂旋律及放克节奏，这样的红流泻着新灵魂乐性感风情的放克摇滚这样的红，在流行歌坛注入了一股新的颜色。

另外， _Harder To Breathe_
发行于2002年，然后开始口耳相传地慢慢走红，到了2003年夏天更成为歌迷的最爱之一，打入全美单曲榜第18名，而收录”Harder To
Breathe”的专辑《Songs About Jane》也连带获得全美专辑榜第七名的佳绩。这首单曲气势很强，但不同于老五其他歌曲（如This
love、Misery）一强一弱的节奏，也不同于she will be loved这样的抒情慢歌，是老五为数不多的曲风。

### Harder to Breathe歌词：

How dare you say that my behavior's unacceptable  
So condescending, unnecessarily critical  
I have the tendency of getting very physical  
So watch your step, cause if I do, you'll need a miracle  
You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here  
The double vision I was seeing, is finally clear  
You want to stay, but you know very well I want you gone  
Not fit to fuckin tread the ground I am walking on

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love  
You'll understand what I mean when I say there's no way we're gonna give up  
and like a little girl that cries in the face of a monster that lives in her
dreams  
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe  
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head  
You should know better, you never listened to a word I said  
Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat  
Hoping somebody, someday, will do you like I did

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love  
You'll understand what I mean when I say there's no way we're gonna give up  
and like a little girl that cries in the face of a monster that lives in her
dreams  
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe  
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

Does it kill  
Does it burn  
Is it painful to learn that it's me that has all the control  
Does it thrill  
Does it sting  
When you feel what I bring and you wish you had me to hold

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love  
You'll understand what I mean when I say there's no way we're gonna give up  
and like a little girl that cries in the face of a monster that lives in her
dreams  
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe  
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe  
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
