### Champagne Problems歌词：

You booked the night train for a reason  
So you could sit there in this hurt  
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers  
You're not sure which is worse  
Because I dropped your hand while dancing  
Left you out there standing  
Crestfallen on the landing  
Champagne problems  
Your mom's ring in your pocket  
My picture in your wallet  
Your heart was glass I dropped it  
Champagne problems  
You told your family for a reason  
You couldn't keep it in  
Your sister splashed out on the bottle  
Now no one's celebrating  
Dom Perignon you brought it  
No crowd of friends applauded  
Your hometown skeptics called it  
Champagne problems  
You had a speech you're speechless  
Love slipped beyond your reaches  
And I couldn't give a reason  
Champagne problems  
Your Midas touch on the Chevy door  
November flush and your flannel cure  
"This dorm was once a madhouse"  
I made a joke "well it's made for me"  
How evergreen our group of friends  
Don't think we'll say that word again  
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls  
That we once walked through  
One for the money two for the show  
I never was ready so I watch you go  
Sometimes you just don't know the answer  
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you  
"She would've made such a lovely bride  
What a shame she's f**ked in the head "they said  
But you'll find the real thing instead  
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred  
And hold your hand while dancing  
Never leave you standing  
Crestfallen on the landing  
With champagne problems  
Your mom's ring in your pocket  
Her picture in your wallet  
And you won't remember all my  
Champagne problems  
You won't remember all my  
Champagne problems
