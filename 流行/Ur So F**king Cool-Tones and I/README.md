### Ur So F**king Cool歌词：

Everyone's talkin' 'bout s*x  
Everyone's talkin' 'bout ex  
Like no one really wants to find a genuine connect  
Before they even look at you they move on to the next  
And I know that they say  
Don't you worry I'm the one  
Then the very next day they said they're done  
And I don't want to listen to the s**t you've spun  
No I don't want to listen to the s**t you've spun  
Walk into a party feelin' out of place  
Everyone's too cool everyone's too fake  
I try to start a conversation but I can't seem to relate  
Yo I'm about to get an Uber  
'Cause you're so f**king cool  
You're just way too f**king cool  
And I don't really care if you're king  
And I don't really care for gold things  
You'll be pointing at some girls and saying "Yeah we had a fling"  
But you're not fooling me  
You're just a puppet on a string  
Just a puppet on a string oh  
And they say "Don't you worry I'm the one"  
Then the very next day they said they're done  
And I don't want to listen to the s**t you've spun  
No I don't want to listen to the s**t you've spun  
Walk into a party feelin' out of place  
Everyone's too cool everyone's too fake  
I try to start a conversation but I can't seem to relate  
'Cause you're so f**king cool  
You're just way too f**king cool  
'Cause you're so f**king cool  
Walk into a party feelin' out of place  
Everyone's too cool everyone's too fake  
You're just way too f**king cool  
Walk into a party feelin' out of place  
'Cause you're so f**king cool  
Where have all my friends gone  
I seem to have lost them on my way  
And now their spots are filled with Ken dolls  
That tell me that I have got to stay  
'Cause you're so f**king cool  
You're just way too f**king cool  
'Cause you're so f**king cool  
Walk into a party feelin' out of place  
Everyone's too cool everyone's too fake  
You're just way too f**king cool  
Walk into a party feelin' out of place  
'Cause you're so f**king cool
