### Stronger歌词：

[Verse 1:]  
You know the bed feels warmer  
Sleeping here alone  
You know I dream in color  
And do the things I want

[Pre-Chorus 1:]  
You think you got the best of me  
Think you've had the last laugh  
Bet you think that everything good is gone  
Think you left me broken down  
Think that I'd come running back  
Baby you don't know me, cause you're dead wrong  
[Chorus, part A:]  
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger  
Stand a little taller  
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone  
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter  
Footsteps even lighter  
Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone

[Chorus, part B:]  
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger  
Just me, myself, and I  
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger  
Stand a little taller  
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

[Verse 2:]  
You heard that I was starting over with someone new  
They told you I was moving on, over you

[Pre-Chorus 2:]  
You didn't think that I'd come back  
I'd come back swinging  
You tried to break me, but you see

[Chorus, parts A & B]

[Bridge:]  
Thanks to you I got a new thing started  
Thanks to you I'm not the broken-hearted  
Thanks to you I'm finally thinking about me  
You know in the end the day you left was just my beginning  
In the end

[Chorus, parts A & B]

[Outro:]  
(When I'm alone)
