**Diamonds** 是英国创作型男歌手Sam Smith的歌曲，收录在其第三张专辑《Love Goes》中。歌曲本身不仅旋律抓耳，Sam
Smith本人在MV中的现代舞蹈也让人留下相当深刻的印象。

Sam
Smith表示：“我很兴奋的想和大家分享即将发行的第三张专辑，这张专辑收录了我在过去两年所创作的歌曲，每一首都有不同的故事。过去两年是我一生当中最具实验性的时刻，不管是在我个人生活或是音乐上都是。每当我走进录音室的那刻，我一直承诺自己不要受到局限，而结果也非常的不可思议，不仅很疗愈也很有趣。我对音乐的热爱很广泛，没有罪恶感，没有羞耻感，只是对唱歌、创作和跳舞有纯粹的热爱。”

### Diamonds歌词：

Diamonds diamonds diamonds diamonds  
Diamonds diamonds diamonds diamonds  
Diamonds diamonds diamonds diamonds  
Diamonds diamonds diamonds diamonds  
Have it all rip our memories off the wall  
All the special things I bought  
They mean nothing to me anymore  
But to you they were everything we were  
They meant more than every word  
Now I know just what you love me for mm  
Take all the money you want from me  
Hope you become what you want to be  
Show me how little you care  
How little you care how little you care  
You dream of glitter and gold  
My heart's already been sold  
Show you how little I care  
How littlе I care how little I care  
My diamonds leave with you mmm  
You're never gonna hear my heart break mmm  
Never gonna move in dark ways mmm  
Baby you're so cruel  
My diamonds leave with you mmm  
Material love won't fool me mmm  
When you're not here I can't breathe mmm  
Think I always knew  
My diamonds leave with you  
Diamonds diamonds diamonds diamonds  
Shake it off shake the fear of feeling lost  
Always me that pays the cost  
I should never trust so easily  
You lied to me lie-lied to me  
Then left with my heart 'round your chest mmm  
Take all the money you want from me  
Hope you become what you want to be  
Show me how little you care  
How little you care how little you care  
You dream of glitter and gold  
My heart's already been sold  
Show you how little I care  
How little I care how little I care  
My diamonds leave with you mmm  
You're never gonna hear my heart break mmm  
Never gonna move in dark ways mmm  
Baby you're so cruel  
My diamonds leave with you mmm  
Material love won't fool me mmm  
When you're not here I can't breathe mmm  
Think I always knew  
My diamonds leave with you  
Diamonds diamonds diamonds diamonds  
Woah-oh diamonds diamonds diamonds diamonds  
Woah-oh diamonds diamonds diamonds diamonds  
Always knew my diamonds leave with you

You're never gonna hear my heart break  
Never gonna move in dark ways  
Baby you're so cruel  
My diamonds leave with you  
Material love won't fool me  
When you're not here I can't breathe  
Think I always knew  
My diamonds leave with you oh-whoa  
You're never gonna hear my heart break mmm  
Never gonna move in dark ways mmm  
Baby you're so cruel so cruel  
My diamonds leave with you mmm  
Material love won't fool me mmm  
When you're not here I can't breathe mmm
