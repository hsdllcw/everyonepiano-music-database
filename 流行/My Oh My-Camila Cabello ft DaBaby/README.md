### My Oh My歌词：

Camila Cabello：  
Ha ha ha ha  
They say he likes a good time  
My oh my  
He comes alive at midnight  
Every night  
My mama doesn't trust him  
My oh my  
He's only here for one thing but  
So am I  
Yeah a little bit older a black leather jacket  
A bad reputation insatiable habits  
He was onto me one look and I couldn't breathe yeah  
I said if he kissed me I might let it happened  
Oh  
I swear on my life that I've been a good girl  
Oh  
Tonight I don't wanna be her  
Camila Cabello/DaBaby：  
They say he likes a good time  
My oh my  
He comes alive at midnight  
Every night  
My mama doesn't trust him  
My oh my  
He's only here for one thing but  
Let's go  
So am I  
DaBaby/Camila Cabello：  
Look I'm the type to make her turn on her daddy  
Oh yeah  
DaBaby make her forget what she learned from her daddy  
Ah ha ha  
I don't be tripping on lil' shawty  
I let her do whatever she please  
I don't be kissing on lil' shawty  
She don't be kissing on me either  
She came with you then left with me  
I went up a point let's call it even  
Yeah yeah  
Don't like the car she in gon' end up buyin' her a new Beamer  
Let's go  
That girl know what she want  
She make me take it off when she see me  
Let's go  
She say I make her wet whenever my face pop up on TV  
I had to say "No disrespect gotta do it safe for you to keep it"  
Pop star I'm fresh up out the trap and I'm going Bieber  
She know I'm call away she drop a pin and I'd come met her  
Stand up next to me you gon' end up catchin' a fever  
Yeah yeah  
I'm hot  
Camila Cabello：  
I swear on my life that I've been a good girl  
Good girl good girl  
Tonight I don't wanna be her  
Camila Cabello：  
They say he likes a good time  
My oh my  
He comes alive at midnight  
Every time  
He comes alive oh every night  
My mama doesn't trust him  
My oh my  
He's only here for one thing but  
So am I  
Camila Cabello：  
My my my my my oh my  
My mama doesn't trust you baby  
My my my my my oh my  
And my daddy doesn't know you no  
My my my my my oh my  
My my my my my oh my

Camila Cabello：  
They say he likes a good time

Every night

My oh my  
He's only here for one thing but  
So am I
