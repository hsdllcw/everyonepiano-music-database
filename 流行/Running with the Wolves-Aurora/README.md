### Running with the Wolves歌词：

Go row the boat to safer grounds  
But don't you know we're stronger now  
My heart still beats and my skin still feels  
My lungs still breathe my mind still fears  
But we're running out of time time

I'm running with the wolves  
It can cause between the hearts  
I can't be dreaming  
The night deceives us  
A million voice inside my dreams  
My heart is left so incomplete  
I'm running with the  
I'm running with the wolves  
I'm running with the  
I'm running with the  
I'm running with the  
I'm running with the wolves  
I'm running with the wolves tonight  
I'm running with the wolves  
I'm running with the wolves tonight  
I'm running with the wolves  
I'm running with the wolves tonight  
I'm running with the wolves  
I'm running with the wolves tonight  
I'm running with the wolves  
I'm running with the
