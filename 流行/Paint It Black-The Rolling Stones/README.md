**Paint It Black** 是滚石乐队(The Rolling Stones)的歌曲。滚石乐队(The Rolling
Stones)的名字取自于前辈艺人Muddy
Waters的一首蓝调歌曲“Rollin‘Stones”。是音乐史上最杰出的乐队之一，流行乐史上最重要的乐队之一，摇滚史上最有影响的乐队之一，现场演出表现最棒的乐队之一，是摇滚史上最成功和最长寿的乐队之一。他们的即兴节奏编配极为适合现场演出中的尽情挥洒，而他们狂野不羁的身体语言则几乎为后世所有的摇滚乐现场演出定出了规范，摇滚融合蓝调的粗犷风格。“滚石”具有更强的攻击性和叛逆色彩。

### Paint It Black歌词：

I see a red door and I want it painted black  
No colors anymore I want them to turn black  
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes  
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars and they're all painted black  
With flowers and my love both never to come back  
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away  
Like a new born baby it just happens every day

I look inside myself and see my heart is black  
I see my red door and must have it painted black  
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts  
It's not easy facin' up when your whole world is black

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue  
I could not foresee this thing happening to you

If I look hard enough into the settin' sun  
My love will laugh with me before the mornin' comes

I see a red door and I want it painted black  
No colours anymore I want them to turn black  
I see the girls go by dressed in their summer clothes  
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

Hmm, hmm, hmm,...

I wanna see it painted, painted black  
Black as night, black as coal  
I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky  
I wanna see it tainted, tainted, tainted, tainted black  
Yeah!

Hmm, hmm, hmm...
