**Rockstar** 是DaBaby与Roddy Ricch一同合作的单曲，收录于《BLAME IT ON BABY》专辑中。

_Rockstar_
是一首热度非常高的trap作品，这首歌的beat是最出彩的地方，干净轻柔，Dababy极致流畅的flow越听越有味道。hook部分的韵脚听来如一声声炸裂的枪声，充满火药味，呼应了词里描述的情境。后半段Roddy
Ricch的verse也为这首歌增色不少。关于PTSD（创伤后应激障碍），他写道自己会一次次在冷汗中醒来，关于女儿，他又暗自矢誓绝不会让任何人伤害她。在唱到这些时，Dababy的声音似乎也柔和了起来，可以说这首歌多少还是展现了他内心细腻的一面。

### Rockstar歌词：

DaBaby：  
Woo woo  
I pull up like  
How you pull up Baby how you pull up  
Oh oh oh  
How you pull up I pull up  
Woo Seth in the kitchen  
Let's go  
Brand new Lamborghini f**k a cop car  
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Have you ever met a real n***a rockstar  
This ain't no guitar b***h this a Glock  
Woo  
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me  
Woo  
You better let me go the day you need me  
Woo  
Soon as you up me on that n***a get to bustin'  
Woo  
And if I ain't enough go get the chop  
It's safe to say I earned it ain't a n***a gave me nothin'  
Yeah yeah yeah  
I'm ready to hop out on a n***a get to bustin'  
Know you heard me say "You play you lay"  
Don't make me push the button  
Full of pain dropped enough tears to fill up a f**kin' bucket  
Goin' for buckets I bought a chopper  
I got a big drum it hold a hundred ain't goin' for nothin'  
I'm ready to air it out on all these n***as I can see 'em runnin'  
Just talked to my mama she hit me on FaceTime  
Just to check up on me and my brother  
I'm really the baby  
She know that her youngest son was always guaranteed to get the money  
Okay let's go  
She know that her baby boy was always guaranteed to get the loot  
She know what I do she know 'fore I run from a n***a  
I'ma pull it out and shoot  
Boom  
PTSD I'm always waking up in cold sweats like I got the flu  
My daughter a G she saw me kill a n***a in front of her  
Before the age of two  
And I'll kill another n***a too  
'Fore I let another n***a do somethin' to you  
Long as you know that don't let nobody tell you different  
Daddy love you  
Yeah yeah  
DaBaby/Roddy Ricch：  
Let's go

You better let me go the day you need me  
Woo  
Soon as you up me on that n***a get to bustin'

And if I ain't enough go get the chop

Roddy Ricch：  
Keep a Glocky when I ride in the Suburban  
'Cause the codeine had a young n***a swervin'  
I got the mop watch me wash 'em like detergent  
And I'm ballin' that's why it's diamonds on my jersey  
Slide on opps' side and flip the block back yeah yeah  
My junior popped him and left him lopsided yeah yeah  
We spin his block got the rebound Dennis Rodman  
Fool me one time you can't cross me again  
Twelve hundred horsepower I get lost in the wind  
If he talkin' on the yard the pen' dogs'll take his chin  
Maybach SUV for my refugees  
Buy blocks in the hood put money in the streets  
I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station  
Had it on me thirty thousand thought it was my last day  
But they ain't even want no smoke  
If I had to choose it murder what she wrote  
DaBaby：  
Let's go  
Brand new Lamborghini f**k a cop car  
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Have you ever met a real n***a rockstar  
This ain't no guitar b***h this a Glock  
Woo  
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me  
Woo  
You better let me go the day you need me  
Woo  
Soon as you up me on that n***a get to bustin'  
Woo  
And if I ain't enough go get the chop
