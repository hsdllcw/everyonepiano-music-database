### The City歌词：

This city never sleeps  
I hear the people walk by when it’s late  
Sirens bleed through my windowsill  
I can’t close my eyes  
Don’t control what I’m into  
And this tower is alive  
The lights that blind keep me awake  
Hood up and lace untied  
The sleep fills my mind  
Can't control what I’m into

London calls me a stranger, a traveller  
This is now my home, my home

I’m burning on the back street  
Stuck here sitting in the backseat  
I’m blazing on the street  
What I do isn’t up to you  
If the city never sleeps  
Then that makes two

The pavement is my friend  
It will take me where I need to go  
I find it trips me up  
And puts me down  
This is not what I’m used to  
The shop across the road  
Fills my needs and gives me company  
When I need it  
Voices speak through my walls  
I don’t think I’m gonna make it  
Past tomorrow

London calls me a stranger, a traveller  
This is now my home, my home

I’m burning on the back street  
Stuck here sitting in the backseat  
I’m blazing on the street  
What I do isn’t up to you  
If the city never sleeps  
Then that makes two

And my lungs hurt  
And my ears bled  
With the sound of the city life  
Echoed in my head  
Do I need this to keep me alive?  
The traffic stops and starts  
But I need to move along

London calls me a stranger  
This is not my home, home

I’m burning on the back street  
Stuck here sitting in the backseat  
I’m blazing on the street  
What I do isn’t up to you  
And if the city never sleeps  
Then that makes two
