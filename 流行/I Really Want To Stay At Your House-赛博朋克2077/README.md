### I Really Want To Stay At Your House歌词：

I couldn't wait for you to come clear the cupboards  
But now you're going to leave with nothing but a sign  
Another evening I'll be sitting reading in between your lines  
Because I miss you all the time  
So get away  
Another way to feel what you didn't want yourself to know  
And let yourself go  
You know you didn't lose your self-control  
Let's start at the rainbow  
Turn away  
Another way to be where you didn't want yourself to go  
Let yourself go  
Is that a compromise  
So what do you wanna do what's your point of view  
There's a party soon do you wanna go  
A handshake with you what's your point of view  
I'm on top of you I don't wanna go  
'Cause I really wanna stay at your house  
And I hope this works out  
But you know how much you broke me apart  
I'm done with you I'm ignoring you  
I don't wanna know ah-  
And I'm aware that you were lying in the gutter  
'Cause I did everything to be there by your side-ide  
So when you tell me I'm the reason I just can't believe the lie-es  
And why do I so want to call you  
Call you call you call you  
So what do you wanna do what's your point of view  
There's a party soon do you wanna go  
A handshake with you what's your point of view  
I'm on top of you I don't wanna go  
'Cause I really wanna stay at your house  
And I hope this works out  
But you know how much you broke me apart  
I'm done with you I'm ignoring you  
I don't wanna know ah-  
Oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
I don't know why I'm no-one  
So get away  
Another way to feel what you didn't want yourself to know  
And let yourself go  
You know you didn't lose your self-control  
Let's start at the rainbow  
Turn away  
Another way to be where you didn't want yourself to go  
Let yourself go  
Is that a compromise  
So what do you wanna do what's your point of view  
There's a party soon do you wanna go  
A handshake with you what's your point of view  
I'm on top of you I don't wanna go  
'Cause I really wanna stay at your house  
And I hope this works out  
But you know how much you broke me apart  
I'm done with you I'm ignoring you  
I don't wanna know ah
