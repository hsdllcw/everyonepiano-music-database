### Right Where You Left Me歌词：

[Verse 1]  
Friends break up, friends get married  
Strangers get born, strangers get buried  
Trends change, rumors fly through new skies  
But I'm right where you left me  
Matches burn after the other  
Pages turn and stick to each other  
Wages earned and lessons learned  
But I'm right where you left me  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Help, I'm still at the restaurant  
Still sitting in a corner I haunt  
Cross-legged in the dim light  
They say, "What a sad sight"  
I, I swear you could hear a hair pin drop  
Right when I felt the moment stop  
Glass shattered on the white cloth  
Everybody moved on, I, I stayed there  
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair  
They expected me to find somewhere  
Some perspective, but I sat and stared  
[Chorus]  
Right where you left me  
You left me no, you left me no  
You left me no choice but to stay here forever  
You left me, you left me no, you left me no  
You left me no choice but to stay here forever  
[Verse 2]  
Did you ever hear about the girl who got frozen?  
Time went on for everybody else  
She won't know it, she's still twenty-three inside her fantasy  
How it was supposed to be  
Did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion?  
Breakups happen every day, you don't have to lose it  
She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy  
And you're sitting in front of me  
[Bridge]  
At the restaurant when I was still the one you want  
Cross-legged in the dim light everything was just right  
I, I could feel the mascara run  
You told me that you met someone  
Glass shattered on the white cloth  
Everybody moved on  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Help, I'm still at the restaurant  
Still sitting in a corner I haunt  
Cross-legged in the dim light  
They say, "What a sad sight"  
I, I stayed there  
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair  
I'm sure that you got a wife out there  
Kids and Christmas, but I'm unaware  
Cause I'm right where I cause no harm  
Mind my business  
If our love died young  
I can't bear witness  
And it's been so long  
But if you ever think you got it wrong  
[Chorus]  
I'm right where  
You left me  
You left me no, you left me no  
You left me no choice but to stay here forever  
You left me  
You left me no, you left me no  
You left me no choice but to stay here forever
