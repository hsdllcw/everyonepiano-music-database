### Arcade歌词：

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh  
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh  
A broken heart is all that's left  
I'm still fixing all the cracks  
Lost a couple of pieces when  
I carried it, carried it, carried it home  
I'm afraid of all I am  
My mind feels like a foreign land  
Silence ringing inside my head  
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home  
I spent all of the love I've saved  
We were always a losing game  
Small-town boy in a big arcade  
I got addicted to a losing game  
Ooh, ooh  
All I know, all I know  
Loving you is a losing game  
How many pennies in the slot?  
Giving us up didn’t take a lot  
I saw the end 'fore it begun  
Still I carried, I carried, I carried on  
Ooh, ooh  
All I know, all I know  
Loving you is a losing game  
Ooh, ooh  
All I know, all I know  
Loving you is a losing game  
I don't need your games, game over  
Get me off this rollercoaster  
Ooh, ooh  
All I know, all I know  
Loving you is a losing game  
Ooh, ooh  
All I know, all I know  
Loving you is a losing game  
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh  
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
