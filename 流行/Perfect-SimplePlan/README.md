Perfect是一支来自加拿大蒙特利尔的流行朋克乐团
SimplePlan的歌曲。乐队歌曲核心部分的突出特点是低沉圆润而抒情，2002年推出首张专辑一炮打响，仅仅一年，他们周游了五大洲，演出300多场，被众多媒体与乐迷誉为流行乐坛的新一代天王，被纽约时报喻为“朋克摇滚复兴”。2011年乐队积蓄三年能量推出的第四张兼具朋克与流行多重音乐元素的专辑《Get
Your Hearts
On》，让他们不但成为加拿大电台票选的年度风云人物，以及2012年法国NRJ电台音乐奖（被誉为法国“格莱美”）最佳年度组合，亦开启了与专辑同名的世界巡演之旅。

  
在2002年，简单计划发布了自己的第一个录音室专辑No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls， 而导致随后的单打：I'm Just a
Kid ， I'd Do Anything ， Addicted和 _Perfect_ 。 简单计划指出的话说，他们是针对一个纯粹的流行朋克纪录。
专辑的名称反映了裁谈会受欢迎的标记线运动的橄榄球， “没有垫子，没有头盔，没有pussies 。 ”

### Perfect歌词：

Hey dad look at me  
Think back and talk to me  
Did I grow up according to plan?  
And do you think I'm wasting my time doing things I wanna do?  
But it hurts when you disapprove all along

And now I try hard to make it  
I just wanna make you proud  
I'm never gonna be good enough for you  
Can't pretend that  
I'm alright  
And you can't change me

'Cause we lost it all  
Nothing lasts forever  
I'm sorry  
I can't be perfect  
Now it's just too late and  
We can't go back  
I'm sorry  
I can't be perfect

I try not to think  
About the pain I feel inside  
Did you know you used to be my hero?  
All the days you spent with me  
Now seem so far away  
And it feels like you don't care anymore

And now I try hard to make it  
I just wanna make you proud  
I'm never gonna be good enough for you  
I can't stand another fight  
And nothing's alright

'Cause we lost it all  
Nothing lasts forever  
I'm sorry  
I can't be perfect  
Now it's just too late and  
We can't go back  
I'm sorry  
I can't be perfect

Nothing's gonna change the things that you said  
Nothing's gonna make this right again (right again)  
Please don't turn your back  
I can't believe it's hard  
Just to talk to you  
But you don't understand (you don't understand)

'Cause we lost it all  
Nothing lasts forever  
I'm sorry  
I can't be perfect  
Now it's just too late and  
We can't go back  
I'm sorry  
I can't be perfect

'Cause we lost it all  
Nothing lasts forever  
I'm sorry  
I can't be perfect  
Now it's just too late and  
We can't go back  
I'm sorry  
I can't be perfect
