### Christmas Without You歌词：

Lights on the trees under fallen snow  
You get a bit closer when winter's cold  
Now I can't wait 'til you're by my side  
All of the best gifts you just can't buy  
Wherever you go you light up the room  
I hope that you'll make it back home soon  
Cuz it won't feel like Christmas without you  
I wish we were kissing under mistletoe  
The stars on the sky just can't match you glow  
Now I can't wait 'til you're by my side  
We'll be warm by the fire all night ohh  
I wanna hold you while the bells are all ringing  
Want you to be here while the angel's singing  
Days are perfect when I got you near  
My only wish is you here  
Wherever you go you light up the room  
I hope that you'll make it back home soon  
Cuz it won't feel like Christmas without you  
Wherever you are you brighten the moon  
I hope that you'll make it back home soon  
Cuz it won't feel like Christmas without you  
Without you  
We could be outside dancing in the moonlight  
Watching the sky roll over our heads  
We could be inside trying to sing the lines right  
Laughing until we fall out of bed  
So when I wake up on Christmas Day  
I hope the first thing I see is your face  
Wherever you go you light up the room  
I hope that you'll make it back home soon  
Cuz it won't feel like Christmas without you  
Wherever you are you brighten the moon  
I hope that you'll make it back home soon  
Cuz it won't feel like Christmas without you  
It won't feel like Christmas without you
