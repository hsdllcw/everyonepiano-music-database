### Can't Pretend歌词：

Love, I have wounds,  
Only you can mend,  
You can mend.  
I guess that's love,  
I can't pretend,  
I can't pretend.

Feel, my skin is rough,  
But it can be cleansed,  
It can be cleansed.  
And my arms are tough,  
But they can be bent,  
They can be bent.

And I wanna fight,  
But I can't contend.  
I guess that's love,  
I can't pretend,  
I can't pretend.

Oh, feel our bodies grow,  
And our souls they blend.  
Yeah love I hope you know,  
How much my heart depends.

But I guess that's love  
I can't pretend,  
I can't pretend.  
I guess that's love  
I can't pretend,  
I can't pretend.

Oh feel our bodies grow,  
And our souls they blend.  
Yeah love I hope you know,  
How much my heart depends.

I guess that's love  
I can't pretend,  
I can't pretend.  
I guess that's love  
I can't pretend,  
I can't pretend.
