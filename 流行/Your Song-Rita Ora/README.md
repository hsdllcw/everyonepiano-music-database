### Your Song歌词：

I woke up with a fear this morning  
But I can taste you on the tip of my tongue  
Alone without no warning  
You're by my side and we've got smoke in our lungs  
Last night we were way up kissing in the back of the cab  
And then you say love baby let's go back to my flat  
And when we wake up never had a feeling like that  
I got a reason so man put that record on again  
I don't want to hear sad songs anymore  
I only want to hear love songs  
I found my heart up in this place tonight  
Don't want to sing mad songs anymore  
Only want to sing your song  
Cause your song's got me feeling like I'm  
I'm in love I'm in love I'm in love  
Yeah you know your song's got me feeling like that  
No fear but I think I'm falling  
I'm not proud  
But I'm usually the type of girl that would hit and run  
No risk so I think I'm all in  
When I kiss your lips through my heartbeat thumb  
And now we're way up dancing on the roof of the house  
And then we make love right there on your best friend's couch  
And then you say love this is what is all about  
So keep on kissing my mouth and put that record on again  
I don't want to hear sad songs anymore  
I only want to hear love songs  
I found my heart up in this place tonight  
Don't want to sing mad songs anymore  
Only want to sing your song  
Cause your song's got me feeling like I'm  
I'm in love I'm in love I'm in love  
I'm in love I'm in love I'm in love  
I'm in love I'm in love I'm in love  
Yeah you know your song's got me feeling like I'm  
I don't want to hear sad songs anymore  
I only want to hear love songs  
I found my heart up in this place tonight  
Don't want to sing mad songs anymore  
Only want to sing your song  
Cause your song's got me feeling like I'm  
I don't want to hear sad songs anymore  
I only want to hear love songs  
I found my heart up in this place tonight  
Don't want to sing mad songs anymore  
Only want to sing your song  
Cause your song's got me feeling like I'm  
I'm in love I'm in love I'm in love  
I'm in love I'm in love I'm in love  
I'm in love I'm in love I'm in love  
Yeah you know your song's got me feeling like that
