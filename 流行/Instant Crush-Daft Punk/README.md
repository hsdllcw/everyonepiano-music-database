### Instant Crush歌词：

I didn't wanna be the one to forget  
I thought of everything I'd never regret  
A little time with you is all that I get  
That's all we need because it's all we can take  
One thing I never see, the same when you 'round  
I don't believe in him - his slips on ground  
I wanna take you to that place near the "Roche"  
But no one gives us any time anymore  
He ask me once if I'd look in on his dog  
You made an offer for it, then you ran off  
I got this picture of us kids in my head  
And all I hear is the last thing that you said  
I listened to your problems, now listen to mine  
I didn't want to anymore  
And we will never be alone again  
Cause it doesn't happen everyday  
Kinda counted on you being a friend  
Can I give it up or give it away?  
Now I thought about what I wanna say  
But I never really know where to go  
So I changed myself to a friend  
Cause I know it unlocks like a door  
And we will never be alone again  
Cause it doesn't happen everyday  
Kinda counted on you being a friend  
Can I give it up or give it away?  
Now I thought about what I wanna say  
But I never really know where to go  
So I changed myself to a friend  
Still one more again  
It didn't matter what they wanted to see  
He thought he saw someone that looked just like me  
The summer memory that just never dies  
We worked too long and hard to give it no time  
He sees right through me, it's so easy with lies  
Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise  
He runs the scissors at the seam in the wall  
He cannot break it down or else he would fall  
One thousand lonely stars hiding in the cold  
Take it, I don't want to sing anymore  
I listened to your problems, now listen to mine  
I didn't want to anymore  
And we will never be alone again  
Cause it doesn't happen everyday  
Kinda counted on you being a friend  
Can I give it up or put it away?  
Now I thought about what I wanna say  
But I never really know where to go  
So I changed myself to a friend  
Cause I know it unlocks like a door...  
And we will never be alone again  
Cause it doesn't happen everyday  
Kinda counted on you being a friend  
Can I give it up or put it away?  
Now I thought about what I wanna say  
But I never really know where to go  
So I changed myself to a friend  
Cause I know it unlocks like a door  
I don't understand, don't get upset, I'm not with you  
We're swimming around, it's all I do when I'm with you  
And we will never be alone again  
Cause it doesn't happen everyday  
Kinda counted on you being a friend  
Can I give it up or give it away?  
Now I thought about what I wanna say  
But I never really know where to go  
So I changed myself to a friend  
Cause I know it unlocks like a door  
And we will never be alone again  
Cause it doesn't happen everyday  
Kinda counted on you being a friend  
Can I give it up or give it away?  
Now I thought about what I wanna say  
But I never really know where to go  
So I changed myself to a friend  
Cause I know it unlocks like a door
