**Middle Child双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Middle Child_ 由 J. Cole 演唱，收录于《Revenge Of The Dreamers
III》专辑中。歌名自喻Cole是夹在新时代和旧时代中间的人。此歌承接上专发表对成瘾性物品的看法并再次提到“Lil辈”艺人，同时Shout
out刚合作完的21、老板Jay-
Z还有即将上法庭的柯达鸭。在谈到Drake的片段时似乎影射了侃爷，但也有说Cole是在表述现今rapper之间的beef事件其实都是在炒热度。

### Middle Child歌词：

You good T-Minus  
N***as been countin' me out  
I'm countin' my bullets I'm loadin' my clips  
I'm writin' down names I'm makin' a list  
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit  
The real ones been dyin' the fake ones is lit  
The game is off balance I'm back on my s**t  
The Bentley is dirty my sneakers is dirty  
But that's how I like it you all on my dick  
I'm all in my bag this hard as it get  
I do not snort powder I might take a sip  
I might hit the blunt but I'm liable to trip  
I ain't poppin' no pill but you do as you wish  
I roll with some fiends I love 'em to death  
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich  
What good is the bread if my n***as is broke  
What good is first class if my n***as can't sit  
That's my next mission that's why I can't quit  
Just like LeBron get my n***as more chips  
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist  
This watch came from Drizzy he gave me a gift  
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss  
They act like two legends cannot coexist  
But I'd never beef with a n***a for nothin'  
If I smoke a rapper it's gon' be legit  
It won't be for clout it won't be for fame  
It won't be 'cause my s**t ain't sellin' the same  
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers  
It won't be 'cause some n***a slid in my lane  
Everything grows it's destined to change  
I love you lil' n***as I'm glad that you came  
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can  
I hope you know money won't erase the pain  
To the OGs I'm thankin' you now  
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground  
I copied your cadence I mirrored your style  
I studied the greats I'm the greatest right now  
F**k if you feel me you ain't got a choice  
Now I ain't do no promo still made all that noise  
This year gon' be different I set my intentions  
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice  
N***as been countin' me out  
I'm countin' my bullets I'm loadin' my clips  
I'm writin' down names I'm makin' a list  
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit  
The real ones been dyin' the fake ones is lit  
The game is off balance I'm back on my s**t  
The Bentley is dirty my sneakers is dirty  
But that's how I like it you all on my dick  
I just poured somethin' in my cup  
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel  
Promise I am never lettin' up  
Money in your palm don't make you real  
Foot is on they neck I got 'em stuck  
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel  
If it ain't 'bout the squad don't give a f**k  
Pistol in your hand don't make you real  
I'm dead in the middle of two generations  
I'm little bro and big bro all at once  
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage  
I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch  
Had a long talk with the young n***a Kodak  
Reminded me of young n***as from 'Ville  
Straight out the projects no fakin' just honest  
I wish that he had more guidance for real  
Too many n***as in cycle of jail  
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell  
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma  
We raised by our mamas Lord we gotta heal  
We hurting our sisters the babies as well  
We killing our brothers they poisoned the well  
Distorted self image we set up to fail  
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail nigga  
I just poured somethin' in my cup  
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel  
Promise I am never lettin' up  
Money in your palm don't make you real  
Foot is on they neck I got 'em stuck  
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel  
If it ain't 'bout the squad don't give a f**k  
Pistol in your hand don't make you real  
Money in your palm don't make you real  
Pistol in your hand don't make you real  
Money in your palm don't make you real
