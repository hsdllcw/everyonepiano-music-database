**Stressed Out** 是美国摇滚乐队Twenty One
Pilots演唱的一首歌曲，由泰勒•约瑟夫完成词曲创作，麦克•埃利桑多担任制作人。歌曲于2015年4月28日作为其第二张厂牌录音室专辑《Blurryface》的第二支单曲发行。

《 _Stressed Out_
》这首歌曲是对伴随成年时期的压力而至的黯淡情感的一种流露。歌曲分别将无忧无虑的童年生活与成年人的压力、树屋的欢乐与学生的债务负担以及向往外太空的童年梦与对个人外表和财富的担忧这三种对立面进行了对比。“过去做着外太空的梦，现在人们只会嘲笑我们说‘醒醒吧，该去挣钱养活自己了。’”，歌词看似戏谑不羁，但传达的同理心却被广大青年人接收并为之共鸣。

### Stressed Out歌词：

I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard,  
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words,  
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new,  
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang,

I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink,  
But now I'm insecure and I care what people think.

My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think.  
My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think.

Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days,  
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out.  
Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days,  
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out.

We're stressed out.

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young,  
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from,  
I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it,  
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one,

It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose,  
Same clothes homegrown a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam,  
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered,  
Out of student loans and treehouse homes we all would take the latter.

My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think.  
My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think.

Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days,  
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out.  
Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days,  
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out.

We used to play pretend, give each other different names,  
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away,  
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face,  
Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money."  
Yo.

We used to play pretend, give each other different names,  
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away,  
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face,  
Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money."  
Yo.

Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days,  
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out.  
Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days,  
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out.

Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, bunny  
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money  
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, bunny  
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money  
We used to play pretend, give each other different names,  
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away,  
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face,  
Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money."  
Yo.
