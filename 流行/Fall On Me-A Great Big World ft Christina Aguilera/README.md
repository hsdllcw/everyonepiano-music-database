**Fall On Me双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

继大热单曲Say Something后，Christina Aguilera和A Great Big World再度合作，为我们献上这首冬日里的真挚暖心作《
_Fall On Me_ 》。

A Great Big World的声音温柔治愈，Christina
Aguilera的高音依然浑厚有力，中音区也非常舒服。值得一提的是，此曲之前曾由意大利歌唱家安德烈•波切利和他的儿子一起献唱过，也曾作为电影《胡桃夹子与四个王国》的插曲，那一版本同样独具韵味，触人心弦。

Something")》曲谱下载

### Fall On Me歌词：

Sooner or later the lights up above  
Will come down in circles and guide me to love  
I don't know what's right for me  
I cannot see straight  
I've been here too long and I don't wanna wait for it  
Fly like a cannonball straight to my soul  
Tear me to pieces and make me feel whole  
I'm willing to fight for it  
To feel something new  
To know what it's like to be sharing a space with you  
Fall on me  
With open arms  
Fall on me  
From where you are  
Fall on me  
With all your light  
With all your light  
With all your light  
Sooner or later it all comes apart  
The walls are all shattered I'm back at the start  
And I'm willing to follow this  
Wherever it goes  
The heart has its reasons that nobody knows  
And I wanna believe in a world we can't see  
Millions of particles passing through me  
And I know there's a meaning  
I feel it I swear  
I can't see the future  
But I know that it's there  
Fall on me  
With open arms  
Fall on me  
From where you are  
Fall on me  
With all your light  
With all your light  
With all your light  
With all your light  
I close my eyes  
And I'm seeing you everywhere  
I step outside  
It's like I'm breathing you in the air  
I can feel you're there  
Fall on me  
With open arms  
Fall on me  
From where you are  
Fall on me  
With all your light  
With all your light  
With all your light  
With all your light
