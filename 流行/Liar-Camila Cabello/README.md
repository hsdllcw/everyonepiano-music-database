### Liar歌词：

I don't care if you're here  
Or if you're not alone  
I don't care it's been too long  
It's kinda like it didn't happen  
The way that your lips move  
They way you whisper soft  
I don't care it's good it's gone  
Uh I said I won't lose control  
I don't want it  
I said I won't get too close  
But I can't stop it  
Oh no there you go  
Making me a liar  
Got me begging you for more  
Oh no there I go  
Start another fire  
Oh no no  
Oh no there you go  
Making me a liar  
I kinda like it though  
Oh no there I go  
Start another fire  
Oh no no  
They're watching I feel it  
I know I shouldn't stay  
I picture your hands on me  
I think I wanna let it happen  
But what if you kiss me  
And what if I like it  
And no one sees it  
I said I won't lose control  
I don't want it  
I said I won't get too close  
But I can't stop it  
Oh no there you go  
Making me a liar  
Got me begging you for more  
Oh no there I go  
Start another fire  
Oh no no  
Oh no there you go  
Making me a liar  
I kinda like it though  
Oh no there I go  
Start another fire  
Oh no no  
Oh no no no  
Here comes trouble no no  
Start another fire  
I don't believe myself when I  
Say that I don't need you  
I don't believe myself when I  
Say it so don't believe me  
Oh no there you go  
Making me a liar  
Got me begging you for more  
Oh no there I go  
Start another fire  
Oh no no  
Oh no there you go  
Making me a liar  
I kinda like it though  
Oh no there I go  
Start another fire  
Oh no no  
Oh no no no  
Oh no no no  
Oh no you're making me a liar  
'Cause your clothes on the floor  
Another fire
