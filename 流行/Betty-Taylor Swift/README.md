**Betty** 是由美国女歌手Taylor Swift创作的一首歌曲，被收录在Taylor
Swift于2020年7月24日发行的第八张录音室专辑《Folklore》，为其所属专辑中的第14首歌曲。

《Folklore》是一张突破Taylor固有风格的专辑，她的声音变得冷静而节制，不再有之前汹涌的控诉和骄傲的自信，多的是于无声处听惊雷的力量，她仿佛卸下了束缚和愤怒，转而陷入思索。隔离生活让Taylor在该专辑中变得比以往更加温柔，甚至有些忧伤，她重拾她拿手的风格，用简单的音乐形式将一个个故事娓娓道来。

### Betty歌词：

Betty I won't make assumptions about  
Why you switched your homeroom  
But I think it's cause of me  
Betty one time I was riding on my skateboard  
When I passed your house  
It's like I couldn't breathe  
You heard the rumors from Inez  
You can't believe a word she says  
Most times but this time it was true  
The worst thing that I ever did  
Was what I did to you  
But if I just showed up at your party  
Would you have me  
Would you want me  
Would you tell me to go straight to hell  
Or lead me to the garden  
In the garden would you trust me  
If I told you it was just a summer thing  
I'm only seventeen  
I don't know anything  
But I know I miss you  
Betty I know where it all went wrong your favorite song  
Was playing from the far side of the gym  
I was nowhere to be found  
I hate the crowds  
You know that  
Plus I saw you dance with him  
You heard the rumors from Inez  
You can't believe a word she says  
Most times but this time it was true  
The worst thing that I ever did  
Was what I did to you  
But if I just showed up at your party  
Would you have me  
Would you want me  
Would you tell me to go straight to hell  
Or lead me to the garden  
In the garden would you trust me  
If I told you it was just a summer thing  
I'm only seventeen  
I don't know anything  
But I know I miss you  
I was walking home on broken cobblestones  
Just thinking of you  
When she pulled up  
Like a figment of my worst intentions  
She said James get in let's drive  
Those days turned into nights  
Slept next to her but  
I dreamt of you all summer long  
Betty I'm here on your doorstep  
And I planned it out for weeks now  
But it's finally sinking in  
Betty right now is the last time  
I can dream about what happens when you see my face again  
The only thing I wanna do  
Is make it up to you  
So I showed up at your party  
Yeah I showed up at your party  
Yeah I showed up at your party  
Will you have me  
Will you love me  
Will you kiss me on the porch in front of all your stupid friends  
If you kiss me  
Will it be just like I dreamed it  
Will it patch your broken wings  
I'm only seventeen  
I don't know anything  
But I know I miss you  
Standing in your cardigan  
Kissing in my car again  
Stopped at a streetlight  
You know I miss you
