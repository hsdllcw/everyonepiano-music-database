### You Can Leave Your Hat On歌词：

Baby take off your coat  
Real slow  
And take off your shoes  
I'll take off your shoes  
Baby take off your dress  
Yes yes yes  
You can leave your hat on  
You can leave your hat on  
You can leave your hat on  
Go on over there  
Turn on the light  
No all the lights  
Come over here  
Stand on this chair  
That's right  
Raise your arms up into the air  
Now shake 'em  
You give me a reason to live  
You give me a reason to live  
You give me a reason to live  
You give me a reason to live  
Sweet darling  
You can leave your hat on  
You can leave your hat on  
Feeling  
You can leave your hat on  
You can leave your hat on  
You can leave your hat on  
You can leave your hat on  
Suspicious minds a talkin'  
Try'n' to tear us apart  
They don't believe  
In this love of mine  
They don't know I love you  
They don't know what love is  
They don't know what love is  
They don't know what love is  
I know what love is  
Sweet darling  
You can leave your hat on  
You can leave your hat on  
Feeling  
You can leave your hat on  
You can leave your hat on You can leave your hat on You can leave your hat on
