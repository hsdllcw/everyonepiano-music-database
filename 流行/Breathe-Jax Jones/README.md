### Breathe歌词：

Dum-dum-da-da-da-da dum-dum-da-da-da  
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da dum-dum  
What you what you gon' do  
You're my discretional sin  
I feel you on me when I touch my skin  
You got me hooked and you ain't let me in  
And I look in your eyes I'm on the edge  
You're on my mind like a song that I can't escape  
I don't know how many da-da-dums I can take  
I need to know if you're feeling feeling the same  
Is it too late  
But now it's hard to breathe  
I'm not in love it's just a game we do  
I tell myself I'm not that into you  
But I don't wanna sleep it's quarter after 3  
You're in my head like  
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da dum-dum-da-da-da  
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da dum-dum-da-da-da  
You're in my head like  
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da dum-dum-da-da-da  
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da dum-dum-da-da-da  
You're my obsession my truth  
I call my lifeline whenever I'm with you  
And now I dialed your number again  
And you come over and over and then  
You're on my mind like a song that I can't escape  
I don't know how many da-da-dums I can take  
I need to know if you're feeling feeling the same  
Is it too late  
But now it's hard to breathe  
I'm not in love it's just a game we do  
I tell myself I'm not that into you  
But I don't wanna sleep it's quarter after 3  
And now it's hard to breathe  
I'm not in love it's just a thing we make  
We're skin on skin I need this spell to break  
But I don't wanna go and I know that you know  
You're in my head like  
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da dum-dum-da-da-da  
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da dum-dum-da-da-da  
You're in my head like  
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da dum-dum-da-da-da  
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da  
And now it's hard to breathe thing we make  
Breathe thing we do  
Breathe thing we make  
Breathe  
And now it's hard to breathe thing we make  
Breathe thing we do  
Breathe thing we make  
I know it's hard to breathe  
I'm not in love it's just a game we do  
I tell myself I'm not that into you  
But I don't wanna sleep it's quarter after 3  
I know it's hard to breathe  
I'm not in love it's just a thing we make  
Oh we're skin on skin I need to this spell to break  
But I don't wanna go and I know that you know  
You're in my head like  
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da dum-dum-da-da-da  
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da dum-dum-da-da-da  
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da dum-dum-da-da-da  
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da dum-dum-da-da-da
