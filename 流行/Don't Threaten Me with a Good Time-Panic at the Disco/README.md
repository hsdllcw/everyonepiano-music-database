**Don't Threaten Me with a Good Time双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Don't Threaten Me with a Good Time_ 是美国摇滚乐队Panic! at the
Disco的歌曲。收录在其第五张录音室专辑Death of a Bachelor中。Panic! At The
Disco这名字看来有点古怪。根据他们的解释，"Panic"一字是引自加洲奥兰治县(The O.C.!!)乐队Name Taken中的一句歌词，以及The
Smiths的同名歌曲而作成的。虽然他们没有对At The Disco作任何注解，但是凭着这个字根，你也可以想象他们的音乐类型了。

### Don't Threaten Me with a Good Time歌词：

Alright, alright  
Alright, alright  
Alright, alright, it's a hell of a feeling though  
It's a hell of a feeling though  
Alright, alright, it's a hell of a feeling though  
It's a hell of a feeling though

Who are these people?  
I just woke up in my underwear  
No liquor left on the shelf  
I should probably introduce myself  
You shoulda seen what I wore  
I had a cane and a party hat  
I was the king of this hologram  
Where there's no such thing as getting out of hand  
Memories tend to just pop up  
Drunk pre-meds and some rubber gloves  
Five-thousand people with designer drugs  
Don't think I'll ever get enough  
(Don't think I'll ever get enough!)

Champagne, cocaine, gasoline  
And most things in between  
I roam the city in a shopping cart  
A pack of camels and a smoke alarm

This night is heating up  
Raise hell and turn it up  
Saying, "If you go out you might pass out in a drain pipe."  
Oh, yeah  
Don't threaten me with a good time

It's a hell of a feeling though  
It's a hell of a feeling though  
Alright, alright  
It's a hell of a feeling though  
It's a hell of a feeling though

What are these footprints?  
They don't look very human like  
Now I wish that I could find my clothes  
Bedsheets and a morning rose  
I wanna wake up  
Can't even tell if this is a dream  
How did we end up in my neighbors pool  
Upside down with a perfect view?  
Bar to bar at the speed of sound  
Fancy feet dancing through this town  
Lost my mind in a wedding gown  
Don't think I'll ever get it now  
(don't think I'll ever get it now)

Champagne, cocaine, gasoline  
And most things in between  
I roam the city in a shopping cart  
A pack of camels and a smoke alarm

This night is heating up  
Raise hell and turn it up  
Saying, "If you go out you might pass out in a drain pipe."  
Oh, yeah  
Don't threaten me with a good time

I'm a scholar and a gentleman  
And I usually don't fall when I try to stand  
I lost a bet to a guy in a Chiffon skirt  
But I make these high heels work  
I've told you time and time again  
I'm not as think as you drunk I am  
And we all fell down  
When the sun came up  
I think we've had enough

Alright, alright, it's a hell of a feeling though  
It's a hell of a feeling though  
Alright, alright it's a hell of a feeling though  
It's a hell of a feeling though

Champagne, cocaine, gasoline  
And most things in between  
I roam the city in a shopping cart  
A pack of camels and a smoke alarm

This night is heating up  
Raise hell and turn it up  
Saying, "If you go out you might pass out in a drain pipe."  
Oh, yeah  
Don't threaten me with a good time
