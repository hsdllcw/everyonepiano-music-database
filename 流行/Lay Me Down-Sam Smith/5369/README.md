### Lay Me Down歌词：

Yes, I do, I believe  
That one day I will be where I was  
Right there, right next to you  
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark  
The moon, the stars are nothing without you

Your touch, your skin,  
Where do I begin?  
No words can explain the way I’m missing you  
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I’m inside  
These tears, they tell their own story

You told me not to cry when you were gone  
[Regular version:] But the feeling’s overwhelming, they're much too strong  
[Acoustic version:] But the feeling’s overwhelming, it's much too strong

Can I lay by your side, next to you, you  
And make sure you’re alright?  
I’ll take care of you,  
And I don’t want to be here if I can’t be with you tonight

I’m reaching out to you  
Can you hear my call? (who's to say you won't hear me?)  
This hurt that I’ve been through  
I’m missing you, missing you like crazy

You told me not to cry when you were gone  
[Regular version:] But the feeling’s overwhelming, they're much too strong  
[Acoustic version:] But the feeling’s overwhelming, it's much too strong

Can I lay by your side, next to you, you  
And make sure you’re alright?  
I’ll take care of you  
And I don’t wanna be here if I can’t be with you tonight

Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side  
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side

Can I lay by your side, next to you, you  
[Acoustic version ends here]  
And make sure you’re alright?  
I’ll take care of you  
And I don’t wanna be here if I can’t be with you tonight
