Lay Me Down歌词：

Yes I do, I believe  
That one day I will be, where I was  
Right there, right next to you  
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark  
The moon, the stars, are nothing without you  
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?  
No words can explain, the way I'm missing you  
The night, this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside  
These tears, they tell their own story  
You told me not to cry when you were gone  
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong  
  
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you  
And make sure you're alright I'll take care of you,  
Now don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight I'm reaching out to
you  
Can you hear my call?  
  
This hurt that I've been through I'm missing you, missing you like crazy,  
You told me not to cry when you were gone  
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong  
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you  
And make sure you're alright I'll take care of you I don't wanna be here if I
can't be with you tonight  
  
Lay me down, lay me down,  
Lay me down tonight, lay me down tonight  
Lay me down tonight, lay me down  
Lay me down tonight, lay me down  
  
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you  
And make sure you're alright  
I'll take care of you I don't wanna be here if I can't be with you tonight.
