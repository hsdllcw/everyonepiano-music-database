### Motivation歌词：

I'mma break you off let me be your motivation  
To stay and give it tonight  
Baby turn around let me give you innovation  
Hey  
'Cause I do it so right  
You got that good good baby don't you  
Got that good good baby don't you  
But you leavin' solo  
And you regular d**n and you regular  
I ain't gon' keep keep fightin' for it  
Ain't gon' keep keep fightin' for it  
Coz you know this thing here  
Ain't regular d**n ain't regular  
Fallin' into the bed  
Why will we ever do somethin' instead of  
Fallin' into the bed right now  
I'mma break you off let me be your motivation  
To stay and give it tonight  
Baby turn around let me give you innovation  
Hey  
'Cause I do it so right  
Think about it oooh I think about it  
Think about it oooh take a look at me now  
Hey  
A little motivation alright  
You got a bad one baby don't you  
Got a bad one baby don't you  
And we both know there's no  
One better boy no one better boy  
Too late won't make it I'mma tell 'em  
Get you naked but I won't tell 'em  
'Cause you know that there's no  
One better boy no one better boy  
Fallin' into the bed  
Why will we ever do somethin' instead of  
Fallin' into the bed right now  
Eh right now now
