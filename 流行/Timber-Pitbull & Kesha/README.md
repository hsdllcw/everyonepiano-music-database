### Timber歌词：

It's going down, I'm yelling timber.  
You better move, you better dance  
Let's make a night, you won't remember  
I'll be the one, you won't forget  
The bigger they are, the harder they fall  
This biggity boys are diggity out  
I have 'em like Miley Cyrus, clothes off  
Twerking on a roseton, timber  
Crazy town, booty on, timber  
That's the way we like the war, timber  
I'm sticking it in oil spill  
She say she won't, but I bet she will, timber  
Swing your partner round and round  
End of the night, it's going down  
One more shot, another round  
End of the night, it's going down  
Swing your partner round and round  
End of the night, it's going down  
One more shot, another round  
End of the night, it's going down  
It's going down, I'm yelling timber  
You better move, you better dance  
Let's make a night, you won't remember  
I'll be the one, you won't forget  
It's going down, I'm yelling timber  
You better move, you better dance  
Let's make a night, you won't remember  
I'll be the one, you won't forget  
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane  
No, it's just me, ain't a damn thing changed  
Live in hotels, swing on plane  
Left to say, money ain't a thing  
Club jumping like it going down, bowl it  
Order me another round, homie  
We about to climb, wild, 'cause it's about to go down  
Swing your partner round and round  
End of the night, it's going down  
One more shot, another round  
End of the night, it's going down  
Swing your partner round and round  
End of the night, it's going down  
One more shot, another round  
End of the night, it's going down  
It's going down, I'm yelling timber  
You better move, you better dance  
Let's make a night, you won't remember  
I'll be the one, you won't forget  
It's going down, I'm yelling timber  
You better move, you better dance  
Let's make a night, you won't remember  
I'll be the one, you won't forget
