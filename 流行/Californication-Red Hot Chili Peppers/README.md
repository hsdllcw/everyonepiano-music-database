**Californication** 是美国摇滚乐队Red Hot Chili
Peppers的歌曲，收录在其同名专辑Californication中。此单曲获得MTV音乐奖年度最佳音乐录像带、最佳团体音乐录像带、最佳导演、最佳特效及最佳艺术指导等5项提名。

_Californication_ 的最大意义与乐迷最引颈以待的因素，是JOHN跟乐队做出复合让CHILI
PEPPERS这个最经典的阵容重视。然而Californication并不是扮演着BLOOD SUGAR SEX
MAGIK在多年后的延续篇。相隔了八个年头，在近作里我们听到的是乐队迈向成熟细腻的歌曲创作，构成一张CHILI PEPPERS最旋律化的著作。

### Californication歌词：

Psychic spies from China  
Try to steal your mind's elation  
Little girls from Sweden  
Dream of silver screen quotations  
And if you want these kind of dreams  
It's Californication

It's the edge of the world  
And all of western civilization  
The sun may rise in the East  
At least it settles in the final location  
It's understood that Hollywood  
Sells Californication

Pay your surgeon very well  
To break the spell of aging  
Celebrity skin is this your chin  
Or is that war your waging

[Chorus:]  
First born unicorn  
Hard core soft porn  
Dream of Californication  
Dream of Californication

Marry me girl be my fairy to the world  
Be my very own constellation  
A teenage bride with a baby inside  
Getting high on information  
And buy me a star on the boulevard  
It's Californication

Space may be the final frontier  
But it's made in a Hollywood basement  
Cobain can you hear the spheres  
Singing songs off station to station  
And Alderon's not far away  
It's Californication

Born and raised by those who praise  
Control of population everybody's been there and  
I don't mean on vacation

[Chorus]

Destruction leads to a very rough road  
But it also breeds creation  
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar  
They're just another good vibration  
And tidal waves couldn't save the world  
From Californication

Pay your surgeon very well  
To break the spell of aging  
Sicker than the rest  
There is no test  
But this is what you're craving

[Chorus]
