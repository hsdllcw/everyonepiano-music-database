### Cool Kids歌词：

She sees them walking in a straight line,  
That's not really her style  
And they all got the same heartbeat  
But hers is falling behind.  
Nothing in this world could  
Ever bring them down  
Yeah, they're invincible, and she's just in the background  
And she says  
I wish that I could be like the cool kids  
'Cause all the cool kids, they seem to fit in  
I wish that I could be like the cool kids  
He sees them talking with a big smile  
Like the cool kids  
But they haven't got a clue  
Yeah, they're living the good life  
Can't see what he is going through  
They're driving fast cars  
But they don't know where they're going  
In the fast lane, living life without knowing  
And he says  
I wish that I could be like the cool kids  
'Cause all the cool kids, they seem to fit in  
I wish that I could be like the cool kids  
Like the cool kids  
I wish that I could be like the cool kids  
'Cause all the cool kids, they seem to get it  
I wish that I could be like the cool kids  
Like the cool kids  
And they said  
I wish that I could be like the cool kids  
'Cause all the cool kids, they seem to fit in  
I wish that I could be like the cool kids  
Like the cool kids  
I wish that I could be like the cool kids  
'Cause all the cool kids, they seem to fit in  
I wish that I could be like the cool kids  
Like the cool kids  
I wish that I could be like the cool kids  
'Cause all the cool kids, they seem to get it  
I wish that I could be like the cool kids  
Like the cool kids
