**SOS双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_SOS_ 是已故传奇音乐制作人Avicii的生前遗作，由美国灵魂歌手Aloe
Blacc录唱，单曲于2019年4月11日通过环球唱片公司发行。Avicii像音乐界的“黑客”，他做的电子乐风独树一格。无论是乡村还是爵士，无论是独立还摇滚，Avicii总是能通过“浩室”节拍和电音韵律的融合，让音乐在保持原味的基础上，焕发出另一种动感且层次分明的全新活力。

### SOS歌词：

Can you hear me SOS  
Help me put my mind to rest  
Two times clear again I'm acting low  
A pound of w**d and a bag of blow  
I can feel your love pulling me up from the underground  
I don't need my drugs  
We could be more than just part time lovers  
I can feel your touch picking me up from the underground  
I don't need my drugs  
We could be more than just part time lovers  
We could be more than just part time lovers  
We could be more than just part time lovers  
I get robbed of all my sleep  
As my thoughts begin to bleed  
I'd let go but I don't know how  
I don't know how but I need to now  
I can feel your love pulling me up from the underground  
I don't need my drugs  
We could be more than just part time lovers  
I can feel your touch picking me up from the underground  
I don't need my drugs  
We could be more than just part time lovers  
I can feel your touch picking me up from the underground  
I don't need my drugs  
We could be more than just part time lovers  
We could be  
We could be more than just part time lovers  
More than more than yeah more than lovers  
We could be more than just part time lovers  
Can you hear me SOS  
Help me put my mind to rest
