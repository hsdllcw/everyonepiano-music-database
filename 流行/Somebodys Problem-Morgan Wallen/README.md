### Somebody's Problem歌词：

A 'bama red four-runner pulled into the party  
With a 30-A sticker on the back windshield  
Two-tone tank top slippin' off her shoulder  
Kinda girl when she steps out, the world stands still  
Oh, I know where this is goin'  
I already know it  
She's somebody's problem, somebody's goodbye  
Somebody's last call number that they can't find  
Somebody's best day, somebody's worst night  
Somebody's reason for leavin' on the porch light  
Thinkin' 'bout them tan lines and I'm thinkin' damn, I'd  
Love to drown in them heartbreaker blue eyes  
Shе's somebody's problem and somebody's problеm's  
About to be mine  
About to be mine  
Kinda girl once you've had her, you can't stand to lose her  
Kinda girl where your friends tell you don't leave it up  
Kinda girl that goes from tryin' to just to get her number  
To slidin' through the summer to talkin' 'bout love  
Ooh, I think I'm likin' where it's goin'  
I'd like to try me some of  
Somebody's problem, somebody's goodbye  
Somebody's last call number that they can't find  
Somebody's best day, somebody's worst night  
Somebody's reason for leavin' on the porch light  
Thinkin' 'bout them tan lines and I'm thinkin' damn, I'd  
Love to drown in them heartbreaker blue eyes  
She's somebody's problem and somebody's problem's  
About to be mine  
About to be mine  
Oh, hey baby, don't just keep me wishin'  
Oh, let me get to fixin'  
Somebody's problem, somebody's goodbye  
Somebody's last call number that they can't find  
Somebody's best day, somebody's worst night  
Somebody's reason for leavin' on the porch light  
Thinkin' 'bout them tan lines and I'm thinkin' damn, I'd  
Love to drown in them heartbreaker blue eyes  
She's somebody's problem and somebody's problem's  
About to be mine  
About to be mine  
About to be mine  
About to be mine
