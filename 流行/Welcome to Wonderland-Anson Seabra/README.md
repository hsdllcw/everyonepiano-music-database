### Welcome to Wonderland歌词：

Welcome to wonderland we've got it all  
Potions and pastries that make you grow tall  
Forests and cottages castles and cards that can talk  
Welcome to wonderland look where you're at  
Maddest of hatters the Cheshire Cat  
Magical cabins and lovely white rabbits with clocks  
Dancing through a dream underneath the stars  
Laughing 'til the morning comes  
Everyone that leaves has a heavy heart oh wonderland I love  
Welcome to wonderland I'll be your guide  
Holding your hand under sapphire skies  
Let's go exploring or we could just go for a walk  
Welcome to wonderland where should we go  
There's a tea party along down the road  
Make an appearance and maybe they'll sing us a song  
Dancing through a dream underneath the stars  
Laughing 'til the morning comes  
Everyone that leaves has a heavy heart oh wonderland I love  
Nothing around here is quite as it seems  
Not sure if anything's real or a dream  
And the only thing sure from the start  
Is the song that's inside of your heart  
Don't let it leave  
If this was a dream then at least I've got  
Memories for when morning comes  
Now that I must leave with a heavy heart  
Oh won-derland  
I love
