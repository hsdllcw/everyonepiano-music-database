### Short Kings Anthem歌词：

We packin' diamond pistols  
Uh baby get low 'cause I already am  
Starin' through a skirt like I'm Superman  
My hair at an inch your boy Dapper Dan  
I always look fit I ain't got a cramp  
Cut shorty off 'cause I'm short term  
Controlling my joystick now it's your turn  
I don't listen to a chirp bro that's your bird  
Dude's bent out of shape 'cause they got curved  
I could suck a titty while I'm standing up  
Don't ever f**king tell me I ain't man enough  
Standing 5'8 voice 6'5  
Your whole whip crackin' 'cause we're short guys  
I'm 5 foot something but my bills all paid  
On my tippy-toes from LA to the Bay  
Going off the deep end chill in the shallow  
You don't need your heels girl just bring a towel  
I'm five foot something and I'm royalty  
Short king mama ay  
I'm five foot something and I'm royalty  
Short king mama ay  
And no must be this tall to ride  
I'm a fun-sized super nice guy  
I'm five foot something and I'm royalty  
Short king mama ay shorty  
All my shirt tags say XM  
Five girls sayin' I'm they best friend  
Pants not cuffed they just hemmed  
She all in my hotspot 'cause she tetherin'  
Still stand tall I don't need height  
Using all my words I ain't gotta fight  
The glove only comes off at night  
Give my shirt to her bet it fit right  
Stuntin' in my platform shoes  
I serenade you just built like a flute  
In the airport lounge sippin' free booze  
In economy still got leg room  
I'm 5 foot something but my bills all paid  
On my tippy-toes from LA to the Bay  
Going off the deep end chill in the shallow  
You don't need your heels girl just bring a towel  
I'm five foot something and I'm royalty  
Short king mama ay  
I'm five foot something and I'm royalty  
Short king mama ay  
And I must be this tall to ride  
I'm a fun-sized super nice guy  
I'm five foot something and I'm royalty  
Short king mama ay shorty
