### That's When歌词：

Taylor Swift：  
You said "I know"  
When I said "I need some time need some space  
To think about all of this"  
You watched me go  
And I knew my  
Words were hard to hear  
And harder to ever take back  
And I said "When can I-I-I come back"  
Taylor Swift/Keith Urban：  
And you said that's when  
When I wake up in the morning  
That's when when it's sunny or storming  
Laughing when I'm crying  
And that's when I'll be waiting at the front gate  
That's when when I see your face  
I'll let you in and baby that's when  
Mm mm  
Keith Urban：  
I said "I know"  
When you said "I did you wrong  
Made mistakes  
And put you through all of this"  
Through all of this  
Then through the phone  
Came all your tears  
And I said "Leave those all in our past"  
And you said "When can I come back"  
And I said that's when  
When I wake up in the morning  
That's when when it's sunny or storming  
Laughing when I'm crying  
And that's when I'll be waiting at the front gate  
That's when when I see your face  
I'll let you in and baby that's when"  
And you said "Honestly  
When you were gone  
Did you ever think of me"  
And I said  
"That's when when I woke up in the morning  
That's when it was sunny or storming  
Laughing when I was crying  
And that's when you were waiting at the front gate  
That's when when I saw your face  
You let me in and baby that's when"  
That's when when I wake up in the morning  
That's when when it's sunny or storming  
When I'm laughing when I'm crying  
That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate  
That's when I miss you  
That's when when I see your face  
That's when I want you  
That's when I love you  
That's when
