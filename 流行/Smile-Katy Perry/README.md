夏日幸福清凉来袭，美国流行天后Katy Perry用音乐《 **Smile** 》带给你爱与光明，让你在忧郁的日子里心平气和，以全新的自己面对未来！

Katy曾因事业上的受阻而陷入了抑郁、彷徨的低谷。正是在这个最黑暗的的时期，就像是在迷失的道路中摸索着光明。Katy因此写下这首《 _Smile_
》重拾丢失的微笑与阳光。而将Katy带出低谷的，正是她的韧性，希望和爱。黑暗的尽头一定是光明，大雨的背后一定有彩虹。我始终坚信，爱笑的女孩子，运气一定不会差。

### Smile歌词：

Yeah I'm thankful  
Scratch that baby I'm grateful  
Gotta say it's really been a while  
But now I got back that smile  
Smile  
I'm so thankful  
Scratch that baby I'm grateful  
Now you see me shine from a mile  
Finally got back that smile  
Smile  
Every day Groundhog Day  
Goin' through motions felt so fake  
Not myself not my best  
Felt like I failed the test  
But every tear has been a lesson  
Rejection can be God's protection  
Long hard road to get that redemption  
But no shortcuts to a blessin'  
Yeah I'm thankful  
Scratch that baby I'm grateful  
Gotta say it's really been a while  
But now I got back that smile  
Smile  
I'm so thankful  
Scratch that baby I'm grateful  
Now you see me shine from a mile  
Finally got back that smile  
Smile  
I'm 2.0 remodeled  
Used to be dull now I sparkle  
Had a piece of humble pie  
That ego check saved my life  
Now I got a smile like Lionel Richie  
Big and bright need shades just to see me  
Tryna stay alive just like I'm the Bee Gees  
Oh woah  
A Mona Lisa masterpiece  
Yeah I'm thankful  
Scratch that baby I'm grateful  
Gotta say it's really been a while  
But now I got back that smile  
C'mon smile  
I'm so thankful  
Scratch that baby I'm grateful  
So thankful  
Now you see me shine from a mile  
Finally got back that smile  
Smile  
I'm so thankful  
'Cause I'm finally 'cause I'm finally  
I'm so thankful  
'Cause I'm finally 'cause I'm finally  
Oh  
Yeah I'm thankful  
Scratch that baby I'm grateful  
Gotta say it's really been a while  
But now I got back that smile  
Smile  
I'm so thankful  
Scratch that baby I'm grateful  
Now you see me shine from a mile  
Finally got back that smile  
Smile  
Oh oh  
I'm so grateful  
'Cause I'm finally 'cause I'm finally  
Oh oh  
I'm so grateful  
'Cause I'm finally 'cause I'm finally  
Oh oh
