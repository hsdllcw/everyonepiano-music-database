**Secrets双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Secrets_ 是加拿大创作型歌手The
Weeknd的歌曲，收录在其第三张录音室专辑Starboy中。专辑曲目为18首，发行于2016年11月25日。且发行后，最高在80个国家/地区iTunes下载榜单上登顶。

形式上，是从边缘向主流的转型。专辑里充斥着强烈的跟主流市场接轨的欲望，这集中体现在风格定位上。整体上更加“电气化”以及“舞曲化”，采取这种方式主要意图是进入当下语境。2016年，EDM统领欧美乐坛，纯粹的R&B显得势弱，由此，动用某些跨界变体，也算是睿智的手法。此外，诸如邀请制作人Max
Martin以及同行Daft Punk跟Lana Del
Rey等加入，都是在为贴合市场需求。对于现实生存问题而言，这种“贴合”属于正常。毕竟，面对大众需求，是需要更加关注“适用”。但，这或许就是威肯有所欠缺的地方。

### Secrets歌词：

Everybody here wants you  
My love, my love  
And I know that you want them too  
My love, my love  
I ask you what your heart desires  
My love, my love  
You tell me I'm the only one  
My love, my love  
It's a lie, a lie  
I catch you every time  
In your lust, your lust  
Every time you close your eyes  
I hear the secrets that you keep  
When you're talkin' in your sleep  
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep  
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'  
I hear the secrets that you keep  
When you're talkin' in your sleep  
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep  
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'  
You told me not to worry 'bout  
Those guys, those guys  
You told me that you left it all behind  
Behind  
It's a lie, a lie  
I catch you every time  
In your lust, your lust  
Every time you close your eyes  
I hear the secrets that you keep  
When you're talkin' in your sleep  
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep  
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'  
I hear the secrets that you keep  
When you're talkin' in your sleep  
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep  
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'  
Wipe the lust from your eyes  
I see that you're not mine  
I can see the lust in your eyes  
You can't hide it  
You can't be the one  
I realize, we're divided  
I hear the secrets that you keep  
When you're talkin' in your sleep  
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep  
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'  
I hear the secrets that you keep  
When you're talkin' in your sleep  
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep  
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
