### Hurricane歌词：

The Weeknd：  
See this in 3D all lights out for me  
All lights out for me lightning strikes the beach  
Eighty degrees warm it up for me  
Finally free found the God in me  
And I want you to see I can walk on water  
Thousand miles from shore I can float on the water  
Father hold me close don't let me drown  
I know you won't  
Lil Baby：  
Yeah walkin' on the bridge I threw my sins over the deep end  
Sippin' 'til my stomach hurt this month I done lost three friends  
Early mornin' brainstormin' normally I can't sleep in  
Sometimes I just wanna restart it but it all depends  
If I'ma be that same young hungry **** from West End  
Wrote my hardest wrongs and the crazy part I ain't have no pen  
Maybach interior camе with sheepskin  
Still remember whеn I just had three bands  
Now I'm the one everyone call on 'cause I got deep pants  
Bro told me to wait to beat the game it's only defense and  
Never fazed by names that they might call me but they gon' respect  
And I feel like you better off tryin' to call  
I might not get the message  
She just tried to run off with my heart  
But I blocked off the exit yeah  
The Weeknd/KayCyy：  
Oh-oh I know you won't  
I know you won't  
I know you won't  
I know you won't  
I know that you look over us  
I know  
So we silently sleep  
Bring down the rain yeah oh  
Kanye West：  
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm I was out for self  
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm I was up for sale but I couldn't tell  
God made it rain the devil made it hail  
Dropped out of school but I'm that one at Yale  
Made the best tracks and still went off the rail  
Had to go down down down this the new town town town  
This the new ten ten ten I'm goin' in in in  
Here I go on a new trip here I go actin' too lit  
Here I go actin' too rich here I go with a new chick  
And I know what the truth is still playin' after two kids  
It's a lot to digest when your life always movin'  
Architectural Digest but I needed home improvement  
Sixty-million-dollar home never went home to it  
Genius gone clueless it's a whole lot to risk  
Alcohol anonymous who's the busiest loser  
Heated by the rumors read into it too much  
Fiendin' for some true love ask Kim "What do you love"  
Hard to find what the truth is but the truth was that the truth suck  
Always seem to do stuff but this time it was too much  
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm everybody so judgemental  
Everybody so judgemental  
Everybody hurts but I don't judge rentals  
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm it was all so simple  
The Weeknd：  
I see you in 3D the dawn is bright for me  
No more dark for me I know you're watchin' me  
Eighty degrees burnin' up the leaves  
Finally I'm free finally I'm free  
As I go out to sea I can walk on water  
Won't you shine your light  
Demons stuck on my shoulder  
Father hold me close don't let me drown  
I know you won't
