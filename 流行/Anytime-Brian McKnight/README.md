### Anytime歌词：

I can't remember why we fell apart  
From something that was so meant to be.  
Forever was the promise in our hearts.  
Now more and more, I wonder where you are.

Do I ever cross your mind anytime?  
Do you ever wake up reachin out for me?  
Do I ever cross your mind anytime?  
I miss you...

Still have your picture in a frame.  
Hear your footsteps down the hall.  
I swear, I hear your voice driving me insane.  
How I wish that you would call to say  
Do I ever cross your mind anytime?  
Do you ever wake up reachin out for me?  
Do I ever cross your mind anytime?  
I miss you...  
I miss you...  
I miss you...

(Oh, no more)  
Loneliness and heartache.  
(No more)  
Cryin myself to sleep  
(Oh, no more)  
Wondering about tomorrow,  
Won't you come back to me, come back to me.  
(Oh)  
Do I ever cross your mind anytime?  
Do I ever cross your mind anytime?  
Do you ever wake up reachin out for me?  
Do you ever wake up reachin out for me?  
Do I ever cross your mind anytime?  
Do I ever cross your mind anytime?  
I miss you...  
I miss you...  
I miss you....I miss you...
