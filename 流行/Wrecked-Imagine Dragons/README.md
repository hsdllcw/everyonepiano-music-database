**Wrecked** 是美国独立摇滚乐队Imagine Dragons的单曲，收录在其第五张录音室专辑Mercury – Act 1中，发行于2021年。

《 _Wrecked_ 》是梦龙继Next to Me 和Follow U
的又一首情歌，歌曲讲述了在爱人离开后，试图放下这段感情，却发现离开她后，自己的心已经残破不堪，脑海中全是她的一颦一笑、一举一动。主唱Dan
Reynolds低沉的声音中透着绝望与无奈，副歌部分一声声嘶吼似乎在挽留那位Love
one，企图再见她一面，但已经太晚。这首歌与Origins相比，少了很多电子元素，显得更加朴素纯真，Dan Reynolds的温柔一面也体现得淋漓尽致。

### Wrecked歌词：

Days pass by and my eyes stay dry and I think that I'm okay  
'Til I find myself in conversation fading away  
The way you smile the way you walk  
The time you took to teach me all that you had taught  
Tell me how am I supposed to move on  
These days I'm becoming everything that I hate  
Wishing you were around but now it's too late  
My mind is a place that I can't escape your ghost  
Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away  
One more rainy day without you  
Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day  
One more rainy day  
Oh I'm a wreck without you here  
Yeah I'm a wreck since you've been gone  
I've tried to put this all behind me  
I think I was wrecked all along  
Yeah I'm a wreck  
They say that the time will heal and the pain will go away  
But everything it reminds me of you and it comes in waves  
The way you laugh and your shoulders shook  
The time you took to teach me all that you had taught  
Tell me how am I supposed to move on  
These days I'm becoming everything that I hate  
Wishing you were around but now it's too late  
My mind is a place that I can't escape your ghost  
Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away  
One more rainy day without you  
Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day  
One more rainy day  
Oh I'm a wreck without you here  
Yeah I'm a wreck since you've been gone  
I've tried to put this all behind me  
I think I was wrecked all along  
These days when I'm on the brink of the edge  
I remember the words that you said  
"Remember the life you led"  
You'd say "Oh suck it all up don't get stuck in the mud  
Thinking of things that you should have done"  
I'll see you again my loved one  
I'll see you again my loved one  
Yeah I'm a wreck  
I'll see you again my loved one  
Yeah I'm a wreck without you here  
(I'm a wreck without you here loved one)  
Yeah I'm a wreck since you been gone  
(I'm a wreck since you've been gone)  
I've tried to put this all behind me  
I think I was wrecked  
I'm a wreck  
All along  
Yeah I'm a wreck  
Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away  
But I can't  
One more rainy day without you  
Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day  
But I can't  
One more rainy day
