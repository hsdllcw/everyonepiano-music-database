### The Ocean歌词：

You can be my guided light  
Keep me, company in the night  
That's all I need, all I want  
Is for you to stay a little longer now  
With arms around me, like a border  
Like the air I breathe, I let you in  
Keep me warm underneath my skin  
Cause I'm  
Giving in to your touch  
I can never get enough  
Diving deep into the ocean  
To the ocean  
You can be my guided light  
Keep me, company in the night  
That's all I need, all I want  
Is for you to stay a little longer now  
With arms around me, like a border  
Like and endless stream  
You take me in  
To a place that I've never been  
Now I'm  
Giving in to your touch  
I will never get enough  
Diving deep into the ocean  
You can be my guided light  
Keep me, company in the night  
That's all I need, all I want  
Is for you to stay a little longer now  
With arms around me, like a border  
The ocean  
You can be my guided light  
Keep me, company in the night  
That's all I need, all I want  
Is for you to stay a little longer now  
With arms around me, like a border
