### Kiss And Make Up歌词：

Dua Lipa：  
We haven't talked all morning  
Bang my head bang my head against the wall  
I'm scared I'm falling  
Losing all losing all my control  
And I'm tired of talking  
Feel myself saying the same old things  
But this love's important  
Don't wanna lose don't wanna lose you this way  
Dua Lipa/Rosé：  
I I I I I I I I I  
Feel like we about to break up  
I I I I I I I I I  
Just wanna kiss and make up one last time  
Dua Lipa：  
Touch me like you touch nobody  
Put your hands all up on me  
Tired of hearing sorry  
Kiss and make kiss kiss and make up  
How about we leave this party  
'Cause all I want is you up on me  
Tired of hearing sorry  
Kiss and make kiss kiss and make up  
Kiss kiss and make up  
Kiss and make kiss kiss and make up  
Kiss kiss and make up  
Kiss and make kiss kiss and make up  
Jennie/Jisoo：  
아직 너를 못 떠나고  
뭘하고 있는건지  
언젠가는 다 끝날걸  
변난걸 알지만  
고장난 우릴  
다시 고쳐볼 수는 없을지  
아무런 말도 넌 하지마  
마지막은 없어  
Lisa/Rosé：  
I I I I I I I I I  
Feel like we about to break up  
I I I I I I I I I  
Just wanna kiss and make up one last time  
Rosé/Lisa/Jennie：  
Touch me like you touch nobody  
Put your hands all up on me  
Tired of hearing sorry  
Kiss and make kiss kiss and make up  
How about we leave this party  
'Cause all I want is you up on me  
Tired of hearing sorry  
Kiss and make kiss kiss and make up  
Kiss kiss and make up  
Kiss and make kiss kiss and make up  
Kiss kiss and make up  
Kiss and make kiss kiss and make up  
Dua Lipa/Jisoo/Rosé：  
그게 뭐가 되었건  
다 필요없어  
너면 됐어  
So tell me can we work this whole thing out  
Work this whole thing out  
날 처음 만났던 설례는 순간  
그때 처럼  
So tell me can we work this whole thing out  
Work this whole thing out  
Kiss kiss and make up  
Dua Lipa/Rosé/Lisa/Jennie：

Put your hands all up on me

How about we leave this party  
'Cause all I want is you up on me  
Tired of hearing sorry  
Kiss and make kiss kiss and make up  
Kiss kiss and make up  
Kiss and make kiss kiss and make up  
Kiss kiss and make up
