### Hope Is a Dangerous Thing for a Woman Like Me to Have – but I Have It歌词：

I was reading Slim Aarons and I got to thinking that I thought  
Maybe I'd get less stressed if I was tested less like  
All of these debutantes  
Smiling for miles in pink dresses and high heels on white yachts  
But I'm not baby I'm not  
No I'm not that I'm not  
I've been tearing around in my f**king nightgown  
24/7 Sylvia Plath  
Writing in blood on my walls  
'Cause the ink in my pen don't work in my notepad  
Don't ask if I'm happy you know that I'm not  
But at best I can say I'm not sad  
'Cause hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have  
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have  
I had fifteen-year dances  
Church basement romances yeah I've got  
Spilling my guts with the Bowery Bums  
Is the only love I've ever known  
Except for the stage which I also call home when I'm not  
Servin' up God in a burnt coffee pot for the triad  
Hello it's the most famous woman you know on the iPad  
Calling from beyond the grave I just wanna say "Hi Dad"  
I've been tearing up town in my f**king white gown  
Like a godd**n near sociopath  
Shaking my a*s is the only thing that's  
Got this black narcissist off my back  
She couldn't care less and I never cared more  
So there's no more to say about that  
Except hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have  
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman with my past  
There's a new revolution a loud evolution that I saw  
Born of confusion and quiet collusion of which mostly I've known  
A modern day woman with a weak constitution 'cause I've got  
Monsters still under my bed that I could never fight off  
A gatekeeper carelessly dropping the keys on my nights off  
I've been tearing around in my f**king nightgown  
24/7 Sylvia Plath  
Writing in blood on your walls  
'Cause the ink in my pen don't look good in my pad  
They write that I'm happy they know that I'm not  
But at best you can see I'm not sad  
But hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have  
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have  
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have  
But I have it  
Yeah I have it  
Yeah I have it  
I have
