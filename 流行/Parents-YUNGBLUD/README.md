### Parents歌词：

I was born in a messed up century  
My favourite flavoured sweets are raspberry amphetamines  
I bought a car Beretta age sixteen  
I brush my teeth with bleach 'cause I ain't got time for cavities  
My daddy put a gun to my head  
Said if you kiss a boy I'm gonna shoot you dead  
So I tied him up with gaffa tape  
And I locked him in a shed  
Then I went out to the garden  
And I f**ked my best friend 'cause my  
High hopes are getting low  
Because these people are so old  
The way they think about it all  
If I tried I would never know  
My high hopes are getting low  
But I know I'll never be alone  
It's alright we'll survive  
Cause parents ain't always right  
Put a toaster in my bath watch my mum and dad laugh  
See a thousand volts go through the son they wish they never had  
They told me casual affection leads to sexual infection  
But it's hard to get an erection when you're so used to rejection  
Yeah the teacher f**ked the preacher  
Then he had to leave her  
Had to wash away the sins  
Of a male cheerleader  
Hi nice to meet ya got nothing to believe in  
So let me know when my breathing stops  
Cause my  
High hopes are getting low  
Because these people are so old  
The way they think about it all  
If I tried I would never know  
My high hopes are getting low  
But I know I'll never be alone  
It's alright we'll survive  
Cause parents ain't always right  
Tick tock stop the clock  
Because I got the feeling that I'm gonna get shot  
Tick tock stop the clock  
Because I got the feeling that I'm gonna get shot  
My high hopes are getting low  
Because these people are so old  
The way they think about it all  
If I tried I would never know  
My high hopes are getting low  
But I know I'll never be alone  
It's alright we'll survive  
Cause parents ain't always right
