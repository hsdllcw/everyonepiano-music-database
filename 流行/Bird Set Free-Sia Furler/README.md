_Bird Set Free_ 是澳大利亚流行女歌手Sia Furler的歌曲，收录于即将于2016年发行的专辑This Is
Acting中。其慵懒沙哑的声线，独特的咬字，以及非凡的唱功给人们留下了深刻的印象。甚至还有乐评将她的歌声与英国电子民谣天后Dido的放在一起比较，形容为“你不能错过的年度最酷的Down-
Tempo人声”。对于清新民谣风格，她加入了属于她个人的音乐色彩，一种散发着淡淡忧郁气息的魔力，并将此刻划成带有她个人私密情感印记的音乐标签。

### Bird Set Free歌词：

Clipped wings, I was a broken thing  
Had a voice, had a voice but I could not sing  
You would wind me down  
I struggled on the ground  
So lost, the line had been crossed  
Had a voice, had a voice but I could not talk  
You held me down  
I struggle to fly now

But there's a scream inside that we all try to hide  
We hold on so tight, we cannot deny  
Eats us alive, oh it eats us alive  
Yes, there's a scream inside that we all try to hide  
We hold on so tight, but I don't wanna die, no  
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die

And I don't care if I sing off key  
I find myself in my melodies  
I sing for love, I sing for me  
I shout it out like a bird set free  
No I don't care if I sing off key  
I find myself in my melodies  
I sing for love, I sing for me  
I'll shout it out like a bird set free  
I'll shout it out like a bird set free  
I'll shout it out like a bird set free

Now I fly, hit the high notes  
I have a voice, have a voice, hear me roar tonight  
You held me down  
But I fought back loud

But there's a scream inside that we all try to hide  
We hold on so tight, we cannot deny  
Eats us alive, oh it eats us alive  
Yes, there's a scream inside that we all try to hide  
We hold on so tight, but I don't wanna die, no  
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die

And I don't care if I sing off key  
I find myself in my melodies  
I sing for love, I sing for me  
I shout it out like a bird set free  
No I don't care if I sing off key  
I find myself in my melodies  
I sing for love, I sing for me  
I'll shout it out like a bird set free  
I'll shout it out like a bird set free  
I'll shout it out like a bird set free  
I'll shout it out like a bird set free  
I'll shout it out like a bird set free  
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
