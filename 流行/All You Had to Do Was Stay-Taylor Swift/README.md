### All You Had to Do Was Stay歌词：

People like you always want back the love they gave away.  
你这样的人总是想挽回过去丢弃的爱情  
And people like me wanna believe you when you say you’ve changed.  
我这样的人总是在你说你说你会改的时候一而再三的相信你  
The more I think about it now the less I know.  
想的越多，发觉我懂得越少  
All I know is that you drove us off the road.  
我只知道是你将我扔在马路上  
Stay  
留下来吧  
Hey, all you had to do was stay  
嘿，只要你留下来  
Put me in the palm of your hand  
将我捧在你的手心  
Then, why you had to go and lock me out when Iet you in  
然后，为什么你在我对你打开心扉的时候，将我丢在门外，离开我  
Stay, hey, now you say you want it back  
留下来吧，嘿，如今你说你想和好  
But now that it’s just too late  
但是如今一切都太迟了  
Well could’ve been easy  
曾经一切都那么的简单  
All you had to do was stay  
只要你肯留下来  
All you had to do was stay  
只要你不离开我  
All you had to do was stay  
只需要你留下来  
All you had to do was stay  
只要你还在身边  
All you had to do was stay  
只要你留下来  
Here you are now, calling me up but I don’t know what to say  
如今，和你电话的时候我已经无话可说了  
I’ve been picking up the pieces of the mess you made  
我已经将被你伤透的心拾了起来  
People like you always want back the love they pushed aside  
你这样的人总是想挽回你曾推向深渊的爱情  
But people like me are gone forever when you say goodbye  
我这样的人在听到你说再见之后就永远不见了  
Stay, hey,all you had to do was stay  
留下来吧，嘿，如今你说你想和好  
Put me in the palm on your hand  
将我捧在你的手心  
Then, why you had to go and lock me out when Iet you in  
然后，为什么你在我对你打开心扉的时候，将我丢在门外，离开我  
Stay, hey, now you say you want it back

Let me remind you this was what you wanted  
让我提醒你，这就是你曾经想要的爱情  
You ended it  
你亲手毁了它  
You were all I wanted  
你曾是我的梦想  
But not like this  
但是如今是过往的烟云了  
Not like this, not like this  
消散了，物是人非  
Oh, all you had to do was stay  
噢，只要你肯留下来  
Hey, all you had to do was stay
