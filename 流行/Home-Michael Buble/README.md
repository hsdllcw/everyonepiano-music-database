### Home歌词：

Another summer day  
Has come and gone away  
In Paris and Rome  
But I wanna go home  
Mmmmmmmm

May be surrounded by  
A million people I  
Still feel all alone  
I just wanna go home  
Oh, I miss you, you know

And I’ve been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you  
Each one a line or two  
“I’m fine baby, how are you?”  
Well I would send them but I know that it’s just not enough  
My words were cold and flat  
And you deserve more than that

Another aeroplane  
Another sunny place  
I’m lucky, I know  
But I wanna go home  
Mmmm, I’ve got to go home

Let me go home  
I’m just too far from where you are  
I wanna come home

And I feel just like I’m living someone else’s life  
It’s like I just stepped outside  
When everything was going right  
And I know just why you could not  
Come along with me  
This was not your dream  
But you always believed in me

Another winter day has come  
And gone away  
In either Paris or Rome  
And I wanna go home  
Let me go home

And I’m surrounded by  
A million people I  
Still feel alone  
And let me go home  
Oh, I miss you, you know

Let me go home  
I’ve had my run  
Baby, I’m done  
I gotta go home  
Let me go home  
It'll all be all right  
I’ll be home tonight  
I’m coming back home
