**The Hills双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_The Hills_ 是The Weeknd演唱的一首歌曲，发行于2015年5月27日，收录于专辑《Beauty Behind the Madness》。

The Weeknd的音乐如同被一层薄雾所笼罩，慢节奏下伴随着隆隆的低音以及孤独的回声，The
Weeknd用假音营造出幽幻的气氛。Weeknd对歌曲的采样在R&B界实属罕见，他在歌曲中加入了许多独立摇滚和朋克的元素，Beach House,
Siouxsie，Banshees以及Aaliyah都是他采样的对象，他常用悲伤的歌词来表达受伤的感觉以及对性、毒品和派对等事物的看法。Hermoine
Hoby将the Weeknd的歌曲形象地形容为为“听觉的慢性麻醉药”。

### The Hills歌词：

Your man on the road, he doing promo  
You said keep our business on the low-low  
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone  
'Cause you look even better than the photos  
I can't find your house, send me the info  
Driving through the gated residential  
Found out I was coming, sent your friends home  
Keep on tryna hide it but your friends know

I only call you when it's half past five  
The only time that I'll be by your side  
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me  
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me  
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah  
I only fuck you when it's half past five  
The only time I'd ever call you mine  
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me  
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me  
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

I'ma let you know and keep it simple  
Tryna keep it up, don't seem so simple  
I just fucked two bitches 'fore I saw you  
You gon' have to do it at my tempo  
Always tryna send me off to rehab  
Drugs start to feeling like it's decaf  
I'm just tryna live life for the moment  
And all these motherfuckers want a real love

I only call you when it's half past five  
The only time that I'll be by your side  
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me  
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me  
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah  
I only fuck you when it's half past five  
The only time I'd ever call you mine  
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me  
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me  
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes  
Who are you to judge, who are you to judge?  
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies  
Only you to trust, only you

I only call you when it's half past five  
The only time that I'll be by your side  
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me  
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me  
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah  
I only fuck you when it's half past five  
The only time I'd ever call you mine  
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me  
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me  
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

What about love? What about love?
