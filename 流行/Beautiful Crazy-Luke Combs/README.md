### Beautiful Crazy歌词：

Her day starts with a coffee  
And ends with a wine  
Takes forever get ready  
So she's never on time for anything  
But she gets that come get me  
That look in her eye  
Well it kinda scares me  
The way that she drives me wild  
But she drives me wild  
Beautiful  
Crazy she can't help but  
Amaze me  
The way that she dances  
Ain't afraid to take chances  
And wears her heart on her sleeve  
Yeah she's crazy  
But her crazy's beautiful to me  
She makes plans for the weekend  
Can't wait to go out  
Till she changes her mind  
Says let's stay on the couch and watch TV  
And she falls asleep  
Beautiful  
Crazy she can't help but  
Amaze me  
The way that she dances  
Ain't afraid to take chances  
And wears her heart on her sleeve  
Yeah she's crazy  
But her crazy's beautiful to me  
She's unpredictable unforgettable  
It's unusual unbelievable  
How I'm such a fool  
Yeah I'm such a fool for her  
Beautiful  
Crazy she can't help but  
Amaze me  
The way that she dances  
Ain't afraid to take chances  
And wears her heart on her sleeve  
Yeah she's crazy  
She's crazy  
She's crazy  
But her crazy's beautiful to me  
Her crazy's beautiful to me
