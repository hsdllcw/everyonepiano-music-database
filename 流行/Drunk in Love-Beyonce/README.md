### Drunk in Love歌词：

I’ve been drinkin’  
I’ve been drinkin’  
I get filthy when that liquor get into me  
I’ve been thinkin’  
I’ve been thinkin’  
Why can’t I keep my fingers off it, baby I want you, na-nah  
Why can’t I keep my fingers off it, baby I want you, na-nah  
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice  
Feelin’ like an animal with these cameras all in my grill  
Flashing lights, flashing lights  
You got me faded, faded, faded  
Baby I want you, na-nah  
Can’t keep your eyes off of my fatty  
Daddy I want you, na-nah  
Drunk in love  
I want you  
We woke up in the kitchen saying how the hell did this sh** happen, oh baby  
Drunk in love  
We be all night  
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grinding up in the club  
Drunk in love  
We be all night, love, love  
We be all night, love, love  
We be all night  
And everythin’ all right  
No complaints from my body so florescent under these lights  
Boy I’m drinkin’  
Park it in my lot 7-11  
I’m rubbing on it, ru-rubbin’ it  
If you scared call that revren  
Boy I’m drinkin’  
Get my brain right  
Armand de brignac gangster wife  
Louie sheets he sweat it out, like wash rags he wear it out  
Boy I’m drinkin’, I’m singin’  
On the mic to my boy toys  
Then I fill the tub up half way then ride it with my surf board, surf board,
surf board  
Grainin’ on that wood, grainin’, grainin’ on that wood  
I’m swervin’ on that, swervin’, swervin’ on that  
Big body been servin’ all this, swerve, surfin’ in all this good, good  
We woke up in the kitchen saying how the hell did this sh** happen, oh baby  
Drunk in love  
We be all night  
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grinding up in the club  
Drunk in love  
We be all night, love, love  
We be all night, love, love  
Rap:  
That d'usse is the sh**  
If I do say so myself  
If I do say so myself  
If I do say so myself  
Stumbled all in the house time to back up all of that mouth  
That you had in the car  
Talking bout you the baddest bit** thus far  
Talking bout you be reppin' that 3rd  
I wanna see all the sh** that I heard  
You know I sling clint eastwood  
I hope that you can handle this curve  
Foreplay in the foyer  
Fu**ed up my warhlol  
Slip the panties right to the side ain't got the time to take draws off  
On site  
Catch a charge I might  
Beat the box up like mike in ’97 I'll bite  
I’m ike, turner, turn up  
Baby no I don’t play  
Now eat the cake anna mae I said eat the cake anna mae  
I'm nice  
For ya’ll to reach these heights  
You gonna need G3  
4, 5, 6 flights sleep tight  
We sex again in tha mornin’ yo breastases is my breakfast  
We goin' in we be all night  
We be all night, love, love  
We be all night, love, love  
I’m never tired, we never tired  
I’ve been sippin’, it’s the only thing that’s been keeping me on fire, we on
fire  
Didn’t mean to spill that liquor all on my attire  
I’ve been drinkin’, watermelon  
I want your body right here  
Daddy I want you right now  
Can’t keep your eyes off my fatty  
Daddy I want you  
We be all night, love, love  
We be all night, love, love
