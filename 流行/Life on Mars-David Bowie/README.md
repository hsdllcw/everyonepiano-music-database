### Life on Mars歌词：

It's a god-awful small affair  
To the girl with the mousy hair  
But her mummy is yelling "No"  
And her daddy has told her to go  
But her friend is nowhere to be seen  
Now she walks  
through her sunken dream  
To the seat with the clearest view  
And she's hooked to the silver screen  
But the film is a saddening bore  
For she's lived it  
ten times or more  
She could spit in the eyes of fools  
As they ask her to focus on

[CHORUS]  
Sailors fighting in the dance hall  
Oh man!  
Look at those cavemen go  
It's the freakiest show  
Take a look at the Lawman  
Beating up the wrong guy  
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know  
He's in the best selling show  
Is there life on Mars?

It's on Amerika's tortured brow  
That Mickey Mouse  
has grown up a cow  
Now the workers  
have struck for fame  
'Cause Lennon's on sale again  
See the mice in their million hordes  
From Ibeza to the Norfolk Broads  
Rule Britannia is out of bounds  
To my mother, my dog, and clowns  
But the film is a saddening bore  
'Cause I wrote it  
ten times or more  
It's about to be writ again  
As I ask you to focus on

[CHORUS]  
Dring-dring-dring......  
[Mind the phone]
