### The Walker歌词：

Ooh, crazy's what they think about me  
Ain't gonna stop cause they tell me so  
Cause 99 miles per hour baby,  
Is how fast that I like to go.  
Can't keep up with my rhythm  
Though they keep trying.  
Too quick for the lines they throw.  
I walk to the sound of my own drum,  
We go, they go, we go, hey yeah yeah yeah  
Oh, here we go  
Feel it in my soul  
Really mean it, mean it, so go  
Gotta feel it,...  
Really mean it, mean it  
I wake up to the city of angels  
To see my name headlining the coast  
They say I'm a walking dreamer, baby  
If I stop they would make the show  
Can't keep up with my rhythm  
Though they keep trying.  
Too quick for the lines they throw.  
I walk to the sound of my own drum,  
We go, they go, we go, hey yeah yeah yeah  
Oh, here we go  
Feel it in my soul  
Really mean it, mean it, so go  
Gotta feel it,...  
Really mean it, mean it  
Oh, here we go  
Feel it in my soul  
Really mean it, mean it, so go  
Gotta feel it,...  
Really mean it, mean it  
Everybody walk  
Everybody walk  
Everybody walk, walk, walk...  
Oh, here we go  
Feel it in my soul  
Really mean it, mean it, so go  
Gotta feel it,...  
Really mean it, mean it  
Oh, here we go  
Feel it in my soul  
Really mean it, mean it, so go  
Gotta feel it,...  
Really mean it, mean it
