### Stars歌词：

If this is home  
Then what do I call where I came from  
I haven't seen the coast for so long  
They got 'em here but they're not the same  
I'll never know  
Know if I left too soon and too young  
The people there who taught me so much  
Did they get old  
Would they know this face  
Oh it would've been selfless if I stayed  
Oh but I'm living here selfish in LA  
There are no stars in the Hills  
But still I find myself reaching for them  
Fighting for thеm  
Dying for them  
Still there arе no stars in the Hills  
Miss dad and mom  
And laughing with my little brothers  
They're the ones who keep me humble  
I'm not there to see them growing up  
Oh it would have been selfless if I stayed  
Oh but I'm living here selfish in LA  
There are no stars in the Hills  
But still I find myself reaching for them  
Fighting for them  
Dying for them  
Still there are no stars in the Hills  
No place like home here in Hollywood  
No place like home here in Hollywood  
No place like home here in Hollywood  
There are no stars in the Hills  
But still I find myself reaching for them  
Fighting for them  
Dying for them  
Knowing they're not real  
There are no stars in the Hills
