### Me and My Broken Heart歌词：

All I need's a little love in my life  
All I need's a little love in the dark  
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start  
Me and my broken heart  
I need a little loving tonight  
Hold me so I'm not falling apart  
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start  
Me and my broken heart  
Yeah...  
Shot gun, aimed at my heart, you got one  
Tear me apart and then some  
How do we call this love  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
I try to run away but your eyes  
Tell me to stay oh why-y  
Why do we call this love  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
It seems like we've been losing control  
Somebody tell me I'm not alone  
When I say  
All I need's a little love in my life  
All I need's a little love in the dark  
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start  
Me and my broken heart  
I need a little loving tonight  
Hold me so I'm not falling apart  
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start  
Me and my broken heart  
Maybe some part of you just hates me  
You pick me up and play me  
How do we call this love?  
One time tell me you need me tonight  
To make it easy, you lie  
And say it's all for love  
It seems like we've been losing control  
Somebody tell me I'm not alone  
When I say  
All I need's a little love in my life  
All I need's a little love in the dark  
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start  
Me and my broken heart  
I need a little loving tonight  
Hold me so I'm not falling apart  
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start  
Me and my broken heart  
Me and my broken  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Me and my broken  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
How do we call this  
It's just me  
It's just me  
It's just me  
Me and my broken heart  
All I need's a little love in my life  
All I need's a little love in the dark  
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start  
Me and my broken heart  
I need a little loving tonight  
Hold me so I'm not falling apart  
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start  
Me and my broken heart
