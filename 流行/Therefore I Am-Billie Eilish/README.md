北京时间2020年11月13日凌晨2点，五次格莱美奖获奖者Billie Eilish的最新单曲《 **Therefore I Am**
》与最新MV同步首发。

歌名出自笛卡尔的我思故我在（I Think, Therefore I
Am），意思是你认为你是我所想的人，但我想我才是。这首曲风和之前的歌完全不同。歌词表达出了Billie的真实人生感受：不用理会那些肤浅的偏见，坚持做我自己就是最棒的。这是一首充满了个性的新歌，传达的是“故我在”的理念。

Future")》曲谱下载

### Therefore I Am歌词：

I'm not your friend or anything  
D**n you think that you're the man  
I think therefore I am  
I'm not your friend or anything  
D**n you think that you're the man  
I think therefore I am  
Stop what the hell are you talking about  
Get my pretty name outta your mouth  
We are not the same with or without  
Don't talk 'bout me like how you might know how I feel  
Top of the world but your world isn't real  
Your world's an ideal  
So go have fun  
I really couldn't care less  
And you can give 'em my best but just know  
I'm not your friend or anything  
D**n you think that you're the man  
I think therefore I am  
I'm not your friend or anything  
D**n you think that you're the man  
I think therefore I am  
I don't want press to put your name next to mine we're on different lines  
So I wanna be nice enough they don't call my bluff  
'Cause I hate to find  
Articles articles articles  
I'd rather you remain unremarkable  
Got a lotta interviews interviews interviews  
When they say your name  
I just act confused  
Did you have fun  
I really couldn't care less  
And you can give 'em my best but just know  
I'm not your friend or anything  
D**n you think that you're the man  
I think therefore I am  
I'm not your friend or anything  
D**n you think that you're the man  
I think therefore I am  
I'm sorry  
I don't think I caught your name  
I'm sorry  
I don't think I caught your name  
I'm not your friend or anything  
I'm not your friend  
D**n you think that you're the man  
They wanna they can try to  
I think therefore I am D**n  
I'm not your friend or anything  
Friend they wanna  
D**n you think that you're the man  
You're the man  
I think therefore I am  
Therefore I am
