### Hold On歌词：

You know you can call me if you need someone  
I'll pick up the pieces if you come undone  
Painting stars up on your ceiling  
Cause you wish that you could find some feeling yeah you  
You know you can call me if you need someone  
I need you to hold on  
Heaven is a place not too far away  
We all know I should be the one to say we all make mistakes  
Take my hand and hold on  
Tell me everything that you need to say  
'Cause I know how it feels to be someone  
Feels to be someone who loses their way  
You're looking for answers in a place unknown  
You need the connection but you can't get close  
Painting stars up on your ceiling  
Cause you wish that you could find some feeling yeah you  
You know you can call me if you need someone  
I need you to hold on  
Heaven is a place not too far away  
We all know I should be the one to say we all make mistakes  
We all make mistakes  
Take my hand and hold on  
Tell me everything that you need to say  
'Cause I know how it feels to be someone  
Feels to be someone who loses their way  
Midnight 'til morning  
Call if you need somebody  
I will be there for you  
I will be there for you  
Midnight 'til morning  
Call if you need somebody  
I will be there for you  
I need you to hold on  
Heaven is a place not too far away  
We all know I should be the one to say we all make mistakes  
We all make mistakes  
Take my hand and hold on  
Tell me everything that you need to say  
'Cause I know how it feels to be someone  
Oh yeah  
Feels to be someone who loses their way  
Midnight 'til morning  
Call if you need somebody  
I will be there for you  
Oh yeah yeah  
Midnight 'til morning  
Call if you need somebody  
I will be there for you
