### POM POM歌词：

Raindrops, star drops  
The clouds won't stop  
My umbrella hangs by the door  
The sky's a hue, the darkest of blue  
Now I swear I've felt this before  
Your scent in the air  
Are you still there?  
When days are long, I sing a song  
A tiny pom rolls around  
A memory, a distant dream  
You'll always stay in my heart  
It's safe inside, you don't have to hide  
In the place we've made just our style  
The worlds we'd find, let's lose track of time  
So, please, won't you stay for a while?  
Your scent in the air  
Are you still there?  
When days are long, I sing a song  
A tiny pom rolls around  
A memory, a distant dream  
You'll always stay in my heart  
When days are long, I sing a song  
A tiny pom rolls around  
A memory, a distant dream  
You'll always stay in my heart  
You'll always stay in my heart  
La-da-da-da, la-da-da  
La, la-da-da, bum, da-da
