### Never Coming Back歌词：

I was in a better place but  
I still wanted to come home to you sober  
Was on my way when  
Everything fell apart  
And I hear all of my friends  
Music in the background  
Too much to say  
Devils in my mind now  
Told you everyday  
You would really love it here  
Now I'm never coming back  
I think you should just leave me here  
'Cause I'm never coming home  
Even though I will miss you babe  
Have the time of your life  
Leave with whoever you want tonight  
'Cause I'm never coming home  
Even though I will miss you babe  
Had a lot to say but  
Now  
I'm all empty down to the bottom  
There's no way I  
Could give you what you want  
And I hear all of my friends  
Music in the background  
Too much to say  
Devils in my mind now  
Told you everyday  
You would really love it here  
Now I'm never coming back  
I think you should just leave me here  
'Cause I'm never coming home  
Even though I will miss you babe  
Have the time of your life  
Leave with whoever you want tonight  
'Cause I'm never coming home  
Even though I will miss you babe  
Even though I will miss you babe  
And I hear all of my friends  
Music in the background  
Too much to say  
Devils in my mind now  
Told you everyday  
You would really love it here  
Now I'm never coming back  
I think you should just leave me here  
'Cause I'm never coming home  
Even though I will miss you babe  
Have the time of your life  
Leave with whoever you want tonight  
'Cause I'm never coming home  
Even though I will miss you babe  
Now I'm never coming back  
Now I'm never coming back  
Even though I will miss you babe  
Now I'm never coming back  
Now I'm never coming back  
Even though I will miss you babe
