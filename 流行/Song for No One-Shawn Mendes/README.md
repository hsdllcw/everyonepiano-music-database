### Song for No One歌词：

I wake up  
A little drunk  
Check my phone  
I'm all alone  
Ten missed calls  
A couple texts  
None of them are who I'm looking for  
Who I'm looking for, yeah  
This is a song for no one  
This is a song for no one  
Get on a plane  
Fly to the most beautiful place you've ever been  
Close my eyes  
Things are better in my dreams  
'Cause I'm with someone  
Someone I adore  
This is a song for no one  
I wrote this song for no one  
Yesterday, I got pretty drunk  
Said some things that I shouldn't of  
Told you that I really love you  
You did not reciprocate those feelings  
But that's okay, I'll be fine anyway  
Oh, yeah  
I wrote this song for no one  
I wrote this song  
Woo, woo, woo, woo  
No, I wrote this song for no one
