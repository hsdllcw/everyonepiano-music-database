### Noise歌词：

Crave the machine  
Revere the screen  
Zoom in for flak and misery  
Bleed some pixels  
Shoot yourself  
Pose for the dead  
Have a near-life experience  
In a hot air matrix  
Now you're a star  
Vain avatar  
Feeding the beast  
In your loud Egoland  
You have become  
Tool of a tool  
Digital ghouls  
Telling you to  
Shut up and dance  
Color a yarn and the crowds will gather  
Noise  
From a sunless world  
Your mirror is black only a copy stares back  
At a slave of brave new world  
Noise  
To decoy the human voice  
Brain insomniac paranoiac  
Endless noise  
Please love me  
See how I bleed  
Please endure  
I have such empathy in me  
Hum noise hum  
Beautifully numb  
Tapping the quiet air  
To have a meaning  
By a carrion  
Sad hologram  
Lost in the maze  
The real and human feel  
Sunset is free  
From this deity  
The Earth has a real voice  
Go out and get in  
I will follow  
Color a yarn and the crowds will gather  
Noise  
From a sunless world  
Your mirror is black only a copy stares back  
At a slave of brave new world  
Noise  
To decoy the human voice  
Brain insomniac paranoiac  
Endless noise  
Feast your eyes on the black mirror  
Feed the beast join the gathering tell a tale  
Feast of fears is drawing nearer  
Feast your eyes on the black mirror  
Feed the beast join the gathering tell a tale  
Feast of fears is drawing nearer  
Beyond the human horizon  
Something terrifying sleeps  
Noise  
From a sunless world  
Your mirror is black only a copy stares back  
At a slave of brave new world  
Noise  
To decoy the human voice  
Brain insomniac paranoiac  
Endless noise  
Endless noise  
Endless noise
