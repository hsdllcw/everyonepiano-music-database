### Hey Ya!歌词：

[Intro]  
One, two, three, uh!

[Verse One - Andre 3000]  
My baby don't mess around  
Because she loves me so  
And this I know for sure.  
Uh, But does she really wanna  
But can't stand to see me  
Walk out the door.  
Don't try to fight the feelin'  
'Cause the thought alone is killing me right now..  
Uh, thank god for mom and dad  
For sticking two together  
'Cause we don't know how...  
UH!

[Chorus:]  
Hey... ya.  
Hey ya.  
Hey... ya.  
Hey ya.  
Hey... ya.  
Hey ya.  
Hey... ya.  
Hey ya.

[Verse Two - Andre 3000]  
You think you've got it  
Oh, you think you've got it  
But got it just don't get it  
'Til there's nothing at all  
We get together  
Oh, we get together  
But separate's always better when there's feelings involved  
If what they say is "Nothing is forever"  
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes  
Then what makes, what makes, what makes love the exception  
So why you, why you  
Why you, why you, why you are we so in denial  
When we know we're not happy here...  
Y'all don't want me here you just wanna dance

[Chorus]  
Hey... ya. (OH OH)  
Hey ya. (OH OH)  
Hey... ya. (Don't want to meet your daddy, OH OH)  
Hey ya. (Just want you in my Caddy OH OH)  
Hey... ya. (OH OH, don't want to meet yo' mama OH OH)  
Hey ya. (Just want to make you cumma OH OH)  
Hey... ya. (I'm, OH OH I'm, OH OH)  
Hey ya. (I'm just being honest OH OH, I'm just being honest)

Alright, alright, alright, alright  
Alright, alright, alright, alright  
Alright, alright,  
OK now ladies (yeah!)  
Now we gon' break this thing down in just a few seconds  
Now don't have me to break this thing down for nothing  
Now I wanna see y'all on your baddest behavior  
Lend me some sugar, I am your neighbor  
Uh!Here we go know...  
Shake it, shake, shake it, shake it (oh oh)  
Shake it, shake it, shake, shake it, shake it, shake it (oh oh)  
Shake it, shake it like a Polaroid Picture, shake it, shake it  
Shh you got to, shake it, shh shake it, shake it, got to shake it  
(Shake it sugar) shake it like a Polaroid Picture

[Verse Three - Andre 3000 (Repeating "Shake it" in background)]  
Now all Beyoncé's and Lucy Liu's  
And baby dolls, get on the floor  
(Get on the floor)  
You know what to do.  
You know what to do.  
You know what to do!

[Chorus]  
Hey... ya. (OH OH)  
Hey ya. (OH OH)  
Hey... ya. (OH OH)
