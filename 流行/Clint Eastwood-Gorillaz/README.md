**Clint Eastwood** 是英国乐队Gorillaz的歌曲，发行于2001年3月。乐队成员：由主唱ChakaKhan、吉他手Noodle、
团长/贝斯手Murdoc、鼓手Russel组成，乐队的音乐风格中加入了新的方式，造型也特特具有性格，甚至连故事也是那么的天马行空，难以想象，十分虚拟，但又让创作者赋予了极其有血有肉的性格特征。

而 _Clint Eastwood_
，用的是某名导演的名字，但音乐与其是毫无关系，二维的动画加上三维的背景，讲的是鼓手臆想出来的怪物和大猩猩出来大拭破坏，NOODLE小妹妹还在当中大显腿脚工夫。

### Clint Eastwood歌词：

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad  
I got sunshine in a bag  
I'm useless, but not for long  
The future is coming on  
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad  
I got sunshine in a bag  
I'm useless, but not for long  
The future is coming on  
It's coming on  
It's coming on  
It's coming on  
Yeah... ha ha!  
Finally someone let me out of my cage  
Now, time for me is nothing cos I'm counting no age  
Now I couldn't be there  
Now you shouldn't be scared  
I'm good at repairs  
And I'm under each snare  
Intangible  
Bet you didn't think so I command you to  
Panoramic view  
Look I'll make it all manageable  
Pick and choose  
Sit and lose  
All you different crews  
Chicks and dudes  
Who you think is really kickin' tunes?  
Picture you gettin' down in a picture tube  
Like you lit the fuse  
You think it's fictional  
Mystical? Maybe  
Spiritual  
Hearable  
What appears in you is a clearer view cos you're too crazy  
Lifeless  
To know the definition for what life is  
Priceless  
For you because I put you on the hype shit  
You like it?  
Gunsmokin' righteous with one token  
Psychic among those  
Possess you with one go  
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad  
I got sunshine in a bag  
I'm useless, but not for long  
The future is coming on  
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad  
I got sunshine in a bag  
I'm useless, but not for long  
The future is coming on  
It's coming on  
It's coming on  
It's coming on  
The essence the basics  
Without it you make it  
Allow me to make this  
Child, like in nature  
Rhythm  
You have it or you don't that's a fallacy  
I'm in them  
Every sprouting tree  
Every child apiece  
Every cloud you see  
You see with your eyes  
I see destruction and demise  
Corruption in disguise  
From this fuckin' enterprise  
Now I'm sucking to your lies  
Through Russ, though not his muscles but the percussion he provides  
with me as a guide  
But y'all can see me now cos you don't see with your eye  
You perceive with your mind  
That's the inner  
So I'm gonna stick around with Russ and be a mentor  
With a few rhymes so mother fuckers  
Remember where the thought is  
I brought all this  
So you can survive when law is lawless  
Feelings, sensations that you thought were dead  
No squealing, remember  
(that it's all in your head)  
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad  
I got sunshine in a bag  
I'm useless, but not for long  
The future is coming on  
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad  
I got sunshine in a bag  
I'm useless, but not for long  
My future is coming on  
It's coming on  
It's coming on  
It's coming on  
It's coming on  
My future is coming on  
It's coming on  
It's coming on  
It's coming on  
It's coming on  
My future is coming on  
It's coming on  
It's coming on  
It's coming on  
It's coming on  
My future is coming on  
It's coming on  
It's coming on  
My future is coming on  
It's coming on  
It's coming on  
My future is coming on  
It's coming on  
It's coming on  
My future
