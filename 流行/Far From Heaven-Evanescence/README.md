### Far From Heaven歌词：

Give me a reason  
Make me whole again  
Wounds should become scars but I'm cracked instead  
Can't risk believing  
That I would stand a chance  
Frozen in the doorway don't wanna leave the past  
One more night  
What I wouldn't give to be with you  
For one more night  
What if I can't see your light anymore  
'Cause I've spent too long in the dark  
And I'm on my knees without shame begging to believe  
But I feel so far from heaven  
Wake up to a new day  
Break my heart again  
Dreaming makes for sweet escape but I can't forget  
I'm back at the edge now  
I never needed you more  
Staring down the emptiness that I can't ignore  
All my life  
Didn't wanna dream I could lose you  
But you just smiled  
What if I can't see your light anymore  
'Cause I've spent too long in the dark  
And I'm on my knees without shame begging to believe  
But I feel so far from heaven  
Is anyone out there Did you give up on us  
Break this silence I'm crushed under love  
I don't wanna lock down but we've lost so much  
Will you forgive me  
If I can't see your light anymore  
'Cause I've spent too long in the dark  
And I'm on my knees without shame begging to believe  
But I feel so far from heaven  
I feel so far
