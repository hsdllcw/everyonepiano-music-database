### Back to You歌词：

I heard a million tales before I came to you  
One after the other said time's the only cure  
When love is forever gone it disappeared like stars at dawn and every road  
That I've been on  
It leads me back to you  
It leads me back to you  
I walked a million miles before I came to you  
Heaven wide above my head  
Sand beneath my shoes  
Life is the saddest song it was nothing until you came along  
Cuz every road that I've been on leads me back to you  
It leads me back to you  
It leads me back to you  
I sold a million lines before I came to you  
Guess none of us could read the lie behind the golden truth  
Trust can't be counted on  
It's as crooked as the amazon  
Cuz every road that I've been on  
Leads me back to you  
It leads me back to you  
I've been looking for trouble trouble  
I've been looking for trouble trouble  
I've been looking for trouble trouble  
I'm looking for you  
I walked a million miles before I came to you  
Heaven wide above my head  
Sand beneath my shoes  
Life is the saddest song it was nothing until you came along  
Cuz every road that I've been on leads me back to you  
It leads me back to you  
It leads me back to you  
Every road that I've been on leads me back to you
