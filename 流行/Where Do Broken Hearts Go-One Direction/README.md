### Where Do Broken Hearts Go歌词：

Counted all my mistakes and there's only one  
Standing out from the list of the things I've done  
All the rest of my crimes don't come close  
To the look on your face when I let you go

So I built you a house from a broken home  
And I wrote you a song with the words you spoke

Yeah, it took me some time, but I figured out  
How to fix up a heart that I let down

Now I'm searching every lonely place  
Every corner calling out your name  
Tryna find you, but I just don't know  
Where do broken hearts go?  
Where do broken hearts go?

Yeah, the taste of your lips on the tip of my tongue  
Is at the top of the list of the things I want  
Mind is running in circles of you and me  
Anyone in between is the enemy

Shadows come with the pain that you're running from  
Love was something you've never heard enough

Yeah, it took me some time, but I figured out  
How to fix up a heart that I let down

Now I'm searching every lonely place  
Every corner calling out your name  
Tryna find you, but I just don't know  
Where do broken hearts go?

Are you sleeping, baby by yourself?  
Or are you giving it to someone else?  
Try to find you, but I just don't know  
Where do broken hearts go?  
Where do broken hearts go?

Tell me now, tell me now,  
Tell me where you go when you feel afraid?  
Tell me now, tell me now,  
Tell me will you ever love me again, love me again?

Now I'm searching every lonely place  
Every corner calling out your name  
Tryna find you, but I just don't know  
Where do broken hearts go?

Are you sleeping, baby, by yourself?  
Or are you giving it to someone else?  
Try to find you, but I just don't know  
Where do broken hearts go?

Tell me where you're hiding out  
Where do broken hearts go?  
Come on, baby, 'cause I need you now  
Where do broken hearts go?  
Tell me, 'cause I’m ten feet down  
Where do broken hearts go?

Come on, baby, come and get me out  
Come on, baby, come and get me out  
Come on, baby, 'cause I need you now

Where do broken hearts go?  
Where do broken hearts go?  
Where do broken hearts go?  
Where do broken hearts go?
