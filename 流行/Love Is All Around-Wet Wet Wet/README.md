**Love Is All Around** 是苏格兰的著名乐队Wet Wet Wet的一首翻唱歌曲。Wet Wet Wet
成立于1982年，乐队的四位成员是：Graeme Clark（贝司手兼主唱），Neil Mitchell（键盘手），Marti
Pellow（主唱）以及Tom cunningham（鼓手）。

由于乐队成员明显感到自己在乐坛中身处颓势，更加对专辑的出版不敢掉以轻心。1994年，Wet Wet Wet 凭藉影片《四个婚礼和一个葬礼》中之感人插曲《
_Love Is All Around_ 》再度蜚声世界流行乐坛，而且在商业上取得了巨大的成功。

### Love Is All Around歌词：

I feel it in my fingers, I feel it in my toes  
Love is all around me and so the feeling grows  
It's written on the wind, it's everywhere I go  
So if you really love me, come on and let it show  
You know I love you I always will  
My mind's made up by the way that I feel  
There's no beginning, there'll be no end  
'Cause on my love you can depend  
I see your face before me, as I lay on my bed  
I kinda get to thinking of all the things we said  
You gave a promise to me, and I gave mine to you  
I need someone beside me in everything I do  
You know I love you I always will  
My mind's made up by the way that I feel  
There's no beginning, there'll be no end  
'Cause on my love you can depend  
It's written on the wind, it's everywhere I go  
So if you really love me, come on and let it show  
Come on and let it show  
Come on and let it show
