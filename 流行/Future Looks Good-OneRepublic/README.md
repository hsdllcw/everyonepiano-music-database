### Future Looks Good歌词：

Woke up starin' at this  
Starin' at this empty room  
Looked at  
Thousand different pictures that your mother took of you  
You see I had this crazy dream last night  
This man he talked to me  
He told me  
Everything that's good and bad about my history  
But he said that you are  
You are the future  
He said that you are  
You are the future  
And the future looks good  
The future looks good  
Oh call me any time that  
Every time you're losin' it  
And tell me  
Anyone and everyone who makes you feel like shit  
Because you know  
Anybody everybody else can lie  
But honey I won't  
See you with a see you with a broken set of eyes  
I swear that you are  
You are the future  
I swear that you are you are  
The future  
And the future looks good  
Oh yeah  
The future looks good  
Oh yeah  
The future looks good  
Oh yeah  
The future looks good  
Oh yeah  
You you  
You  
You you  
You  
Woke up starin' at this  
Starin' at this empty room  
Looked at  
Thousand different pictures that your mother took of you
