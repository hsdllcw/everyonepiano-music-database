### Valerie歌词：

Well sometimes I go out by myself  
and I look across the water  
And I think of all the things  
what you're doing and in my head I make a picture  
Cos since I've come on home  
well my body's been a mess  
And I've missed your ginger hair  
and the way you like to dress  
Won't you come on over,  
stop making a fool out of me  
why don't you come over  
valerie,valerie,valerie,valerie  
Did you have to go to jail  
put your house on up for sale,  
did you get a good lawyer  
I hope you didn't catch a tan,  
I hope you find the right man who'll fix it for you  
Are you shopping anywhere,  
changed the colour of your hair,are you busy  
And did you have to pay the fine  
you were dodging all the time are you still busy  
Cos since I've come on home,  
well my body's been a mess  
And I've missed your ginger hair  
and the way you like to dress  
Why won't you come on over  
stop making a fool out of me  
Valerie,why don't you come over Valerie  
Valerie, Valerie Valerie  
Well sometimes I go out by myself  
and I look across the water  
And I think of all the things,  
what you're doing and in my head I make a picture  
Cos since I've come on home,  
well my body's been a mess  
And I've missed your ginger hair  
and the way you like to dress  
Won't you come on over, stop making a fool out of me  
Why won't you come on over Valerie, Valerie.  
Valerie, Valerie  
Yeah Valerie Valerie Valerie Valerie Velerie Valerie why don't you come over
Valerie
