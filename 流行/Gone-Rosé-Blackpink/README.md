《 **Gone** 》是一首将离开的恋人进行最后整理的心，通过吉他为主的简洁编曲和ROSÉ有号召力的嗓音，清淡地表达出来的歌曲。

虽然并不华丽，但是富有节制感的歌曲的进行和构成，更进一步突出了这首歌想要表达的话语。磁性的嗓音在真假音间切换得游刃有余，中音在轻缓节奏中更是变成了耳膜杀手，开口便让人沉溺其中，难以自拔。这种独斟微醺的感觉，似是把骨中那股寂寞丝丝抽出。

### Gone歌词：

I thought that you remember but it seems that you forgot  
It's hard for me to blame you when you were already lost oh yeah  
I'm tired of always waiting oh yeah yeah  
I see you changed your number  
That's why you don't get my calls  
I gave you all of me now  
You don't want to be involved oh yeah yeah  
I really gotta face it oh yeah yeah  
I just wanna be the one  
But to you we're already done  
Tell me why'd you have to hit and run me  
Now I'm all alone crying ugly  
You broke my heart just for fun  
Took my love and just left me numb  
Now it's 8 in the morning  
Hate in the morning  
All because of you  
Another story that's sad and true  
I can feel the pain can you  
You had to be the one to let me down  
To color me blue  
Hate to see you with someone new  
I'll put a curse on her and you  
Ain't no looking back now you're dead and gone  
My love is gone too  
All my love is gone  
All my love is gone  
All my love is gone  
All my love is gone  
Now you're dead and gone  
All my love is gone and the hate has grown  
Standing all alone and I'm searching for something  
But I can't feel nothin'  
I pack my bags and go  
This don't feel like home  
Too much darkness for a rainbow  
I feel so used  
How am I supposed to live without you  
I refuse yeah  
I just wanna be the one  
But to you we're already done  
Tell me why'd you have to hit and run me  
Now I'm all alone crying ugly  
You broke my heart just for fun  
Took my love and just left me numb  
Now it's 8 in the morning  
Hate in the morning  
All because of you  
Another story that's sad and true  
I can feel the pain can you  
You had to be the one to let me down  
To color me blue  
Hate to see you with someone new  
I'll put a curse on her and you  
Ain't no looking back now you're dead and gone  
My love is gone too  
All my love is gone  
All my love is gone  
All my love is gone  
All my love is gone  
Now you're dead and gone
