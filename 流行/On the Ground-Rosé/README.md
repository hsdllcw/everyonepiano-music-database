### On the Ground歌词：

My life's been magic seems fantastic  
I used to have a hole in the wall with a mattress  
It's funny when you want it  
Suddenly you have it  
You find out that your gold's just plastic  
Every day every night  
I've been thinking back on you and I  
Every day every night  
I worked my whole life  
Just to get right just to be like  
Look at me I'm never coming down  
I worked my whole life  
Just to get high just to realize  
Everything I need is on the  
Everything I need is on the ground  
On the ground  
Everything I need is on the ground  
Nah but they don't hear me though  
Yeah what goes up it must come down  
Nah but they don't hear me though  
You're running out of time  
My world's been hectic seems electric  
But I've been waking up with your voice in my head  
And I'm trying to send a message  
And let you know that every single minute I'm without you I regret it  
Every day every night  
I've been thinking back on you and I  
Every day every night  
I worked my whole life  
Just to get right just to be like  
Look at me I'm never coming down  
I worked my whole life  
Just to get high just to realize  
Everything I need is on the  
Everything I need is on the ground  
On the ground  
Everything I need is on the ground  
Nah but they don't hear me though  
Yeah what goes up it must come down  
Nah but they don't hear me though  
You're running out of time  
I'm way up in the clouds  
And they say I've made it now  
But I figured it out  
Everything I need is on the ground  
Just drove by your house  
So far from you now  
But I figured it out  
Everything I need is on the  
Everything I need is on the ground  
On the ground  
Everything I need is on the ground  
Nah but they don't hear me though  
On the ground  
Nah but they don't hear me though  
Everything I need is on the ground
