### Break My Heart Again歌词：

Hey you  
I'm just now leaving  
Can I come around later on this evening  
Or do you need time  
Yes of course that's fine  
Hey you  
Good morning  
I'm sure you're busy now why else would you ignore me  
Or do you need space  
You can't help it if your mind has changed  
So go ahead and break my heart again  
Leave me wonderin' why the hell I ever let you in  
Are you the definition of insanity  
Or am I  
Oh it must be nice  
To love someone who let's you break them twice  
You're so blue  
Are you still breathing  
Won't you tell me if you found that deeper meaning  
Do you think I've gone blind  
I know it's not the truth when you say I'm fine  
So go ahead and break my heart again  
Leave me wonderin' why the hell I ever let you in  
Are you the definition of insanity  
Or am I  
Oh it must be nice  
To love someone who let's you break them twice  
Don't pretend that I'm the instigator  
You were the one but you were born to say goodbye  
Kissed me half a decade later  
That same perfume those same sad eyes  
Go ahead and break my heart again  
Leave me wonderin' why the hell I ever let you in  
Are you the definition of insanity  
Or am I  
Or am I  
It must be nice  
To love someone who let's you break them twice
