**Until It Sleeps** 是美国重金属乐队Metallica演唱的歌曲。

二十世纪七十年代后期，欧美摇滚乐坛上“重金属”音乐正在鼎盛时期，而此时出现的Thrash
Metal（激流金属）像一股洪流一样冲击着乐坛。这种流派的创始者就是1981年在美国洛杉矶组建的金属乐队Metallica（金属乐队）Metallica无疑是从上世纪80年代至今世界上最杰出和最有影响力的重金属乐队。乐队的一大贡献在于扩展了传统鞭笞金属的含义，从Metallica开始，复杂的编曲和大量华丽的吉他独奏也同样属于Thrash
Metal。这种风格加上James Hetfield那极富冲击力的演唱，使Metallica长期处于重金属的统治地位。

### Until It Sleeps歌词：

Where do I take this pain of mine  
I run but it stays right by my side  
So tear me open and pour me out  
There's things inside that scream and shout  
And the pain still hates me  
So hold me until it sleeps  
Just like the curse just like the stray  
You feed it once and now it stays  
Now it stays  
So tear me open but beware  
There's things inside without a care  
And the dirt still stains me  
So wash me until I'm clean  
It grips you so hold me  
It stains you so hold me  
It hates you so hold me  
It holds you so hold me  
Until it sleeps  
So tell me why you've chosen me  
Don't want your grip don't want your greed  
Don't want it  
I'll tear me open make you gone  
No more can you hurt anyone  
And the fear still shakes me  
So hold me until it sleeps  
It grips you so hold me  
It stains you so hold me  
It hates you so hold me  
It holds you holds you holds you  
Until it sleeps  
Until it sleeps  
Until it sleeps  
Until it sleeps  
I don't want it I don't want it want it want it want it want it noo  
So tear me open but beware  
There's things inside without a care  
And the dirt still stains me  
So wash me 'till I'm clean  
I'll tear me open make you gone  
No longer will you hurt anyone  
And the hate still shames me  
So hold me  
Until it sleeps  
Until it sleeps  
Until it sleeps  
Until it sleeps  
Until it sleeps
