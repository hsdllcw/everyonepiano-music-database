### Yellow Flicker Beat歌词：

I'm a princess cut from marble  
性似岩岬  
smoother than a storm  
温胜骤雨  
And the scars that mark my body, they*re silver andgold  
伤成瑾瑜  
My blood is a flood of rubies,precious stones  
血如红玉  
It keeps my veins hot, the fires find a home in me  
脉络灼灼 身宿火  
I move through town, I*m quiet like a fire And mynecklace is a ropeI tie it
and untie it,  
客过他乡 吾如炎毁 燃尽项上绳  
And our people talk to me, but nothing ever hits  
吾众所言未能摄  
So people talk to me, and all the voices just burn holes  
所言似枯穴  
I*m going in  
纵身一跃  
This is the start of how it all ever ends  
破旧立新  
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it  
昔呼我名者无勇复蹈  
I*m speeding up and this is the  
快步流星  
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart  
赤彤丹朱 玄黄踯踏  
But I got my fingers laced together and I made a little prison  
And I*m locking up everyone that ever laid afinger on me  
柔荑织囹圄，蔑我者尽囚  
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it  
昔呼我名者无勇复蹈  
I*m speeding up and this is the  
快步流星  
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart  
赤彤丹朱 玄黄踯踏  
We*re at the start, the colors disappear  
下车伊始令万物哑然  
I never watch the stars there*s so much down here  
未曾见寒星盈盈银汉迢迢  
So I just try to keep up with them  
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up myheart  
但愿依此赤彤丹朱 玄黄踯踏  
And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat  
Sparking up my heart  
赤彤丹朱 玄黄踯踏  
And this is the red, orange, yellow flickerbeat-beat-beat-beat  
赤彤丹朱 玄黄踯踏
