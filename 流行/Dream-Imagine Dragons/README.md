### Dream歌词：

In the dark  
And I’m right on the middle mark  
I’m just in the tier of everything that rides below the surface  
And I watch from a distance seventeen  
And I’m short of the others dreams of being golden and on top  
It’s not what you painted in my head  
There’s so much there instead of all the colors that I saw

We all are living in a dream,  
But life ain’t what it seems  
Oh everything’s a mess  
And all these sorrows I have seen  
They lead me to believe  
That everything’s a mess

But I wanna dream  
I wanna dream  
Leave me to dream

In the eyes  
Of a teenage crystallized  
Oh the prettiest of lights that hang the hallways of the home  
And the cries from the strangers out at night  
They don’t keep us up at night  
We have the curtains drawn and closed

We all are living in a dream,  
But life ain’t what it seems  
Oh everything’s a mess  
And all these sorrows I have seen  
They lead me to believe  
That everything’s a mess

But I wanna dream  
I wanna dream  
Leave me to dream

I know all your reasons  
To keep me from seeing  
Everything is actually a mess  
But now I am leaving  
All of us were only dreaming  
Everything is actually a mess

We all are living in a dream  
But life ain’t what it seems  
Oh everything’s a mess  
And all these sorrows I have seen  
They lead me to believe  
That everything’s a mess

But I wanna dream  
I wanna dream  
Leave me to dream

I wanna dream  
I wanna dream  
Leave me to dream
