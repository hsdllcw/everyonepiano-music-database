**Call You Mine双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Call You Mine_ 是由美国电子音乐组合烟鬼组合（The Chainsmokers）制作，和Bebe
Rexha演唱的一首歌曲，于2019年5月31日由索尼音乐发行。歌曲讲述的是一段年轻的、逐渐消逝的感情，在这段感情中，双方都不确定他们的关系是否有希望，考虑到如果没有彼此，他们的生活将会怎样。Bebe非常具有磁性穿透力的嗓音，加上烟鬼节奏感不是特别强的电音，简直是完美。

### Call You Mine歌词：

2 kids with their hearts on fire  
Who's gonna save us now  
When we thought that we couldn't get higher  
Things started looking down  
I look at you and you look at me  
Like nothing but strangers now  
2 kids with their hearts on fire  
Don't let it burn us out  
Think about what you believe in now  
Am I someone you cannot live without out  
Cause I know I don't wanna live without you  
Yeah  
Come on let's turn this all around  
Bring it all back to that bar downtown  
When you wouldn't let me walk out on you  
Yeah  
You said hey whatcha doing for the rest of your life  
And I said I don't even know what I'm doing tonight  
Went from one conversation to your lips on mine  
And you said I never regretted the day that I called you mine  
So I call you mine  
Can I call you mine  
And you said I never regretted the day that I called you mine  
Broke kids running through the city  
Drunk on the subway train  
Set free every time you kissed me  
We couldn't feel no pain  
You looked at me and I looked at you  
Like we'd never look away  
Broke kids running through the city  
Don't let the memory fade  
You said hey whatcha doing for the rest of your life  
And I said I don't even know what I'm doing tonight  
Went from one conversation to your lips on mine  
And you said I never regretted the day that I called you mine  
So I call you mine  
Can I call you mine  
And you said I never regretted the day that I called you mine  
Think about what you believe in now  
Am I someone you cannot live without  
Cause I know I don't wanna live without you  
Yeah  
Come on let's turn this all around  
Bring it all back to that bar downtown  
When you wouldn't let me walk out on you  
You said hey whatcha doing for the rest of your life  
And I said I don't even know what I'm doing tonight  
Went from one conversation to your lips on mine  
And you said I never regretted the day that I called you mine  
So I call you mine  
And you said I never regretted the day that I called you mine  
Can I call you mine  
Can I call you mine  
Can I call you mine  
Can I call you mine
