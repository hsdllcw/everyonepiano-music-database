### Everything I Own歌词：

You sheltered me from harm  
Kept me warm, kept me warm  
You gave my life to me  
Set me free, set me free  
The finest years I ever knew  
Were all the years I had with you

And I would give anything I own  
Give up my life, my heart, my home  
I would give everything I own  
Just to have you back again

You taught me how to love  
What it's of, what it's of  
You never said too much  
But still you showed the way  
And I knew from watching you  
Nobody else could ever know  
The part of me that can't let go

And I would give anything I own  
Give up my life, my heart, my home  
I would give everything I own  
Just to have you back again

Is there someone you know  
You're loving them so  
But taking them all for granted  
You may lose them one day  
Someone takes them away  
And they don't hear the words you long to say

I would give anything I own  
Give up my life, my heart, my home  
I would give everything I own  
Just to have you back again  
Just to touch you once again
