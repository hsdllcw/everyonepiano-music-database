### Raging歌词：

Standing in the cold in the frozen wind  
I'm leaving you behind but it's not the end  
No, no, no  
Walking on a plain as I hold my breath  
It's gonna be weeks 'til I breathe again  
No, no, no

I know that you hate it  
And I hate it just as much as you  
But if you can brave it, I can brave it  
Brave it all for you

Call me anytime that you see the lightning  
Don't you feel alone, you can always find me  
We've got a wild love raging, raging  
Lost among a million changing faces  
Every day our hearts keep trading places  
We've got a wild love raging, raging

Raging, raging  
Raging, raging  
Raging, raging

Checking into hotel loneliness  
It's not what I've been used to, I confess  
To wake up three times a night  
Talking to a stranger's nothing new  
She knows how to smile, but not like you  
So I wait for you all night

I know that you hate it  
And I hate it just as much as you  
But if you can brave it, I can brave it  
Brave it all for you

Call me anytime that you see the lightning  
Don't you feel alone, you can always find me  
We've got a wild love raging, raging  
Lost among a million changing faces  
Every day our hearts keep trading places  
We've got a wild love raging, raging

Raging, raging

Call me anytime that you see the lightning  
Don't you feel alone, you can always find me  
We've got a wild love raging, raging  
Rolling on the wind with you forever  
Holding onto us for worse or better  
We've got a wild love raging, raging

Raging, raging  
Raging, raging

Call me anytime that you see the lightning  
Never feel alone, you can always find me  
We've got a wild love raging, raging
