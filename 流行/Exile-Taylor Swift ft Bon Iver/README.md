**Exile** 是美国女歌手Taylor Swift与Bon Iver一同合作的歌曲，被收录在Taylor
Swift于2020年7月24日发行的第八张录音室专辑《Folklore》，为其所属专辑中的第4首。

歌曲对于氛围的营造很美妙，男人“wu～”的嗓音、女声副歌时加入的部分合声、乐器的合成运用都无不给人一种静谧之感。就像是无比辽阔却又烟雾蒙蒙的草原，杂草丛生已经几近你的腰部，而我只能看着你渐远，一如歌里唱的那样“Now
I’m in exile seeing you out”。

### Exile歌词：

I can see you standing honey  
With his arms around your body  
Laughing but the joke's not funny at all  
And it took you five whole minutes  
To pack us up and leave me with it  
Holding all this love out here in the hall  
I think I've seen this film before  
And I didn't like the ending  
You're not my homeland anymore  
So what am I defending now  
You were my town  
Now I'm in exile seeing you out  
I think I've seen this film before  
I can see you staring honey  
Like he's just your understudy  
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me  
Second third and hundredth chances  
Balancing on breaking branches  
Those eyes add insult to injury  
I think I've seen this film before  
And I didn't like the ending  
I'm not your problem anymore  
So who am I offending now  
You were my crown  
Now I'm in exile seeing you out  
I think I've seen this film before  
So I'm leaving out the side door  
So step right out  
There is no amount  
Of crying I can do for you  
All this time  
We always walked a very thin line  
You didn't even hear me out  
Didn't even hear me out  
You never gave a warning sign  
I gave so many signs  
All this time  
I never learned to read your mind  
Never learned to read my mind  
I couldn't turn things around  
You never turned things around  
Cause you never gave a warning sign  
I gave so many signs  
So many signs  
So many signs  
You didn't even see the signs  
I think I've seen this film before  
And I didn't like the ending  
You're not my homeland anymore  
So what am I defending now  
You were my town  
Now I'm in exile seeing you out  
I think I've seen this film before  
So I'm leaving out the side door  
So step right out  
There is no amount  
Of crying I can do for you  
All this time  
We always walked a very thin line  
You didn't even hear me out  
Didn't even hear me out  
You never gave a warning sign  
I gave so many signs  
All this time  
I never learned to read your mind  
Never learned to read my mind  
I couldn't turn things around  
You never turned things around  
Cause you never gave a warning sign  
I gave so many signs  
So many signs  
So many signs  
Cause you never gave a warning sign  
I gave so many signs
