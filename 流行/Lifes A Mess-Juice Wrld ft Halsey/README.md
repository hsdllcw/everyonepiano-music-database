**Life's A Mess** 是Juice Wrld联手Halsey的全新单曲，发行于2020年7月6日。

音乐是传递情感的东西，总有一些旋律，或是满溢着幸福，或是饱含忧伤，它们都直击人们的心灵。客观来说没有最好的歌曲，主观来看，那些最好的歌曲恰恰是最打动人心，引起人们共鸣的，就像这首
_Life's A Mess_
，对我来说，小果汁独唱那段感觉是我内心的折射，而最后猴西那几句唱出了我的内心独白。他们的嗓音虽然平静，但是却像一弯溪流清澈干净地缓缓流入我的心田，治愈着我。

### Life's A Mess歌词：

Juice WRLD：  
Have you ever fallen head over heels for somebody  
Not just somebody  
No no  
But she did again  
Have you ever fallen head over heels for somebody  
That made promises that give you the world  
Um  
I really hope they held you down  
I really hope it was no lying 'cause when heart breaks  
It feel like the world's gone  
But if the love's real you'd feel your soul roar like a lion  
And you'd finally let bygones be bygones  
Don't throw in the towel I know it feels like you're the only one trying  
You just gotta learn to live and love on  
I belong with the one put on this earth for me  
Everybody has their someone just gotta look and see  
I'm screaming out "Lord help me I've been lonely"  
That's when you accept me  
Then you set me free  
Uh sometimes life's a mess  
Uh I get high when I'm upset  
I remember when me and love didn't click  
Searching for somethin' real then I found it  
Uh-uh sometimes life's a mess  
Yeah I get high when I'm upset  
I remember when me and love ain't click  
Looking for somethin' real then I found it  
Can't put you f**king back well it's better now  
Through the trials and tribulations I found my way out  
Feel all of the good and bad vibrations all around  
All around us they surround us  
Was a lost cause with some lost love  
It ain't my fault pain chose us then I found her  
My whole world turned upside down uh  
But for the better  
I belong with the one put on this earth for me  
Everybody has their someone just gotta look and see  
I'm screaming out "Lord help me I've been lonely"  
That's when you accept me  
Then you set me free  
Juice WRLD/Halsey：  
Uh sometimes life's a mess  
Uh I get high when I'm upset  
I remember when me and love didn't click  
Searching for somethin' real then I found it  
Uh-uh sometimes life's a mess  
Yeah I get high when I'm upset  
I remember when me and love ain't click  
Looking for somethin' real then I found it  
Halsey：  
Uh uh uh uh  
Uh uh uh uh  
Uh uh uh uh  
Uh uh uh uh  
Thank God I finally found you  
You put the light in my eyes when I'm around you  
I'm too flawed to hold you down but  
Don't wanna be here alone  
And I thank God I finally found you  
I'll put the light in your eyes if I'm allowed to  
I'm too flawed to hold you down but  
Don't let me be here alone
