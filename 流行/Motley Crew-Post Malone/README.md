### Motley Crew歌词：

d.a. got that d**e  
Count up the bands stickin' out  
No rubberband is big enough  
Chain is so heavy can't pick it up  
Came with the gang a myriad  
I see your whip hilarious  
Where is my roof  
Mysterious  
My whip from Fast & Furious  
Curtains with yellow interior  
I get the commas period  
Covered in ice Siberia  
I'm at the top of the pyramid  
B***h I'm a star I'm Sirius  
We came to play it's serious  
Came with the gang a myriad  
Came with the gang a myriad  
Came with the motley crew  
Sit-up pour I just forgot where I was  
Pour it up throw it up sit up what  
Get up b***h get up b***h get up  
Came with a wig splitter  
I got John Wick hitters  
I'ma go get get up  
Wow uh  
Camе with the army army army yeah  
The people 'round me still the same  
We just wanna party party party yeah  
We rowdy and we'll never chill  
Count up the bands stickin' out  
No rubberband is big enough  
Chain is so heavy can't pick it up  
Came with the gang a myriad  
I see your whip hilarious  
Where is my roof  
Mysterious  
My whip from Fast & Furious  
Curtains with yellow interior  
I get the commas period  
Covered in ice Siberia  
I'm at the top of the pyramid  
B***h I'm a star I'm Sirius  
We came to play it's serious  
Came with the gang a myriad  
Came with the gang a myriad  
Came with the motley crew  
What you gon' do  
I'ma pull up with the crew  
When I'm off the juice I like to hang out the roof  
I'm rockin' jewels I like when the diamonds they move  
I just go through I do not wait in a queue  
Baby-baby pinky Brady Brady  
AP navy-navy chain like two Mercedes  
I'll come when they pay me come with Katy Amy  
Crew go crazy crazy kick it down daily uh  
Came with the army army army yeah  
The people 'round me still the same  
We just wanna party party party yeah  
We rowdy and we'll never chill  
Count up the bands stickin' out  
No rubberband is big enough  
Chain is so heavy can't pick it up  
Came with the gang a myriad  
I see your whip hilarious  
Where is my roof  
Mysterious  
My whip from Fast & Furious  
Curtains with yellow interior  
I get the commas period  
Covered in ice Siberia  
I'm at the top of the pyramid  
B***h I'm a star I'm Sirius  
We came to play it's serious  
Came with the gang a myriad  
Came with the gang a myriad  
Came with the motley crew
