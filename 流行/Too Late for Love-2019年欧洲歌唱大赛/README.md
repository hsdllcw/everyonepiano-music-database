### Too Late for Love歌词：

Hey how you've been  
I wonder do you ever think of me  
Say am I wrong  
To wonder if it could be you and me  
Is it too late for love Hmm  
Is it too late for love I wanna know  
Is it too late for love I can't take no more  
Is it  
I could be the sun that lights your dark  
Maybe I would lit your world with just one spark  
I could make it burn for you and me  
If I could be there I would be there  
Hear me  
I could be the sun that lights your dark  
Is it too late for love Is it too late for love  
Hear me  
I could make it burn for you and me  
Days came and went  
But nothing ever really felt the same  
'Cause you left a space  
Where everything reminds me of your face  
Is it too late for love Hmm  
Is it too late for love I wanna know  
I could be the sun that lights your dark  
Maybe I would lit your world with just one spark  
I could make it burn for you and me  
If I could be there I would be there  
Hear me  
I could be the sun that lights your dark  
Is it too late for love  
Oh no is it too late for love  
Hear me  
I could make it burn for you and me  
Is it too late for love Is it too late for love  
We could be a storm that rages on  
Maybe we would own the ocean carry on  
I could be the sun that lights your dark  
Maybe I would lit your world with just one spark  
I could make it burn for you and me  
If I could be there I would be there  
Hear me  
I could be the sun that light your dark  
Is it too late for love  
Is it too late for love  
Is it too late for love  
But is is too late for love  
Is it
