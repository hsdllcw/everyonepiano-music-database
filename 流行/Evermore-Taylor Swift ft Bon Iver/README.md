### Evermore歌词：

Taylor Swift：  
Gray November  
I've been down since July  
Motion capture  
Put me in a bad light  
I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone  
Trying to find the one where I went wrong  
Writing letters  
Addressed to the fire  
Taylor Swift：  
And I was catching my breath  
Staring out an open window  
Catching my death  
And I couldn't be sure  
I had a feeling so peculiar  
That this pain would be for  
Evermore  
Taylor Swift：  
Hey December  
Guess I'm feeling unmoored  
Can't remember  
What I used to fight for  
I rewind the tape but all it does is pause  
On the very moment all was lost  
Sending signals  
To be double-crossed  
Taylor Swift/Justin Vernon：  
And I was catching my breath  
Barefoot in the wildest winter  
Catching my death  
And I couldn't be sure  
I had a feeling so peculiar  
That this pain would be for  
Evermore  
Evermore  
Justin Vernon：  
Can't not think of all the cost  
And the things that will be lost  
Oh can we just get a pause  
To be certain we'll be tall again  
Whether weather be the frost  
Or the violence of the dog days  
I'm on waves out being tossed  
Is there a line that I could just go cross  
Taylor Swift/Justin Vernon：  
And when I was shipwrecked  
Can't think of all the cost  
I thought of you  
All the things that will be lost now  
In the cracks of light  
Can we just get a pause  
I dreamed of you  
To be certain we'll be tall again  
If you think of all the costs  
It was real enough  
Whether weather be the frost  
To get me through  
Or the violence of the dog days  
Or the violence of the dog days  
I'm on waves out being tossed  
I'm on waves out being tossed  
I swear  
Is there a line that we could just go cross  
You were there  
Taylor Swift/Justin Vernon：  
And I was catching my breath  
Floors of a cabin creaking under my step  
And I couldn't be sure  
I had a feeling so peculiar  
This pain wouldn't be for  
Evermore  
Evermore  
Evermore  
This pain wouldn't be for evermore  
Evermore
