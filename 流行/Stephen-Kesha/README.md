### Stephen歌词：

Stephen  
Stephen  
Why won't you call me?  
Stephen  
Why won't you call me?  
I saw you  
In your tight ass rocker pants  
You saw me too  
I laughed  
'Cause I was completely trashed  
And I watched your  
Ugly girlfriend  
Sneer across the room  
As if I really care  
That she's here with you  
All I know is...  
Your my object of affection  
My drug of choice  
My sick obsession  
Stephen  
Why won't you call me?  
I'm sitting here waiting  
Why won't you call me?  
Stephen  
I'm feeling pathetic  
I can't take rejection  
Why won't you call me?  
I've got guys  
Waiting in a line  
For me too play  
My evil girly games  
With all their minds  
Just watch me  
Got it down  
To a simple art  
Just bat my Eyes  
Like this  
And there's a broken heart  
But somehow...  
You turn the tables  
What the hell  
I can charm the pants of anyone else  
But you  
Stephen  
Why won't you call me?  
I'm sitting here waiting  
Why won't you call me?  
Stephen  
I'm feeling pathetic  
I can't take rejection  
Why won't you call me?  
Stephen  
I'm thinking' that  
Maybe  
You might think I'm  
Crazy  
Is that why you won't  
Call me  
Steve  
Don't you think I'm  
Pretty  
Do you not  
Love me  
Is that why you won't call me?  
'Cause your my object of affection  
My drug of choice  
My sick obsession  
I want to keep you as my pet to play with  
And hide under my bed forever  
Stephen  
Why won't you call me?  
I'm sitting here waiting  
Why won't you call me?  
Stephen  
I'm feeling pathetic  
I can't take rejection  
Why won't you call me?  
Stephen  
I'll knit you a sweater  
I want to wrap you up in my love  
Forever  
I will never let you go Stephen  
I'll never let go  
Stephen  
Why won't you call me?  
I'm sitting here waiting  
Why won't you call me?  
Stephen  
I'm feeling pathetic  
I can't take rejection  
Why won't you call me?
