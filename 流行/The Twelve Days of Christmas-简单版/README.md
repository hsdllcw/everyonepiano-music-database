**The Twelve Days of Christmas**
这首歌的歌词，表面上是讲圣诞节的十二天里要做的事，看起来其实就只是一首很可爱的歌而已，好像没有什么太大的含意在里面，其实，不只是这样喔！ _The
Twelve Days of Christmas_ 可以说是一首寓意极为深远的“启蒙歌曲”。

这首圣诞歌最原始是由英国的新教派所写成，由于十六世纪之后的一两百年，英格兰的国会并不承认这个教派，所以他们依法不能传教，或公开从事他们的信仰活动。在当时，身为一位新教徒可是违法的呢！被抓到之后，轻则牢狱之灾，重则被砍头或被吊死都有可能。既然如此，新教派应该如何秘密传教呢？于是，他们便写了这首歌！歌曲乍听之下跟宗教完全不相干，只是在讲十二天里要为圣诞节准备十二种礼物，其实，这十二种礼物暗示着里十二种宗教上的含义。

### The Twelve Days of Christmas歌词：

On the first day of Christmas  
My true love sent to me  
A partridge in a pear tree  
On the second day of Christmas  
My true love sent to me  
Two turtle doves  
And a partridge in a pear tree  
On the third day of Christmas  
My true love sent to me  
Three French hens  
Two turtle doves  
And a partridge in a pear tree  
On the fourth day of Christmas  
My true love sent to me  
Four calling birds  
Three French hens  
Two turtle doves  
And a partridge in a pear tree  
On the fifth day of Christmas  
My true love sent to me  
Five gold rings  
Four calling birds  
Three French hens  
Two turtle doves  
And a partridge in a pear tree  
On the sixth day of Christmas  
My true love sent to me  
Six geese a-laying  
Five gold rings  
Four calling birds  
Three French hens  
Two turtle doves  
And a partridge in a pear tree  
On the seventh day of Christmas  
My true love sent to me  
Seven swans a-swimming  
Six geese a-laying  
Five gold rings  
Four calling birds  
Three French hens  
Two turtle doves  
And a partridge in a pear tree  
On the eighth day of Christmas  
My true love sent to me  
Eight maids a-milking  
Seven swans a-swimming  
Six geese a-laying  
Five gold rings  
Four calling birds  
Three French hens  
Two turtle doves  
And a partridge in a pear tree  
On the ninth day of Christmas  
My true love sent to me  
Nine ladies dancing  
Eight maids a-milking  
Seven swans a-swimming  
Six geese a-laying  
Five gold rings  
Four calling birds  
Three French hens  
Two turtle doves  
And a partridge in a pear tree  
On the tenth day of Christmas  
My true love sent to me  
Ten Lords a Leaping  
Nine ladies dancing  
Eight maids a-milking  
Seven swans a-swimming  
Six geese a-laying  
Five gold rings  
Four calling birds  
Three French hens  
Two turtle doves  
And a partridge in a pear tree  
On the eveth day of Christmas  
My true love sent to me  
Eleven Pipers Piping  
Ten Lords a Leaping  
Nine ladies dancing  
Eight maids a-milking  
Seven swans a-swimming  
Six geese a-laying  
Five golden Rings  
Four calling birds  
Three French hens  
Two turtle doves  
And a partridge in a pear tree  
On the Twelve day of Christmas  
My true love sent to me  
Twelve Drummers Drumming  
Eleven Pipers Piping  
Ten Lords a Leaping  
Nine ladies dancing  
Eight maids a-milking  
Seven swans a-swimming  
Six geese a-laying  
Five golden Rings  
Four calling birds  
Three French hens  
Two turtle doves  
And a partridge in a pear tree  
And a partridge in a pear tree
