### More Than a Feeling歌词：

I looked out this morning and the sun was gone  
Turned on some music to start my day  
I lost myself in a familiar song  
I closed my eyes and I slipped away

It's more than a feeling, when I hear that old song they used to play (more
than a feeling)  
I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)  
'Till I see Marianne walk away  
I see my Marianne walkin' away

So many people have come and gone  
Their faces fade as the years go by  
Yet I still recall as I wander on  
As clear as the sun in the summer sky

It's more than a feeling, when I hear that old song they used to play (more
than a feeling)  
I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)  
'Till I see Marianne walk away  
I see my Marianne walkin' away

When I'm tired and thinking cold  
I hide in my music, forget the day  
And dream of a girl I used to know  
I closed my eyes and she slipped away  
She slipped away

It's more than a feeling, when I hear that old song they used to play (more
than a feeling)  
I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)  
'Till I see Marianne walk away
