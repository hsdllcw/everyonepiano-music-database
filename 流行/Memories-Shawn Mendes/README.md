### Memories歌词：

When I wake up to your footsteps  
As you get up out of the bed  
They make a song that sounds so simple  
But it dances in my head  
A melody so perfect  
That it gets me through the day  
And the thought of us forever  
Is one that won't ever go away  
All I need to know is  
Where to start  
Take my hand and show me forever  
As I never will I ever let you go  
So let's hold on together  
To this paper and this pen  
And write down every letter  
To every word we've ever said  
All I need to know is  
Where to start  
Take my hand and show me forever  
As I never will I ever let you go  
Let's write our story  
And let's sing our song  
Let's hang our pictures on the wall  
All these precious moments  
That we carved in stone  
Are only memories after all  
Memories after all  
Memories after all  
You know  
You gave me hope  
But I've got to let go  
I've got to let go  
It's taking its toll  
Deep in my soul  
Now I've got to let go  
We wrote our story  
And we sang our songs  
We hung our pictures on the wall  
Now those precious moments  
That we carved in stone  
Are only memories after all
