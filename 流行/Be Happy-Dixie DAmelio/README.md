### Be Happy歌词：

Sometimes I don't wanna be happy  
Don't hold it against me  
If I'm down just leave me there  
Let me be sad  
Sun's up I already wanna lay down  
Friends calling are you really tryna go out  
No  
Don't wanna get dressed up to pretend  
No  
I can lie and say I'm fine  
Maybe you'll stop calling then  
I've got chips on my shoulder  
Only getting older  
So I keep to myself  
Ain't tryna complain  
Just don't wanna explain it  
But  
Sometimes I don't wanna be happy  
Don't hold it against me  
If I'm down just leave me there  
Let me be sad  
Sometimes I just wanna be lonely  
Don't need you to hold me  
If I'm low you don't need to care  
Let me be sad  
What's the matter with that  
Oh oh oh  
What's the matter with that  
Oh oh oh  
What's the matter with  
Bad days it's okay let me feel it  
Uh huh uh huh  
And some days you've got to break your heart to heal it  
Heal it  
I know I'm gonna feel this way again  
I can lie and say I'm fine  
But that wouldn't change anything  
I've got chips on my shoulder  
Only getting older  
So I keep to myself  
Ain't tryna complain  
Just don't wanna explain it  
But  
Sometimes I don't wanna be happy  
Don't hold it against me  
If I'm down just leave me there  
Let me be sad  
Sometimes I just wanna be lonely  
Don't need you to hold me  
If I'm low you don't need to care  
Let me be sad  
What's the matter with that  
Oh oh oh  
What's the matter with that  
Oh oh oh  
What's the matter with sadness  
Making me feel the way I feel right now  
Goodness  
Can't force you when you feel f**ked up  
It's the salt that's on my tongue  
It's the salt that's on my tongue  
But  
Sometimes I don't wanna be happy  
Don't hold it against me  
If I'm down just leave me there  
Let me be sad  
Sometimes I just wanna be lonely  
Don't need you to hold me  
If I'm low you don't need to care  
Let me be sad  
What's the matter with that  
Oh oh oh  
What's the matter with that  
Oh oh oh  
Just let me be sad
