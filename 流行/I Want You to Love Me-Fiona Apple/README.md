**I Want You to Love Me** 是美国女歌手Fiona Apple的歌曲，收录在其第五张录音室专辑《Fetch The Bolt
Cutters》中。

专辑命名为Fetch the Bolt
Cutters，灵感来自于英国电视剧《秋天》。这张专辑里的曲子，已经离开标准流行歌曲的范畴，但没有奇怪到失去“好听”的宝贵品质，像是约翰•列侬和小野洋子夫妇的结合作品。节奏是专辑的第一推动力，各式各样的打击乐器像风吹过屋顶悬挂的串串铁皮罐，无曲亦成乐。菲奥娜•艾波边唱，边敲打晃动，爱和连接爱的冲动直接变成她的音乐骨架。节奏蓝调、嘻哈乐、爵士乐，听众可以在这张作品中辨识出种种风格，但它们都已经过充分消化，脱胎成为独具菲奥娜•艾波气质的音符。

### I Want You to Love Me歌词：

I've waited many years  
Every print I left upon the track, has led me here  
And next year, it'll be clear  
This was only leading me to that  
And by that time, I hope that  
You love me  
You love me  
I move with the trees, in the breeze  
I know that time is elastic  
And I know when I go  
All my particles disband and disperse  
And I'll be back in the pulse  
And I know none of this, will matter in the long run  
But I know a sound, is still a sound around no one  
And while I'm in this body, I want somebody to want  
And I want, what I want and I want  
You to love me  
You  
And I know that you do  
In the dark, I know that you do  
And I know, that you know that you got  
The potential to pick me up  
And I want you to use it  
Blast the music  
Bang it, bite it, bruise it  
Whenever you want to begin, begin  
We don't have to go back to where we've been  
I am the woman who wants you to win, and I've been  
Waiting, waiting for  
You to love me  
You  
You
