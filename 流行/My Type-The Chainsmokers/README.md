**My Type双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_My Type_ 是美国电子音乐组合The Chainsmokers的歌曲。The Chainsmokers又称烟鬼组合，由安德鲁•塔格特（Andrew
Taggart） 和亚历克斯•鲍尔（Alex Pall）组成。

烟鬼组合在创作和制作两方面都做得十分精致，作为一个EDM组合，他们的强项其实并不是对EDM曲风的革命性开拓和创造。他们更像是一个流行小清新的EDM组合，注重的是作品的旋律性，音色的入耳度，整个氛围的舒适与体验，以及最重要的流行性。专注于音乐独特口味的打造外，烟鬼还偏好发掘小众歌手，找到自己音乐在人声方面的支点，用许多绿叶，来衬托自己红红火火的EDM。所以，在烟鬼身上可以看到“庸众”崛起的场面，所谓“庸众”并非贬义，而是指那些暂时没有获得更多关注的实力派。

### My Type歌词：

You don't gotta say it  
I know you ain't staying over  
And I won't even mention the fact that you're never sober  
I never know which side I'm gonna get tonight  
And the closer we get  
The less I think I know ya  
But you're just my type  
The kind that only calls me late at night  
You can't decide if you'll be yours or mine  
I hate to say it but you're just my type  
Ya you're just my type  
Yeah yeah  
Just my type  
Yeah you're just my type  
Yeah yeah  
Just my type  
Yeah you're just my type  
Yeah yeah  
And I'm fooling myself 'cause I know that I'll never change ya  
But you told me the truth  
So I guess I can't really blame ya  
No you're not the one  
But you're all I want  
Yeah  
People say I'll get hurt  
I don't know what they're so afraid of  
But you're just my type  
The kind that only calls me late at night  
You can't decide if you'll be yours or mine  
I hate to say it but you're just my type  
Ya you're just my type  
Yeah yeah  
Just my type  
Yeah you're just my type  
Yeah yeah  
Just my type  
Yeah you're just my type  
Yeah yeah  
But you're just my type  
The kind that only calls me late at night  
You can't decide if you'll be yours or mine  
I hate to say it but you're just my type  
Ya you're just my type  
Yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah  
Just my type  
Hate to say it  
But you're just my type  
Yeah yeah  
Just my type  
Yeah you're just my type  
Yeah yeah  
My type  
Oh I hate to say it but you're just my type  
My type  
Oh I hate to say it but you're just my type
