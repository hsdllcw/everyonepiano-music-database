### How Do I Say Goodbye歌词：

Early mornin'  
There's a message on my phone  
It's my mother saying "Darlin' please come home"  
I fear the worst  
But how could you leave us all behind  
There's so much to say but there's so little time  
So how do I say goodbye  
To someone's who's been with me for my whole d**n life  
You gave me my name and the colour of your eyes  
I see your face when I look at mine  
So how do I how do I how do I say goodbye  
When I couldn't  
You always saw the best in me  
Right or wrong you were always on my side  
But I'm scared  
Of what life without you's like  
And I saw the way she looked into your eyes  
And I promised if you go  
I will make sure she's alright  
So how do I say goodbye  
To someone's who's been with me for my whole d**n life  
You gave me my name and the colour of your eyes  
I see your face when I look at mine  
So how do I how do I how do I say goodbye  
And there's no way you could ever let me down  
Gonna steal some time and start again  
You'll always be my closest friend  
And someday we are gonna make it out  
Just hold the light just hold the light  
So how do I say goodbye  
To someone's who's been with me for my whole d**n life  
You gave me my name and the colour of your eyes  
I see your face when I look at mine  
So how do I how do I how do I say goodbye  
So how do I how do I how do I say goodbye
