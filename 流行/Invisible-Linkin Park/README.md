_Invisible_ 是Linkin Park新专辑One More Light的第四首单曲。

林肯公园（Linkin
Park）是一组来自美国加利福尼亚州的摇滚乐队，由乐队主唱查斯特•贝宁顿，麦克•信田、贝斯手菲尼克斯•法雷尔、吉他手布莱德•德尔森、鼓手罗伯•巴登和DJ采样手约瑟夫•韩组成。林肯公园，新世代的音乐顽童，无门无派，嬉笑怒骂游走于各门各派之间，博采众家之长，是这个时代独一无二的混种音乐霸王。林肯公园认为“混合理论”就是乐队努力的目标，乐风融入另类摇滚、嘻哈节奏、炫丽的电子乐等元素，成为了摇滚乐E世代的精神堡垒[35]

### Invisible歌词：

I've got an aching head  
Echoes and buzzing noises  
I know the words we said  
But wish I could've turned our voices down  
This is not black and white  
Only organized confusion  
I'm just trying to get it right  
And in spite of all I should've done  
I was not mad at you  
I was not trying to tear you down  
The words that I could've used  
I was too scared to say out loud  
If I cannot break your fall  
I'll pick you up right off the ground  
If you felt invisible, I won't let you feel that now  
Invisible  
Invisible  
Invisible  
Invisible  
You didn't get your way  
And it's an empty feeling  
You've got a lot to say  
And you just want to know you're being heard  
But this is not black and white  
There are no clear solutions  
And I'm just trying to get it right  
And in spite of all I should've done  
I was not mad at you  
I was not trying to tear you down  
The words that I could've used  
I was too scared to say out loud  
If I cannot break your fall  
I'll pick you up right off the ground  
If you felt invisible, I won't let you feel that now  
Invisible  
Invisible  
Invisible  
Invisible  
This is not black and white  
There are no clear solutions  
I'm just trying to get it right  
And in spite of all I should've done  
I was not mad at you  
I was not trying to tear you down  
The words that I could've used  
I was too scared to say out loud  
If I cannot break your fall  
I'll pick you up right off the ground  
If you felt invisible, I won't let you feel that now  
Invisible  
Invisible  
Invisible  
Invisible  
Invisible  
Invisible  
Invisible  
Invisible
