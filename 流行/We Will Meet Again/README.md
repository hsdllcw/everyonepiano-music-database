### We'll Meet Again歌词：

Suddenly you're nowhere to be found  
I turn around and everything has changed  
Looking for a way to work it out  
I'm tryna to find some peace to navigate  
The oak tree  
Where I met you  
And the writing  
On the statue  
I still remember every word you said  
I'm not a soldier  
But I'm fighting  
Can you hear me through the silence  
I won't give up cause  
There will be a day  
We'll meet again  
We'll meet again  
Everything we wanted turned to gold  
The path we chose the future on our side  
Never thought I'd do this on my own  
But now I wield the sword you left behind  
The oak tree  
Where I met you  
And the writing  
On the statue  
I still remember every word you said  
I'm not a soldier  
But I'm fighting  
Can you hear me through the silence  
I won't give up cause  
There will be a day  
We'll meet again We'll meet again  
Dark for the sunrise  
Clouds for a blue sky  
Space for the travelling star  
Strong from the inside  
You're still my life-line  
I feel you wherever you are  
The oak tree  
Where I met you  
And the writing  
On the statue  
I still remember every word you said  
I'm not a soldier  
But I'm fighting  
Can you hear me through the silence  
I won't give up cause  
There will be a day  
We'll meet again  
We'll meet again  
We'll meet again
