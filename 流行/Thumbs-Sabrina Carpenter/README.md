### Thumbs歌词：

Somewhere in the world there is a father and a mother  
And the father is a son, who has a mother  
The mother has a daughter who gets married to the brother of a mother  
And they all just tryna multiply with one another

'Cause that's just the way of the world  
It never ends till the end, then you start again  
That's just the way of the world  
That's just the way of the world

Somewhere in the world they think they're working for themselves  
They get up everyday to go to work for someone else  
And somebody works for them and so they think they've got it made  
But they're all just working to get paid the very same

And so they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs  
Skiddly-dee-da-dum  
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs  
Skiddly-dee-da-dum-dum  
And so they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs  
Skiddly-dee-da-dum  
(Skiddly-dee-da-dum)  
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs  
Skiddly-dee-da-dum-dum

Somewhere in the world you got a robber and a bank  
And the bank robbed the people, so the people rob the bank  
And the police came to get him but they let him get away  
'Cause they're all just workin' to get paid the very same

'Cause that's just the way of the world  
It never ends till the end, then you start again  
That's just the way of the world  
That's just the way of the world

And so they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs  
Skiddly-dee-da-dum  
(Skiddly-dee-da-dum)  
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs  
Skiddly-dee-da-dum-dum  
And so they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs  
Skiddly-dee-da-dum  
(Skiddly-dee-da-dum)  
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs  
Skiddly-dee-da-dum-dum

Don't believe everything that you hear  
Let it go through your left and right ear  
Don't just march to the beat of that drum  
Don't be one of them people just twiddlin' them thumbs

'Cause that's just the way of the world  
It never ends till the end and then you start again  
That's just the way of the world  
That's just the way of the world

And so they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs  
Skiddly-dee-da-dum  
(Skiddly-dee-da-dum)  
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs  
Skiddly-dee-da-dum-dum  
And so they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs  
Skiddly-dee-da-dum  
(Skiddly-dee-da-dum)  
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs  
Skiddly-dee-da-dum-dum

And so they keep on twiddling them thumbs  
Skiddly-dee-da-dum  
They gonna keep on twiddling them thumbs  
Skiddly-dee-da-dum-dum  
'Cause that's just the way of the world
