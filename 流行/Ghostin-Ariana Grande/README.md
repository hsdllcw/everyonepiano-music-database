### Ghostin歌词：

I know you hear me when I cry  
I try to hold it in at night  
While you're sleepin' next to me  
But it's your arms that I need this time this time  
Look at the cards that we've been dealt  
If you were anybody else  
Probably wouldn't last a day  
Every tear's a rain parade from hell from hell  
Baby you do it so well  
You been so understanding you been so good  
And I'm puttin' you through more than one ever should  
And I'm hating myself 'cause you don't want to  
Admit that it hurts you  
I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again  
Over him mmh  
I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again  
'Stead of ghostin' him  
We'll get through this we'll get past this I'm a girl with  
A whole lot of baggage  
But I love you we'll get past this I'm a girl with  
A whole lot of baggage oh yeah  
Though I wish he were here instead  
Don't want that living in your head  
He just comes to visit me  
When I'm dreaming every now and then and then  
And after all that we been through and after all that we been through  
There's so much to look forward to  
What was done and what was said  
Leave it all here in this bed with you with you  
Baby you do it so well  
You been so understanding you been so good  
And I'm puttin' you through more than one ever should  
And I'm hating myself 'cause you don't want to  
Admit that it hurts you baby  
I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again  
Over him mmh  
I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again  
'Stead of ghostin' him  
We'll get through this we'll get past this I'm a girl with  
A whole lot of baggage  
But I love you we'll get past this I'm a girl with  
A whole lot of baggage yeah
