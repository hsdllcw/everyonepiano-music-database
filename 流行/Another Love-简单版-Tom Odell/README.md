### Another Love歌词：

I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care  
But it's so cold and I don't know where  
I brought you daffodils in a pretty string  
But they won't flower like they did last spring  
And I wanna kiss you make you feel alright  
I'm just so tired to share my nights  
I wanna cry and I wanna love  
But all my tears have been used up  
On another love another love  
All my tears have been used up  
On another love another love  
All my tears have been used up  
On another love another love  
All my tears have been used up  
And if somebody hurts you I wanna fight  
But my hands been broken one too many times  
So I'll use my voice I'll be so f**king rude  
Words they always win but I know I'll lose  
And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours  
But I sang 'em all to another heart  
And I wanna cry I wanna learn to love  
But all my tears have been used up  
On another love another love  
All my tears have been used up  
On another love another love  
All my tears have been used up  
On another love another love  
All my tears have been used up  
I wanna sing a song that'd be just ours  
But I sang 'em all to another heart  
And I wanna cry I wanna fall in love  
But all my tears have been used up  
On another love another love  
All my tears have been used up  
On another love another love  
All my tears have been used up  
On another love another love  
All my tears have been used up
