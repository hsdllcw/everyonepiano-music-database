**Arms** 是美国创作女歌手Christina
Perri的第二首打榜单曲。在第13期的billboard榜单中，首周登录#97，遗憾的是，仅仅登陆一周便出榜。

  
相比于Jar Of
Hearts，Arms的节奏明快很多，曲调轻盈，却不与饱满的感情相冲突。民谣风格的曲调里，鼓声时隐时现，听觉元素丰富，是一首快热、慢腻的富有灵气的小作品。

  
如果 _Arms_ 变化成为一幅画面，那一定是盛夏时节里，涓涓细流边上的一片果林； 如果Arms是能嗅到的气息，那感觉，一定也是酸酸甜甜的吧。
戴上耳机，开车、旅行、跑步,想象着自己正奔向中意之人的怀抱吧。相比之前风格较为相似的几首单曲，Arms在一定程度上有所突破。

### Arms歌词：

I never thought that you would be the one to hold my heart  
But you came around and you knocked me off the ground from the start

You put your arms around me  
And I believe that it's easier for you to let me go  
You put your arms around me and I'm home

How many times will you let me change my mind and turn around?  
I can't decide if I'll let you save my life or if I'll drown

I hope that you see right through my walls  
I hope that you catch me 'cause I'm already falling  
I'll never let a love get so close  
You put your arms around me and I'm home

The world is coming down on me and I can't find a reason to be loved  
I never wanna leave you but I can't make you bleed if I'm alone

You put your arms around me  
And I believe that it's easier for you to let me go...

I hope that you see right through my walls  
I hope that you catch me, 'cause I'm already falling  
I'll never let a love get so close  
You put your arms around me and I'm home

I tried my best to never let you in to see the truth  
And I've never opened up  
I've never truly loved 'til you put your arms around me  
And I believe that it's easier for you to let me go

I hope that you see right through my walls  
I hope that you catch me, 'cause I'm already falling  
I'll never let a love get so close  
You put your arms around me and I'm home

You put your arms around me and I'm home
