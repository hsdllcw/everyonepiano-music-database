### Shotgun Rider歌词：

Horses are running wide open, I just gotta ride  
To those honky tonk bars that stay open way past closing time  
Songs about free thinkin' and drinking sure light my fire  
That flame leaves a scar on my heart like an old branding iron

She said, "Rodeo man, where are you going?  
Don't you know that the life of a cowboy is no good alone?  
If you tear down that fence of rusty barbed wire  
Then I'll lay down beside you and be your shotgun rider"

Yesterday's nothing but dust I brush off my boots  
While I'm wearing out roads don't you know that I'm sure missing you?  
When I leave you'll be wondering when I'll be back again  
Between Texas and ranchers and old friends where do you fit in?

She said, "Rodeo man, where are you going?  
Don't you know that the life of a cowboy is no good alone?  
If you tear down that fence of rusty barbed wire  
Then I'll lay down beside you and be your shotgun rider"

Hey, rodeo man, where are you going?  
Don't you know that the life of a cowboy is no good alone?  
If you tear down that fence of rusty barbed wire  
Then I'll lay down beside you and be your shotgun rider

Woman, come lay down beside me  
And be my shotgun rider
