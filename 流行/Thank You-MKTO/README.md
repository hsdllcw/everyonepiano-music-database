Thank You歌词：

  
Yo, this one right here  
Is for all the drop out-of-schoolers  
The future cougars  
The Mary Jane abusers  
The ones that chose to be losers  
For all the misfit kids and the total outcasts  
MKTO  
This one's for you  
Role models  
We are the ones  
The ones you left behind  
Don't tell us how  
Tell us how to live our lives  
Ten million strong  
We're breaking all the rules  
Thank you for nothing  
Cause there's nothing left to lose  
Thank you for feeding us years of lies  
Thank you for the wars you left us to fight  
Thank you for the world you ruined over night  
But we'll be fine  
Yeah we'll be fine  
Thank you for the world you broke  
Like yolk and it ain't no joke  
So cold and there ain't no coat  
Just me, my friends, my folks, and  
We gonna do what we like  
So raise that bird up high  
And when they ask you why  
Just stand there laugh and smile  
We are the ones  
The ones you left behind  
Don't tell us how  
Tell us how to live our lives  
Ten million strong  
We're breaking all the rules  
Thank you for nothing  
Cause there's nothing left to lose  
Na na na na  
Na na na na na na  
Na na na na  
Na na na na na na  
Thank you for the times you said don't make a sound  
Thanks for the ropes you used to hold us down  
Cause when I break through  
I'ma use them to reach the clouds  
We ain't comin' down  
We ain't comin' down  
Look Ma I finally made it  
This world is too damn jaded  
My life is just like Vegas  
Go big, go home, get faded  
Been a prob since '92  
Can't shut me down curfew  
And them girls I'll take a few  
Do what I wanna do  
We are the ones  
The ones you left behind  
Don't tell us how  
Tell us how to live our lives  
Ten million strong  
We're breaking all the rules  
Thank you for nothing  
Cause there's nothing left to lose  
Na na na na  
Na na na na na na  
Na na na na  
Na na na na na na  
Na na na na  
Na na na na na na  
Na na na na  
Na na na na na  
  
Thank you from the bottom of my heart  
From head to toe, from the soul you ripped apart  
I say thank you  
I say thank you  
  
Thank you（We are the ones）  
The ones you left behind （Thank you）  
Don't tell us how （Thank you）  
Tell us how to live our lives （Yeah...）  
Ten million strong  
We're breaking all the rules （Yeah...）  
Thank you for nothing （Yeah）  
Cause there's nothing left to lose  
We are the ones  
The ones you left behind  
Don't tell us how  
Tell us how to live our lives  
Ten million strong  
We're breaking all the rules  
Thank you for nothing  
Cause there's nothing left to lose  
Yo, if you don't like what they tell you to do  
Don't do it  
If you don't want to be who they want you to be  
Screw it  
It's your world  
It's your life  
And they ruined it  
Role models  
Tune in  
Turn up  
Drop out
