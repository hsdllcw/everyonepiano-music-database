### Angel歌词：

Congratulations  
You've been pretending to be human  
So well  
Might even fool the neighbors  
Reading your Sunday papers  
I won't tell  
But I know better than to  
Bring up the weather with you  
And talk about the rain  
After you fall asleep I'll  
Kiss both your eyes and cheeks  
I know we're not the same  
You're an angel  
In disguise  
You're an angel  
In my eyes  
I bought a house to live in  
But you're the home I'm missin'  
I know  
Nothing good lasts forever  
But nights with you are better  
So go slow  
I never knew I needed you  
Before I found you for the first time hmm  
I'm out of step I'm off my feet  
I'm waking up inside a dream  
Teach me how to fly  
You're an angel  
In disguise  
You're an angel  
In my eyes  
Ah ah woo woo  
Ah ah woo woo  
You're an angel  
In my eyes  
You're an angel  
Are you mine mine mine  
Tonight  
Tonight
