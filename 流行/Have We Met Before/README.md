### Have We Met Before歌词：

You sat down right at the corner of my table  
I don't know what it is but I swear I'm feeling déjà vu  
Black cup of coffee and a book you're skimming over  
You're a stranger but feel closer and when I'm looking at you  
Swear I feel you in my memory  
I think I've seen you in my dreams  
Maybe you and I have history  
But I don't think you know me  
Have we met before  
Maybe in another life I knew you  
Maybe if I try I'll see right through you  
And I'll remember who we were  
Have we met before  
Maybe in another time I loved you  
Maybe you're the one that I would run to  
Don't know why it's all a blur  
I think I know you  
I think I know you  
I sat down right at the corner of your table  
For some reason I thought maybe we had been right here before  
Can't concentrate I just keep reading the same pages  
And I don't know how to say it but I wanna know you more  
Swear I feel you in my memory  
I think I've seen you in dreams  
Maybe you and I have history  
But I don't think you know me  
Have we met before  
Maybe in another life I knew you  
Maybe if I try I'll see right through you  
And I'll remember who we were  
Have we met before  
Maybe in another time I loved you  
Maybe you're the one that I would run to  
Don't know why it's all a blur  
I think I know you  
I think I know you  
Think I know you  
I think I know you
