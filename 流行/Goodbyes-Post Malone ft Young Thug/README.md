### Goodbyes歌词：

Post Malone：  
Me and Kurt feel the same too much pleasure is pain  
My girl spites me in vain all I do is complain  
She needs something to change need to take off the e-e-edge  
So f**k it all tonight  
And don't tell me to shut up  
When you know you talk too much  
But you don't got s**t to say-ay-ay  
Say  
I want you out of my head  
I want you out of my bedroom tonight  
Bedroom  
There's no way I could save you  
Save you  
'Cause I need to be saved too  
I'm no good at goodbyes  
We're both actin' insane but too stubborn to change  
Now I'm drinkin' again 80 proof in my veins  
And my fingertips stained looking over the e-e-edge  
Don't f**k with me tonight  
Say you needed this heart then you got it  
Got it  
Turns out that it wasn't what you wanted  
Wanted  
And we wouldn't let go and we lost it  
Now I'm a goner  
I want you out of my head  
Head  
I want you out of my bedroom tonight  
Bedroom  
There's no way I could save you  
Save you  
'Cause I need to be saved too  
Saved too  
I'm no good at goodbyes  
Young Thug：  
I want you right in my life  
I want you back here tonight  
I'm tryna cut you no knife  
I wanna slice you and dice you  
My heart get possessive it got you precise  
Can you not turn off the TV I'm watchin' the fight  
My flooded Girard blue diamond on shock  
You poppin' life doll it's Nicki Minaj  
You don't need a key to drive your car on a charger  
I just wanna see the side the one that's unbothered  
And I don't want ya to never go outside  
Outside  
I promise if they play my n***as slidin'  
Slidin'  
I'm f**kin' in it too but still ridin'  
Ridin'  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Post Malone：  
I want you out of my head  
I want you out of my bedroom tonight  
There's no way I could save you  
Save you  
'Cause I need to be saved too  
Saved too  
I'm no good at goodbyes  
Post Malone/Young Thug：  
Goodbye goodbye goodbye  
Goodbye goodbye goodbye  
Goodbye goodbye goodbye  
I'm no good at goodbyes  
Goodbye goodbye goodbye  
Goodbye goodbye goodbye  
Goodbye goodbye goodbye  
I'm no good at goodbyes
