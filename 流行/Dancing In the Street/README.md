### Dancing In the Street歌词：

Callin' out around the world  
Are you ready for a brand new beat  
Summer's here and the time is right  
For dancing in the street (dancing in the street)  
They're dancing in Chicago (dancing in the street)  
Down in New Orleans (dancing in the street)  
In New York City (dancing in the street)  
All we need is music, sweet music (sweet sweet sweet sweet music)  
There'll be music everywhere (sweet music everywhere)  
There'll be swingin' and swayin' and records playing and (oooohhhhh)  
Dancing in the street (dancing in the street)  
Oh it doesn't matter what you wear (ooohhh)  
Just as long as you are there  
So come on every guy grab a girl  
Everywhere around the world  
They'll be dancing, dancing in the street (dancing in the street [x2])  
This is an invitation across the nation (ooohhh)  
A chance for folks to meet  
There'll be laughing,and singing, and music swinging  
And Dancing in the street (dancing in the street)  
Philadelphia, PA (dancing in the street)  
Baltimore and D.C. now (dancing in the street)  
Can't forget the Motor City (dancing in the street)  
All we need is music, sweet music (sweet sweet sweet sweet music)  
There'll be music everywhere (sweet music everywhere)  
There'll be swingin' (swingin') and and swayin' (swayin'), and records playing  
And dancing in the street (dancing in the street)  
Oh it doesn't matter what you wear (ooohhh)  
Just as long as you are there  
So come on every guy grab a girl  
Everywhere around the world  
There'll be dancing, (ooohh)  
Dancing in the street (dancing in the street)  
Way down in L.A. (dancing in the street)  
Every day (ooohh)  
Dancing in the street (dancing in the street)  
Let's form a big strong line (dancing in the street)  
Get in time (dancing in the street)  
We're dancing in the street (dancing in the street)  
Across the ocean blue, me and you (dancing in the street)  
We're dancing in the street
