### 24 Hours歌词：

All it'd take is 24 hours  
Sign the check and the place is ours  
It's a little soon  
But I wanna come home to you  
I don't know how does it go  
I promise that I love you  
So I'll bet it all on me and you  
I'll bet it all you're bulletproof  
Let's throw away our backup plans  
And people might not understand  
Who cares about if they approve  
I'd face them all to be with you  
All it'd take is 24 hours  
Sign the check and the place is ours  
It's a little soon  
But I wanna come home to you  
All it'd take is 24 hours  
We could dance you could throw the flowers  
It's a little soon  
But I wanna come home to you  
I heard that once a wise man said  
"Only fools go rushing in"  
But I'm not the type to overthink  
When something feels so right  
And I promise I mean every word  
I'll paint the world that you deserve  
Every color you'd imagine  
I can't wait for it to happen 'cause  
All it'd take is 24 hours  
Sign the check and the place is ours  
It's a little soon  
But I wanna come home to you  
All it'd take is 24 hours  
We could dance you could throw the flowers  
It's a little soon  
But I wanna come home to you  
I heard that once a wise man said  
"Only fools go rushing in"  
But I'm not the type  
I'm not the type  
To overthink  
Overthink  
I'm not the type to overthink  
All it'd take is 24 hours  
Sign the check and the place is ours  
It's a little soon  
But I wanna come home to you  
All it'd take is 24 hours  
Sign the check and the place is ours  
It's a little soon  
But I wanna come home to you
