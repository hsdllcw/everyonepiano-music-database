### Talk Dirty歌词：

Jason, ha ha  
Jason Derulo…  
(Ha ha)  
Get jazzy on me  
I’m the flight that you get on, international  
First class seat on my lap girl  
Riding comfortable, cause I know what the girl them need  
New york to Haiti, I got lipstick stamps for my passport  
You make it hard to leave  
Been around the world, don’t speak the language  
But your booty don’t need explaining  
All I really need to understand is when you, you talk dirty to me  
Talk dirty to me, talk dirty to me, talk dirty to me  
Get jazzy on me  
You know the worst in my songs, no habla ingles  
Our conversation ain’t no, but you know what is  
I know what that girl them wants, london to taiwan  
I got lipstick stamps for my passport, I think I need a new one  
Been around the world, don’t speak the language  
But your booty don’t need explaining  
All I really need to understand is when you, you talk dirty to me  
Talk dirty to me, talk dirty to me, talk dirty to me  
UNO, met a friend in rio  
DOS, she was all on me-oh  
TRES, we can make now a trio  
CUATRO, oh…  
Dos Cadenas, close to genius  
Sold out arenas, you can suck my penis  
Gilbert Arenas, guns on deck. Chest to chest, tongue on neck.  
International oral sex, every picture I take I pose a threat  
Bought a jet, what you expect?  
Her pussy's so good, I bought her a pet.  
Anyway, every day I'm trying to get to it  
Got it saved in my phone, under big booty.  
Anyway, every day I'm trying to get to it  
Got it saved in my phone, under big booty.  
Been around the world, don’t speak the language  
But your booty don’t need explaining  
All I really need to understand is when you, you talk dirty to me  
Talk dirty to me, talk dirty to me, talk dirty to me  
Get jazzy on me
