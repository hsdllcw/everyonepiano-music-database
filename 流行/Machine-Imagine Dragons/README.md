### Machine歌词：

All my life been sittin' at the table  
Watchin' them kids they're living in a fable  
Looks luck money and never left a'wishin'  
But now it's 'bout time to raise up and petition  
All my life been sittin' at the table  
Watching them kids they're living in a fable  
Looks luck money and never left a'wishin'  
Now it's 'bout time to stand up and petition  
'Cause I've been wondering  
When you gonna see I'm not for sale  
I've been questioning  
When you gonna see I'm not a part of your machine  
Not a part of your machine  
I'm not scared of what you're gonna tell me  
And I'm not scared of the beast in the belly  
Fill my cup with endless ambition  
And paint this town with my very own vision  
I'm not scared of what you're gonna tell me  
And I'm not scared of the beast in the belly  
Fill my cup with endless ambition  
And paint this town with my very own vision  
'Cause I've been wondering  
When you gonna see I'm not for sale  
I've been questioning  
When you gonna see I'm not a part of your machine  
Not a part of your machine  
I am the machine  
I am the machine  
'Cause I've been wondering  
When you gonna see I'm not for sale  
I've been questioning  
When you gonna see I'm not a part of your machine  
Not a part of your machine  
'Cause I've been wondering  
When you gonna see I'm not for sale  
I've been questioning  
When you gonna see I'm not a part of your machine  
Not a part of your machine  
I am the machine
