### Chemical歌词：

Oxytocin making it all ok  
When I come back down it doesn't feel the same  
Now I'm sitting around waiting for the world to end all day  
Cuz I couldn't leave you if I tried  
You break me then I break my rules  
Last time was the last time too  
It's ****** up I know but I'm still  
Outside of the party smoking in the car with you  
Seven nation army fighting at the bar with you  
Tell you that I'm sorry  
Tell me what I gotta do  
Cuz I can't let go  
It's chemical  
No I can't let go  
It's chemical  
Every time I'm ready to make a change  
You turn around and **** out all my brains  
I ain't tryna fight fate  
It's too late to save face  
I can't get away  
Maybe there's no mistakes  
You break me the I break my rules  
Last time was the last time took  
It's ****** up I know but I'm still  
Outside of the party smoking in the car with you  
Seven nation army fighting at the bar with you  
Tell you that I'm sorry  
Tell me what I gotta do  
Cuz I can't let go  
It's chemical  
No I can't let go  
It's chemical  
No I can't let go  
It's chemical  
I can't let go  
It's chemical  
Tell you that I'm sorry  
Tell me what I gotta do  
No I can't let go  
It's chemical
