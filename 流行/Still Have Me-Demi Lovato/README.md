**Still Have Me** 是美国流行乐女歌手Demi Lovato演唱的歌曲。发行于2020年9月30日。

据说，这首歌曲Demi早都已经写好了，但是最近改了一些歌词部分，大概内容就是一个关于分手的歌曲，而这或许也直接暗示了她与未婚夫分手传闻的真实性。

### Still Have Me歌词：

Hmm  
I'm a mess and I'm still broken  
But I'm finding my way back  
Hmm  
And it feels like someone's stolen  
All the light I ever had  
Hmm  
Like the world disappeared  
And I'm laying right here  
While the silence is piercing  
And it hurts to breathe  
I don't have much but at least I still have me  
I still have me  
And that's all I need  
So take my faith but at least I still believe  
I still believe  
And that's all I need  
I don't have much but at least I still have me  
Everything around me shattered  
All the highs are now just low  
Hmm  
But it doesn't even matter  
'Cause I'd rather be alone  
Hmm  
All my love disappeared  
And I'm laying right here  
While the silence is piercing  
And it hurts to breathe  
I don't have much but at least I still have me  
I still have me  
And that's all I need  
So take my faith but at least I still believe  
I still believe  
And that's all I need  
I don't have much but at least I still have me  
Woah woah  
I don't have much but at least I still have me  
I don't have much but at least I still have me  
I still have me  
And that's all I need  
That's all I need  
So take my faith but at least I still believe  
I still believe  
And that's all I need  
That's all I need  
I don't have much but at least I still have me  
Ooh hmm
