### Red Lights歌词：

Blacked out, everything's faded  
On your love I’m already wasted  
So close that I can taste it now... now...

So let’s break right out of these gilded cages  
We’re gonna make it now...  
Don’t ever turn around  
Don’t ever turn around

Nobody else needs to know  
Where we might go...  
We could just run them red lights  
We could just run them red lights

There ain’t no reason to stay  
We’ll be light years away...  
We could just run them red lights  
We could just run them red lights

We could just run them red lights...  
We could just run them red lights...

White lights, flirt in the darkness  
This road leads where your heart is  
These signs, something we can’t ignore...no...

We can’t back down  
We’ll never let them change us  
We’re gonna make it now  
What are we waiting for...  
What are we waiting for...

Nobody else needs to know  
Where we might go...  
We could just run them red lights  
We could just run them red lights

There ain’t no reason to stay  
We’ll be light years away...  
We could just run them red lights  
We could just run them red lights

We could just run them red lights...  
We could just run them red lights...
