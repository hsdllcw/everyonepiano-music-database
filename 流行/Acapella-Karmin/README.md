### Acapella歌词：

Used to be your baby, used to be your lady  
Thought you were the perfect lover  
All the harmony went fallin' out of key, so  
Now you gotta find another  
Now you're talkin' crazy, sayin' that you made me  
Like I was your Cinderella  
You and me are through though, watch me hit it solo  
I'mma do it acapella, yeah  
I'mma do it acapella, yeah  
Once upon a time, I met the perfect guy  
He had that Colgate smile, he had that suit & tie  
Mama always said "get a rich boyfriend,  
You don't gotta love 'em, girl, you can pretend"  
You bet I totes believed her, yeah, every word she said  
Thought he was gluten-free, but all that I got was bread  
Mama always said "nice guys finish last,  
Beat him at his own game, honey, take the cash"  
Ooh, and what a lucky girl you will be  
But no, he didn't do jack for me  
I want a bean with the beanstalk  
And if the magic ain't right, time to walk  
Used to be your baby, used to be your lady  
Thought you were the perfect lover  
All the harmony went fallin' out of key, so  
Now you gotta find another  
Now you're talkin' crazy sayin' that you made me  
Like I was your Cinderella  
You and me are through though, watch me hit it solo  
I'mma do it acapella, yeah  
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
I'mma do it acapella, yeah  
Out on our first date, he took me gourmet  
We hit that Olive Garden, my Little Italy  
Daddy always said "let the gentleman pay,  
Never ever go Dutch at the buffet"  
I saw his bad intention, he didn't wanna talk  
He put the saucy on it (Oops!) time to check my watch  
Daddy always said "money can't buy class,  
You don't wanna get stuck takin' out trash"  
Ooh, and yeah I guess it wasn't meant to be  
Because he didn't do jack for me  
I want a bean with the beanstalk  
And if the magic ain't right, time to walk  
Used to be your baby, used to be your lady  
Thought you were the perfect lover  
All the harmony went fallin' out of key, so  
Now you gotta find another  
Now you're talkin' crazy sayin' that you made me  
Like I was your Cinderella  
You and me are through though, watch me hit it solo  
I'mma do it acapella  
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
I'mma do it acapella  
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
Watch me do it in falsetto  
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
Never mind, bring the beat back  
Used to be your baby, used to be your lady  
Thought you were the perfect lover  
All the harmony went fallin' out of key, so  
Now you gotta find another  
Now you're talkin' crazy sayin' that you made me  
Like I was your Cinderella  
You and me are through though, watch me hit it solo  
I'mma do it acapella  
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
I'mma do it acapella, yeah
