### Bounce Man歌词：

You should bounce bounce bounce man  
Come to the house man I'll let my old lady know  
You'll be in and out out out man  
Float you a couple bands then you head to Mexico  
I'll let my old lady know then you head to Mexico  
I don't know if you've got your phone  
'Cause this went straight to voicemail  
And my wife saw your face on the nightly news  
Oh boy what'd you do  
Don't matter now  
If you need a piece I'll break it down  
You should bounce bounce bounce man  
Come to the house man I'll let my old lady know  
You'll be in and out out out man  
Float you a couple bands then you head to Mexico  
Yeah I told you all along running away don't make you wrong  
Before you bounce bounce bounce man  
Come to the house man we'll sing one more song  
So long  
I'll let my old lady know  
So long  
Then you head to Mexico  
If they come knocking  
Pop pop pop  
Ain't no stopping me for you  
Just let me know you're good on your amenities  
Got soldiers on my pedigree  
If you don't reply  
If you don't  
I'll know you must have crossed state lines  
She's been crying but I'll tell her you're fine  
Don't matter now  
If you need a piece I'll break it down  
Break it down  
You should bounce bounce bounce man  
Come to the house man I'll let my old lady know  
You'll be in and out out out man  
Float you a couple bands then you head to Mexico  
Yeah I told you all along running away don't make you wrong  
Before you bounce bounce bounce man  
Come to the house man we'll sing one more song  
So long  
I'll let my old lady know  
So long  
Then you head to Mexico  
Yeah I told you all along running away don't make you wrong  
Before you bounce bounce bounce man  
Come to the house man we'll sing one more song  
So long
