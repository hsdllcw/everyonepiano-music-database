### Mockingbird歌词：

Yeah I know sometimes  
Things may not always make sense to you right now  
But hey what'd Daddy always tell you  
Straighten up little soldier  
Stiffen up that upper lip  
What you cryin' about you got me  
Hailie I know you miss your mom  
And I know you miss your dad when I'm gone  
But I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had  
I can see you're sad even when you smile even when you laugh  
I can see it in your eyes deep inside you wanna cry  
Cause you're scared I ain't there  
Daddy's with you in your prayers  
No more crying wipe them tears  
Daddy's here no more nightmares  
We gon' pull together through it we gon' do it  
Lainie Uncle's crazy ain't he  
Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it  
We're all we got in this world  
When it spins when it swirls when it whirls when it twirls  
Two little beautiful girls  
Looking puzzled in a daze I know it's confusing you  
Daddy's always on the move  
Momma's always on the news  
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems  
The harder that I try to do that the more it backfires on me  
All the things growing up as Daddy that he had to see  
Daddy don't want you to see  
But you see just as much as he did  
We did not plan it to be this way your mother and me  
But things have got so bad between us  
I don't see us ever being together ever again  
Like we used to be when we was teenagers  
But then of course everything always happens for a reason  
I guess it was never meant to be  
But it's just something we have no control over  
And that's what destiny is  
But no more worries rest your head and go to sleep  
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream  
Hook  
Now hush little baby don't you cry  
Everything's gonna be alright  
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady I told ya  
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night  
I know Mommy's not here right now  
And we don't know why  
We fear how we feel inside  
It may seem a little crazy pretty baby  
But I promise Momma's gon' be alright  
Heh it's funny  
I remember back one year when Daddy had no money  
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up  
And stuck 'em under the tree  
And said some of 'em were from me  
Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em  
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night cryin'  
Cause Daddy felt like a bum see Daddy had a job  
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom  
And at the time every house that we lived in  
Either kept getting broken into and robbed or shot up on the block  
And your mom was saving money for you in a jar  
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college  
Almost had a thousand dollars  
'Til someone broke in and stole it  
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart  
And it seemed like everything was just starting to fall apart  
Mom and Dad was arguing a lot  
So Momma moved back on to Chalmers  
In the flat one bedroom apartment  
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara  
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD  
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Momma out to see me  
But Daddy had to work you and momma had to leave me  
Then you started seeing Daddy on the TV  
And Momma didn't like it  
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it  
Papa was a rolling stone Momma developed a habit  
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it  
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand  
Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud  
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house  
Just reminiscing looking at your baby pictures it just trips me out  
To see how much you both have grown  
It's almost like you're sisters now  
Wow guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here  
Lainie I'm talking to you too daddy's still here  
I like the sound of that yeah it's got a ring to it don't it  
Sssshhh Momma's only gone for the moment  
Now hush little baby don't you cry  
Everything's gonna be alright  
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady I told ya  
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night  
I know Mommy's not here right now  
And we don't know why  
We fear how we feel inside  
It may seem a little crazy pretty baby  
But I promise Momma's gon' be alright  
And if you ask me to Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird  
I'ma give you the world  
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you I'ma sing for you  
I'll do anything for you to see you smile  
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine  
I'ma break that birdie's neck  
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya  
And make him eat every carat don't f**k with Dad ha ha
