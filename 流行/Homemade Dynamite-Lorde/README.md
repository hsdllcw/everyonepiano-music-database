### Homemade Dynamite歌词：

A couple rebel Top Gun pilots  
Flying with nowhere to be  
Don't know you super well,  
But I think that you might be the same as me  
Behave abnormally  
Let's let things come out of the woodwork  
I'll give you my best side  
Tell you all my best lies  
Yeah, awesome right?  
So let's let things come out of the woodwork  
I'll give you my best side  
Tell you all my best lies  
Seeing me rolling, showing someone else love  
Dancing with our shoes off  
Know I think you're awesome, right?  
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind  
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite  
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired  
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite  
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite  
Might get your friend to drive,  
But he can hardly see  
We'll end up painted on the road  
Red and chrome, all the broken glass sparkling  
I guess we're partying  
So let's let things come out of the woodwork  
I'll give you my best side  
Tell you all my best lies  
Seeing me rolling, showing someone else love  
Hands under your T-shirt  
Know I think you're awesome, right?  
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind  
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite  
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired  
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite  
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite  
Now you know it's really gonna blow (bhoo)  
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind  
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite  
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired  
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite  
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite  
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite  
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind  
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite  
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired  
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
