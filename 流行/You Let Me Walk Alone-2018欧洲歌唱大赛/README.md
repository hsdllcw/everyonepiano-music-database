### You Let Me Walk Alone歌词：

I'm a dreamer, a make believer  
我幻想一切，天马行空  
I was told that you were, too  
他们说你也这样  
I love the silence and the clear horizon  
我喜爱寂静，明晰视界  
And I got that all from you  
这都是源自于你  
Every now and then I'm drawn to places  
无时不刻都受你吸引  
Where I hear your voice or see your face  
你的音容总萦绕身边  
And every little thought will lead me right back to you  
丝丝点点都令我想你  
I was born from one love of two hearts  
两颗心有爱让我降临  
We were three kids and a loving mum  
还有爱你的妻儿陪伴  
You made this place a home  
是你让这个家园坚韧  
A shelter from the storm  
躲避外面的风吹雨打  
You said I had one life and a true heart  
你曾说用真心活一次  
I tried my best and I came so far  
我拼尽全力不负希冀  
But you will never know  
可你却永远不会知道  
'Cause you let me walk this road alone  
因你不在，我踽踽独行  
My childhood hero will always be you  
儿时的偶像，一直是你  
And no one else comes close  
从未有人能匹敌  
I thought you'd lead me when life's misleading  
我曾想有你，带我前行  
That's when I miss you most  
我最祈盼这画面  
Every now and then I'm drawn to places  
无时不刻都受你吸引  
Where I hear your voice or see your face  
你的音容总萦绕身边  
And every little thought will lead me right back to you  
丝丝点点都令我想你  
I was born from one love of two hearts  
两颗心有爱让我降临  
We were three kids and a loving mum  
还有爱你的妻儿陪伴  
You made this place a home  
是你让这个家园坚韧  
A shelter from the storm  
躲避外面的风吹雨打  
You said I had one life and a true heart  
你曾说用真心活一次  
I tried my best and I came so far  
我拼尽全力不负希冀  
But you will never know  
可你却永远不会知道  
'Cause you let me walk this road alone  
因你不在，我独自前进  
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh  
I was born from one love of two hearts  
两颗心有爱让我降临  
We were three kids and a loving mum  
还有爱你的妻儿陪伴  
You made this place a home  
是你让这个家园坚韧  
A shelter from the storm  
躲避外面的风吹雨打  
You said I had one life and a true heart  
你曾说用真心活一次  
I tried my best and I came so far  
我拼尽全力不负希冀  
But you will never know  
可你却永远不会知道  
'Cause you let me walk this road alone  
因你不在，我多么孤单
