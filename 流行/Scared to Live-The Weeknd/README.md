### Scared to Live歌词：

When I saw the signs I shoulda let you go  
Yeah yeah  
But I kept you beside me  
And if I held you back at least I held you close  
Yeah  
Should have known you were lonely  
I know things will never be the same  
Time we lost will never be replaced  
I'm the reason you forgot to love  
So don't be scared to live again  
Be scared to live again  
No don't be scared to live again  
Be scared to live again  
You always miss the chance to fall for someone else  
Uh uh  
'Cause your heart only knows me  
They try to win your love but there was nothing left  
Uh  
They just made you feel lonely  
Hey  
I am not the man I used to be  
Did some things I couldn't let you see  
Refuse to be the one who taints your heart  
So don't be scared to live again  
Be scared to live again  
No don't be scared to live again  
Be scared to live again  
Hey  
I hope you know that I hope you know that  
I've been praying that you find yourself  
I hope you know that I hope you know that  
We fell apart right from the start  
I should have made you my only  
When it's said and done  
So don't be scared to live again  
Be scared to live again  
I said don't be scared to live again  
Be scared to live again  
Oh  
I hope you know that I hope you know that  
I've been praying that you find yourself  
I hope you know that I hope you know that  
We fell apart right from the start
