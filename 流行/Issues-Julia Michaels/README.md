### Issues歌词：

I'm jealous, I'm overzealous  
When I'm down, I get real down  
When I'm high, I don't come down  
I get angry, baby, believe me  
I could love you just like that  
And I could leave you just as fast  
But you don't judge me  
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too  
No, you don't judge me  
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too  
'Cause I got issues  
But you got 'em too  
So give 'em all to me  
And I'll give mine to you  
Bask in the glory  
Of all our problems  
'Cause we got the kind of love  
It takes to solve 'em  
Yeah, I got issues  
And one of them is how bad I need you  
You do shit on purpose  
You get mad and you break things  
Feel bad, try to fix things  
But you're perfect  
Poorly wired circuit  
And got hands like an ocean  
Push you out, pull you back in  
'Cause you don't judge me  
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too  
No, you don't judge me  
'Cause you see it from the same point of view  
'Cause I got issues  
But you got 'em too  
So give 'em all to me  
And I'll give mine to you  
Bask in the glory  
Of all our problems  
'Cause we got the kind of love  
It takes to solve 'em  
Yeah, I got issues  
And one of them is how bad I need you  
(I got issues, you got 'em too)  
And one of them is how bad I need you  
(I got issues, you got 'em too)  
'Cause I got issues  
(I got)  
But you got 'em too  
So give 'em all to me  
(You got 'em too)  
And I'll give mine to you  
Bask in the glory  
(I got issues)  
Of all our problems  
'Cause we got the kind of love  
(You got 'em too)  
It takes to solve 'em  
Yeah, I got issues (I got)  
And one of them is how bad I need you (You got 'em too)  
Yeah, I got issues (I got issues)  
And one of them is how bad I need you (You got 'em too)  
Yeah, I got issues (I got)  
And one of them is how bad I need you
