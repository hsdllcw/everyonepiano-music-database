### The One歌词：

Ill be the one  
I guess you were lost when I met you  
Still there were tears in your eyes  
So out of trust and I knew  
No more than mysteries and lies  
There you were wild and free  
Reachin out like you needed me  
A helping hand to make it right  
I am holding you all through the night  
Chorus  
Ill be the one  
Who will make all your sorrows undone  
Ill be the light  
When you feel like theres nowhere to run  
Ill be the one  
To hold you and make sure that youll be all right  
Cause my faith is gone  
And I want to take you from darkness to light  
There you were wild and free  
Reachin out like you needed me  
A helping hand to make it right  
I am holding you all through the night  
Chorus  
Ill be the one  
Who will make all your sorrows undone  
Ill be the light  
When you feel like theres nowhere to run  
Ill be the one  
To hold you and make sure that youll be all right  
You need me like I need you  
We can share our dreams comin true  
I can show you what true love means  
Just take my hand baby please  
Ill be the one  
Ill be the light  
Where you can run  
To make it all right  
Ill be the one  
Ill be the light  
Where you can run  
Chorus  
Ill be the one  
Who will make all your sorrows undone  
Ill be the light  
When you feel like theres nowhere to run  
Ill be the one  
Ill be the one  
Ill be the light  
Where you can run  
To make it all right  
Ill be the light  
Ill be the one  
Ill be the light  
Where you can run  
To make it all right  
Ill be the one  
To hold you  
And make sure that youll be all right  
Ill be the one
