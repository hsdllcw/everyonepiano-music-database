Walking in Memphis歌词：

  
Put on my blue suede shoes  
And I boarded the plane  
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues  
In the middle of the pouring rain  
W.C. Handy -- won\'t you look down over me  
Yeah I got a first class ticket  
But I\'m as blue as a boy can be  
  
Then I\'m walking in Memphis  
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale  
Walking in Memphis  
But do I really feel the way I feel  
  
Saw the ghost of Elvis  
On Union Avenue  
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland  
Then I watched him walk right through  
Now security they did not see him  
They just hovered \'round his tomb  
But there\'s a pretty little thing  
Waiting for the King  
Down in the Jungle Room  
  
Then I\'m walking in Memphis  
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale  
Walking in Memphis  
But do I really feel the way I feel  
  
They\'ve got catfish on the table  
They\'ve got gospel in the air  
And Reverend Green be glad to see you  
When you haven\'t got a prayer  
But boy you\'ve got a prayer in Memphis  
  
Now Muriel plays piano  
Every Friday at the Hollywood  
And they brought me down to see her  
And they asked me if I would --  
Do a little number  
And I sang with all my might  
And she said --  
\"Tell me are you a Christian child?\"  
And I said \"Ma\'am I am tonight\"  
  
Then I\'m walking in Memphis  
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale  
Walking in Memphis  
But do I really feel the way I feel  
  
Then I\'m walking in Memphis  
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale  
Walking in Memphis  
But do I really feel the way I feel  
  
Put on my blue suede shoes  
And I boarded the plane  
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues  
In the middle of the pouring rain  
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues  
In the middle of the pouring rain
