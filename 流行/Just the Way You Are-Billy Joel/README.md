### Just the Way You Are歌词：

Don't go changing, to try and please me  
You never let me down before  
Don't imagine you're too familiar  
And I don't see you anymore  
I would not leave you in times of trouble  
We never could have come this far  
I took the good times, I'll take the bad times  
I'll take you just the way you are

Don't go trying some new fashion  
Don't change the color of your hair  
You always have my unspoken passion  
Although I might not seem to care

I don't want clever conversation  
I never want to work that hard  
I just want someone that I can talk to  
I want you just the way you are.

I need to know that you will always be  
The same old someone that I knew  
What will it take 'till you believe in me  
The way that I believe in you.

I said I love you and that's forever  
And this I promise from my heart  
I couldn't love you any better  
I love you just the way you are.
