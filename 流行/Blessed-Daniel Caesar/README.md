### Blessed歌词：

Everywhere that I go everywhere that I be  
If you were not surrounding me with your energy  
I don't wanna be there don't wanna be anywhere  
Any place that I can't feel you  
I just wanna be near you  
And yes I'm a mess but I'm blessed  
To be stuck with you  
Sometimes it gets unhealthy  
We can't be by ourselves we  
We'll always need each other and  
Yes I'm a mess but I'm blessed  
To be stuck with you  
I just want you to know that  
If I could I swear I'll go back  
Make everything all better whoa  
It's the things that you say  
It's the way that you pray  
Pray on my insecurities  
I know you're feeling me  
I know sometimes I do wrong  
But hear the words of this song  
When I go I don't stay gone for long  
Don't know what's going on  
And yes I'm a mess but I'm blessed  
To be stuck with you  
Sometimes it gets unhealthy  
We can't be by ourselves we  
We'll always need each other and  
Yes I'm a mess but I'm blessed  
To be stuck with you  
I just want you to know that  
If I could I swear I'll go back  
Make everything all better whoa  
And I'm coming back home to you  
And I'm coming back home to you  
I'm coming back home  
I'm coming back home to you  
I'm coming back home  
I'm coming back home to you  
I'm coming back home  
I'm coming back home to you  
I'm coming back home  
I'm coming back home to you  
I'm coming back home  
I'm coming back home to you  
I'm coming back home  
And yes I'm a mess but I'm blessed  
To be stuck with you  
Sometimes it gets unhealthy  
We can't be by ourselves we  
We'll always need each other and  
Yes I'm a mess but I'm blessed  
To be stuck with you  
I just want you to know that  
If I could I swear I'll go back  
Make everything all better whoa
