**Whistle** 是美国饶舌歌手Flo Rida的歌曲。Flo Rida本名Tramar
Dillard，生于1979年9月17号，出生地为美国佛罗里达，carol市。其在舞台上的名字Flo Rida更为大多数人所熟悉，注意Flo
Rida的发音不同于佛罗里达，正确发音为/'fl?: ‘raid?/，是美国著名的嘻哈说唱歌手，年轻时曾是当地的嘻哈组合2 Live Crew的一员。  
  
《 _Whistle_
》，凭着上耳的曲调，于2012年8月荣登Billboard单曲榜首位。这首足以让美女们卖力吹响口中哨的《Whistle》，以清脆吉他播弦和口哨声拉启序幕，由麦当娜、黑眼豆豆指定鬼才
DJ Frank-E 监控，走着中板的舒缓舞曲旋律，记载令人脸红心跳的故事，绝对是乐事一件。另外，《Whistle》将收录在他第四张专辑《Only One
Rida (Part 2)》 中。（与《Only One Flo (Part 1)》两个专辑的最后单词放在一起，是Flo Rida的名字)。

### Whistle歌词：

can you blow my whistle baby whistle baby  
let me know

and we start real slow  
you just put your lips together  
and you come real close
