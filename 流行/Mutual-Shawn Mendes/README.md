**Mutual双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Mutual_ 出自加拿大流行男歌手Shawn Mendes的同名专辑Shawn
Mendes。这首歌绝对是整张专辑里面最骚气的，Mutual里有浓浓的猹的味道，Shawn应该是被猹的新专感染了，听了几百遍，还是被撩到。Shawn
Mendes给人的印象就像是无公害水果。除鲜嫩可人，各种养眼，还安全无毒副作用。尤其那亲切而又略显矜持的笑容，更像邻家男孩。他的声线干净如晨露，让人感觉纯静，却又隐带甘甜。看似舒缓，但激情爆发处，有着让人欲罢不能的节奏感。

### Mutual歌词：

I want you close to me  
I want you close I want you closer  
But when you're here with me  
It's hard to tell just what you're after  
You say you want all of me today  
But tomorrow's not the same  
My feelings never change  
What do you want from me  
What do you want uh  
I need to know  
If this is mutual  
Before I go  
And get way too involved  
I want you bad  
Can you reciprocate  
No I don't want to have to leave  
But half of you is not enough for me  
It's inconsistency  
What doesn't mean you got me questioning  
The way you act and take it back do not mean anything  
Just tell me honestly  
You say you want all of me today  
But tomorrow's not the same  
My feelings never change  
What do you want from me  
What do you want uh  
I need to know  
If this is mutual  
Before I go  
And get way too involved  
I want you bad  
Can you reciprocate  
No I don't want to have to leave  
But half of you is not enough for me  
Are you playing me  
Is this a game  
When you show up late  
Say love at 2 am  
Then tell me you can't say  
Girl yeah  
What do you want from me  
Baby ohhh I need to know  
If this is mutual  
Before I go  
And get way too involved  
I want you bad baby  
Can you reciprocate  
No I don't want to have to leave  
But half of you's not enough for me
