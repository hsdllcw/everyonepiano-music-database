### Higher Love歌词：

Think about it  
There must be higher love  
Down in the heart or hidden in the stars above  
Without it life is wasted time  
Look inside your heart and I look inside mine  
Things look so bad everywhere  
In this whole world what is fair  
We will walk the line and try to see  
Falling behind in what could be  
Bring me a higher love  
Bring me a higher love  
Bring me a higher love  
Where's that higher love  
I keep thinking of  
Bring me a higher love love  
Bring me a higher love  
Bring me a higher love love  
Bring me a higher love  
Bring me a higher love love  
Bring me a higher love  
Bring me a higher love love  
Bring me a higher love  
Worlds are turning  
And we're just hanging on  
Facing our fear and standing out there alone  
A yearning and it's real to me  
There must be someone who's feeling for me  
Things look so bad everywhere  
In this whole world what is fair  
We will walk the line and try to see  
Falling behind in what could be  
Bring me a higher love  
Bring me a higher love  
Bring me a higher love  
Where's that higher love  
I keep thinking of  
Bring me a higher love love  
Bring me a higher love  
Bring me a higher love love  
Bring me a higher love  
Bring me a higher love  
Bring me a higher love  
Bring me a higher love  
Bring me bring me a higher love love  
I keep thinking of  
Bring me a higher love love  
Bring me a higher love  
Bring me a higher love love  
A higher love  
I keep thinking of  
Bring me a higher love  
Bring me a higher love
