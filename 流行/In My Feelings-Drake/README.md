### In My Feelings歌词：

Drake：  
Trap TrapMoneyBenny  
This sh*t got me in my feelings  
Gotta be real with it yup  
Drake：  
Kiki do you love me  
Are you riding  
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me  
'Cause I want ya and I need ya  
And I'm down for you always  
KB do you love me  
Are you riding  
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me  
'Cause I want ya and I need ya  
And I'm down for you always  
Drake：  
Look the new me is really still the real me  
I swear you gotta feel me before they try and kill me  
They gotta make some choices they runnin' out of options  
'Cause I've been goin' off and they don't know when it's stoppin'  
And when you get to toppin' and I see that you've been learnin'  
And when I take you shoppin' you spend it like you earned it  
And when you popped off on your ex he deserved it  
I thought you were the one from the jump that confirmed it  
TrapMoneyBenny  
I buy you Champagne but you love some Henny  
From the block like you Jenny  
I know you special girl 'cause I know too many  
Drake：  
'Resha do you love me  
Are you riding  
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me  
'Cause I want ya and I need ya  
And I'm down for you always  
J.T. do you love me  
Are you riding  
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me  
'Cause I want ya and I need ya  
And I'm down for you always  
City Girls/Drake/Magnolia Shorty：  
Two bad b**ches and we kissin' in the Wraith  
Kissin'-kissin' in the Wraith kiss-kissin' in the Wraith  
I need that black card and the code to the safe  
Code to the safe code-code to the safe-safe  
I show him how that neck work  
F**k that Netflix and chill what's your net-net-net worth  
'Cause I want ya and I need ya  
And I'm down for you always  
Yea yea yea yea he back  
And I'm down for you always  
Yea yea yea guess who's back  
And I'm down for you always  
D-d-down for you down for you always  
I got a new boy and that n**ga trade  
Drake：  
Kiki do you love me  
Are you riding  
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me  
'Cause I want you and I need you  
And I'm down for you always  
KB do you love me  
Are you riding  
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me  
'Cause I want ya and I  
Lil Wayne/Magnolia Shorty：
