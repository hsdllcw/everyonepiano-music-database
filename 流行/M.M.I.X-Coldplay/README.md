### M.M.I.X歌词：

Somewhere up above the stars  
The wreckage of a universe floats past  
Somewhere up above my heart  
A tiny little seed is sown,  
A government is overthrown,  
Who knows when we'll be coming home at last  
And I heard it on the radio  
That one day we'll be living in the stars  
And I heard it on a tv show  
That somewhere up above  
And in my heart  
They'll be tearing us apart,  
Maybe moving us to mars  
Past the satellites and stars,  
Maybe moving us to mars  
We won't see the earth again  
In these seconds just remain unchanged  
8 to 9, 9 to 10  
We are meeting for the first time  
We might never meet again you and me  
We are meeting for the first time  
Can't you see  
76543  
We are meeting for the first time  
Singing this space symphony  
They'll be tearing us apart moving us to mars,  
Past the satellites and stars  
They're moving us to mars
