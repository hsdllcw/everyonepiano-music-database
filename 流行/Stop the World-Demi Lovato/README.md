### Stop the World歌词：

I don't know why, I don't know why I'm so afraid  
I don't know how, I don't know how to fix the pain  
We're livin' a lie, livin' a lie; this needs to change  
We're out of time, we're out of time and its still the same

We can't stop the world, but there's so much more that we could do  
You can't stop this girl from falling more in love with you  
You said 'nobody has to know',  
Give us time to grow, and take it slow  
But I'd stop the world, if it'd finally let us be alone  
Let us be alone

I'm hearing the noise, hearing the noise from all around  
I'm on the edge, I'm on the edge of breaking down  
Like Bonnie and Clyde, let's find a ride, and ditch this town  
To keep it alive, keep it alive, don't make a sound

We can't stop the world, but there's so much more that we could do  
You can't stop this girl from falling more in love with you  
You said 'nobody has to know',  
Give us time to grow, and take it slow  
But I'd stop the world, if it'd finally let us be alone  
Let us be alone  
Never wanna take that final look  
I'll turn another page, won't close the book

We can't stop the world, but there's so much more that we could do  
You can't stop this girl from falling more in love with you  
You said 'nobody has to know',  
Give us time to grow, and take it slow  
But I'd stop the world, if it'd finally let us be alone  
Let us be alone  
Let us be alone  
(Let us be alone)  
Let us be alone
