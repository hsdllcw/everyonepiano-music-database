### Break Up with Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored歌词：

You got me some type of way  
Hmm  
Ain't used to feelin' this way  
Mmm-mmm  
I do not know what to say  
Yeah yeah  
But I know I shouldn't think about it  
Took one f**kin' look at your face  
Hmm  
Now I wanna know how you taste  
Mmm-mmm  
Usually don't give it away  
Yeah yeah  
But you know I'm out here thinkin' 'bout it  
Then I realize she's right there  
And I'm at home like "d**n this ain't fair"  
Break up with your girlfriend  
Girlfriend  
Yeah yeah 'cause I'm bored  
You could hit it in the mornin'  
Mornin'  
Yeah yeah like it's yours  
I know it ain't right  
But I don't care

Why can't we just play for keeps  
Mmm-mmm  
Practically on my knees  
Yeah yeah  
But I know I shouldn't think about it  
You know what you're doin' to me  
You're singin' my songs in the streets yeah yeah  
Actin' all innocent please  
When I know you out here thinkin' 'bout it  
Then you realize she's right there  
Yeah  
And you're at home like "d**n she can't compare"  
Break up with your girlfriend

Say I'm trippin' if you feel like  
But you without me ain't right
