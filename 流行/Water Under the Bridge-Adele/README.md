**Water Under the Bridge**
是由英国流行歌手Adele演唱的一首歌曲，是Adele新专辑《25》中的第6首歌曲。专辑《25》于2015年11月20日发行，这张专辑有Ryan
Tedder和冠单制造机Max Martin参与制作，一共有11首新歌。

Adele这张专辑销量的逆生长，对整个音乐产业来讲，其实只是一个特例，而没有任何能够复制的可能性。在一个缺乏超级巨星的时代，Adele以唱功、歌曲、演唱等几大纯音乐的元素而赢得听众。尤其是将个人的情绪，唱出一种大歌的效果，而这种雅俗共赏的大气，恰恰是这个崇尚个性却缺乏共性的时代最为缺少的音乐气质。另一方面，Adele虽然年轻，但她主打的并不是年轻人的市场。

### Water Under the Bridge歌词：

If you're not the one for me  
Then how come I can bring you to your knees  
If you're not the one for me  
Why do I hate the idea of being free?  
And if I'm not the one for you  
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do  
Oh honey if I'm not the one for you  
Why have we been through what we have been through

It's so cold out here in your wilderness  
I want you to be my keeper  
But not if you are so reckless

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently  
Don't pretend that you don't want me  
Our love ain't water under the bridge  
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently  
Don't pretend that you don't want me  
Our love ain't water under the bridge  
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

What are you waiting for?  
You never seem to make it through the door  
And who are you hiding from?  
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run  
Have I ever asked for much?  
The only thing that I want is your love

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently  
Don't pretend that you don't want me  
Our love ain't water under the bridge  
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently  
Don't pretend that you don't want me  
Our love ain't water under the bridge  
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

It's so cold in your wilderness  
I want you to be my keeper  
But not if you are so reckless

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently  
Don't pretend that you don't want me  
Our love ain't water under the bridge  
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently  
Don't pretend that you don't want me  
Our love ain't water under the bridge

Say it ain't so, say it ain't so  
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so  
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so  
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so  
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge  
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so  
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so  
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so  
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so  
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge  
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
