### Thousand Miles歌词：

I know that look on your face  
You're coming my way you're coming my way tonight  
Here goes another mistake  
I know I'm gon' make I know I'm gon' make tonight  
Oh you should let it go you're better off alone  
Cause I'm about to f**k it up with you  
I know that look on your face  
You're coming my way you're coming my way tonight  
And I will never change  
I couldn't even if I wanted for you  
There's nothing left to say  
If I was you if I was you then I would stay  
A thousand miles away a thousand miles away  
It's hard to give it all up  
Tryna block you out but you're evading my thoughts  
And you got ten fingers wrapped around my heart  
Wish I could give you everything that you want  
But I won't no  
You should let it go you're better off alone  
Cause I'm about to f**k it up with you  
I know that look on your face  
You're coming my way  
Tomorrow we'll say goodbye  
And I will never change  
I couldn't even if I wanted for you oh  
There's nothing left to say  
If I was you if I was you then I would stay  
A thousand miles away a thousand miles away  
Here in your arms I'm already gone  
You got me wrong and I played along  
I know that look on your face  
You're coming my way you're coming my way tonight  
Here goes another mistake  
I know I'm gonna make I know I'm gonna make tonight  
And I will never change  
I couldn't even if I wanted for you  
There's nothing left to say  
If I was you if I was you then I would stay  
A thousand miles away a thousand miles away
