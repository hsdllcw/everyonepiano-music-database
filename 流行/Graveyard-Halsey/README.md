### Graveyard歌词：

It's crazy when  
The thing you love the most is the detriment  
Let that sink in  
You can think again  
When the hand you want to hold is a weapon and  
You're nothing but skin  
Oh cause  
I keep digging myself down deeper  
I won't stop till I get where you are  
I keep running  
I keep running  
I keep running  
They say  
I may be making a mistake  
I woulda followed all the way no matter how far  
I know  
When you go down all your darkest roads  
I woulda followed all the way to the graveyard  
Oh cause I keep digging myself down deeper  
I won't stop till I get where you are  
I keep running when both my feet hurt  
I won't stop till I get where you are  
Oh  
When you go down all your darkest roads  
I woulda followed all the way to the graveyard  
You look at me  
With eyes so dark don't know how you even see  
You push right through me  
It's getting real  
You lock the door you're drunk at the steering wheel  
And I can't conceal  
Oh cause  
I've been digging myself down deeper  
I won't stop till I get where you are  
I keep running  
I keep running  
I keep running  
They say  
I may be making a mistake  
I woulda followed all the way no matter how far  
I know  
When you go down all your darkest roads  
I woulda followed all the way to the graveyard  
Oh cause I keep digging myself down deeper  
I won't stop till I get where you are  
I keep running when both my feet hurt  
I won't stop till I get where you are  
Oh  
When you go down all your darkest roads  
I woulda followed all the way to the graveyard  
It's funny how  
The warning signs can feel like they're butterflies  
Oh cause  
I've keep digging myself down deeper  
I won't stop till I get where you are  
I keep running when both my feet hurt  
I won't stop till I get where you are  
Oh  
When you go down all your darkest roads  
I woulda followed all the way to the graveyard
