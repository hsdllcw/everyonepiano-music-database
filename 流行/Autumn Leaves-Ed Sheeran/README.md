### Autumn Leaves歌词：

Another day another life  
Passes by just like mine  
It's not complicated  
Another mind  
Another soul  
Another body to grow old  
It's not complicated  
Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?  
Float down  
Like autumn leaves  
Hush now  
Close your eyes before the sleep  
And your miles away  
And yesterday you were here with me  
Another tear  
Another cry  
Another place for us to die  
It's not complicated  
Another life that's gone to waste  
Another light lost from your face  
It's complicated  
Is it only wonder or do birds still sing for you?  
Float down  
Like autumn leaves  
Hush now  
Close your eyes before the sleep  
And your miles away  
And yesterday you were here with me  
Ooh how I miss you  
My symphony places the song that carries you out  
Ooh how I miss you  
I miss you and I wish you'd stay  
Is it any wonder that the stars shine out for you?  
Float down  
Like autumn leaves  
Hush now  
Close your eyes before the sleep  
And your miles away  
And yesterday you were here with me  
Float down  
Like autumn leaves  
Hush now  
Close your eyes before the sleep  
And your miles away  
And yesterday you were here with me  
Ooh oh, ooh oh  
Ooh oh, ooh oh  
Touch down  
Like a seven four seven  
Stay out and we'll live forever now
