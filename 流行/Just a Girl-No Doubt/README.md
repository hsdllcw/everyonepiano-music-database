### Just a Girl歌词：

Take this pink ribbon off my eyes  
I'm exposed and it's no big surprise  
Don't you think I know exactly where I stand  
This world is forcing me to hold your hand

'Cause I'm just a girl, a little 'ol me  
Well don't let me out of your sight  
Oh I'm just a girl, all pretty and petite  
So don't let me have any rights

Oh...I've had it up to here!

The moment that I step outside  
So many reasons for me to run and hide  
I can't do the little things I hold so dear  
'Cause it's all those little things that I fear

'Cause I'm just a girl I'd rather not be  
'Cause they won't let me drive late at night  
Oh I'm just a girl, guess I'm some kind of freak  
'Cause they all sit and stare with their eyes

Oh I'm just a girl, take a good look at me  
Just your typical prototype

Oh...I've had it up to here!

Oh...am I making myself clear?

I'm just a girl  
I'm just a girl in the world...  
That's all that you'll let me be!

I'm just a girl, living in captivity  
Your rule of thumb makes me worry some  
I'm just a girl, what's my destiny?  
What I've succumbed to is making me numb

Oh I'm just a girl, my apologies  
What I've become is so burdensome  
Oh I'm just a girl, lucky me  
Twiddle-dum there's no comparison

Oh...I've had it up to!  
Oh...I've had it up to!  
Oh...I've had it up to here!
