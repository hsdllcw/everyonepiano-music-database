### Ceilings歌词：

Ceilings plaster  
Can't you just make it move faster  
Lovely to be sitting here with you  
You're kinda cute but it's raining harder  
My shoes are now full of water  
Lovely to be rained on with you  
It's kinda cute but it's so short  
Then you're driving me home  
And I don't wanna leave  
But I have to go  
You kiss me in your car  
And it feels like the start of a movie I've seen before  
Before  
Bed sheets no clothes  
Touch me like nobody else does  
Lovely to just lay here with you  
You're kinda cute and I would say all of this  
But I don't wanna ruin the moment  
Lovely to sit between comfort and chaos  
But it's over  
Then you're driving me home  
And it kinda comes out as I get up to go  
You kiss me in your car  
And it feels like the start of a movie I've seen before  
But it's not real  
And you don't exist  
And I can't recall the last time I was kissed  
It hits me  
Hits me in the car  
And it feels like the end of a movie I've seen before  
Before
