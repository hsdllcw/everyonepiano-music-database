### Bed of Lies歌词：

Do you ever think of me, when you lie?  
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies  
And I knew better, than to look in your eyes  
They only pretend, you will be mine  
And you know how you made me, believe  
You had me caught in every web, that you weaved  
But do you ever think of me, when you lie?  
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies  
You could never make eye contact  
Everything you got was based off of my contacts  
You a fraud, but I*mma remain icon-stat  
Balenciaga*s on my boots with the python strap  
You was caught up in the rush, and you was caught up in the thrill of it  
You was with me way before, I hit a quarter mil* in it  
Put you in the crib and you ain*t never pay a bill in it  
I was killin* it, man you got me poppin* pills in it  
I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin*  
Cause I was doing it for us, I told em fuck the public  
Couldn*t believe that I was home alone, contemplating  
Overdosin*, no more postin*, no more toastin* over oceans  
They say you don*t know what you got *til it*s gone  
They say that your darkest hour comes before your dawn  
But there was something I should*ve asked all along  
I*mma ask on the song  
Do you ever think of me, when you lie?  
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies  
And I knew better, than to look in your eyes  
They only pretend, you will be mine  
And you know how you made me, believe  
You had me caught in every web, that you weaved  
But do you ever think of me, when you lie?  
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies  
I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes  
You*d remember our connection and be freed from the lies  
I just figured I was something that you couldn*t replace  
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn*t relate  
I just couldn*t understand and I couldn*t defend  
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn*t pretend  
When the tears roll down it*s like you ain*t even notice em  
If you had a heart, I was hoping you would*ve showed it some  
What the fuck you really telling me, what you telling me  
I could tell you lying, get the fuck out don*t yell at me  
I ain*t mean to cut you, I ain*t one to catch a felony  
This ain*t how to be a player, you ain*t Bill Bellamy  
They say you don*t know what you got till it*s gone  
They said that your darkest hour came before your dawn  
But there was something that I should*ve asked all along  
I*mma ask on the song  
So does she know I*ve been in that bed before  
A thousand count, and not a single threaded truth  
If I was just another girl  
Then I*m ashamed to say that I*m not over you  
There*s one thing I need to know  
So call me, when you*re not so busy just thinking of yourself  
Do you ever think of me, when you lie?  
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies  
And I knew better, than to look in your eyes  
They only pretend, you will be mine
