**New Year's Day双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_New Year's Day_ 是由美国创作型女歌手Taylor
Swift演唱的歌曲。该歌曲收录在泰勒•斯威夫特2017年11月10日发行的第六张录音室专辑《Reputation》中。

Reputation不仅是泰勒•斯威夫特的原创心血，更意味着她华丽转身，霸气回归，这张专辑就像是她给全世界的一张宣誓词。不同于过往色彩大胆、轻松跳跃的风格，此次专辑封面为黑白照片，显得较为压抑。照片中泰勒穿着一件露肩T恤，右半边脸部被各种印有她名字的报道字体覆盖，脖子上则是套着看起来有些过紧的链子，似乎在表达对外界给她“名声（Reputation）”的回应。2018年5月21日，该专辑获得公告牌音乐奖最佳畅销专辑奖。

### New Year's Day歌词：

There's glitter on the floor after the party  
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby  
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor  
You and me from the night before but  
Don't read the last page  
But I stay when you're lost and I'm scared  
And you're turning away  
I want your midnights  
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day  
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi  
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road  
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town babe  
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home  
Don't read the last page  
But I stay when it's hard or it's wrong  
Or we're making mistakes  
I want your midnights  
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day  
Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you  
Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you  
Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you  
And I will hold on to you  
Please don't ever become a stranger  
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere  
Please don't ever become a stranger  
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere  
There's glitter on the floor after the party  
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby  
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor  
You and me forevermore  
Don't read the last page  
But I stay when it's hard or it's wrong  
Or we're making mistakes  
I want your midnights  
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day  
Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you  
Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you  
Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you  
And I will hold on to you  
Please don't ever become a stranger  
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere  
Please don't ever become a stranger  
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
