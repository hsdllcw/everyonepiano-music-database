### Rose-Colored Boy歌词：

Low-key no pressure just hang with me and my weather  
Low-key no pressure just hang with me and my weather  
Rose-colored boy  
I hear you making all that noise  
About the world you want to see  
And oh I'm so annoyed  
'Cause I just killed off what was left of the optimist in me  
I had to break it the wars are raging on  
And I have taken my glasses off  
You got me nervous  
I'm right at the end of my rope  
A half empty girl  
Don't make me laugh I'll choke  
Just let me cry a little bit longer  
I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to  
Hey man we all can't be like you  
I wish we were all rose-colored too  
My rose-colored boy  
Low-key no pressure just hang with me and my weather  
I want you to stop insisting that I'm not a lost cause  
'Cause I've been through a lot  
Really all I've got is just to stay pissed off  
If it's all right by you  
I had to break it the wars are raging on  
And I have taken my glasses off  
You got me nervous  
And you're turning it into a joke  
A half empty girl  
Don't make me laugh I'll  
Just let me cry a little bit longer  
I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to  
Hey man we all can't be like you  
I wish we were all rose-colored too  
My rose-colored boy  
Leave me here a little bit longer  
I think I wanna stay in the car  
I don't want anybody seeing me cry now  
You say we gotta look on the bright side  
I say well maybe if you wanna go blind  
You say my eyes are getting too dark now  
But boy you ain't ever seen my mind  
Just let me cry a little bit longer  
I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to  
Hey man we all can't be like you  
I wish we were all rose-colored too  
My rose-colored boy  
Just let me cry a little bit longer  
I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to  
I know we all can't be like you  
I wish we were all rose-colored too  
My rose-colored boy  
Low-key no pressure just hang with me and my weather  
Low-key no pressure just hang with me and my weather
