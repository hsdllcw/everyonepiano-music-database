**New Age** 是英国歌手Marlon Roudette所演唱的一首歌曲。Marlon Roudette与Preetesh

Hop、摇滚、舞曲等，营造一个音乐无国界之概念。起初二人并不互相欣赏，直到碰头在录音室工作，激爆出的音乐火花，让Marlon及Preetesh讶异不已，从生长背景到乐种喜爱度，无不牵引着对方创作上之灵感。2010年4月，Mattafix宣布两人已经已经分开活动了。

### New Age歌词：

If love was a word, I don't understand.  
Simplest sound, four letters.  
Whatever it was, I'm over it now.  
With every day, it gets better (it gets better)

Are you loving the pain, loving the pain?  
And with everyday, everyday  
I try to move on.  
Whatever it was,  
Whatever it was,  
There's nothing now.  
You changed.  
New Age.

I'm walking away, From everything I had.  
I need a room with new colours.  
There was a time,  
When I didn't mind living the life of others.

Are you loving the pain, loving the pain?  
And with everyday, everyday  
I try to move on.  
Whatever it was,  
Whatever it was,  
There's nothing now.  
You changed.  
New Age.

So much fire that it burned my wings.  
Her heat was amazing.  
Now I'm dreaming of the simple things.  
Old ways, erased.  
If love was a word,  
I don't understand.  
The simplest sound,  
Four letters.

Are you loving the pain, loving the pain?  
And with everyday, everyday  
I try to move on.  
Whatever it was,  
Whatever it was,  
There's nothing now.  
You changed.  
New Age.

Loving the pain, loving the pain?  
And with everyday, everyday  
I try to move on.  
Whatever it was,  
Whatever it was,  
There's nothing now.  
You changed.  
New Age.
