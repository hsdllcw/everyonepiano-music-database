### Skin歌词：

When I heard that sound  
When the walls came down  
I was thinking about you  
About you  
When my skin grows old  
When my breath runs cold  
I'll be thinking about you  
About you

Seconds from my heart  
A bullet from the dark  
Helpless, I surrender  
Shackled by your love  
Holding me like this  
With poison on your lips  
Only when it's over  
The silence hits so hard

'Cause it was almost love, it was almost love  
It was almost love, it was almost love

When I heard that sound  
When the walls came down  
I was thinking about you  
About you  
When my skin grows old  
When my breath runs cold  
I'll be thinking about you  
About you

When I run out of air to breathe  
It's your ghost I see  
I'll be thinking about you, about you  
It was almost love, it was almost...

We bleed ourselves in vain  
How tragic is this game?  
Turn around, I'm holding on to someone  
But the love is gone  
Carrying the load, with wings that feel like stone  
Knowing that we nearly fell so far now  
It's hard to tell

Yeah we came so close, it was almost love  
It was almost love, it was almost love

When I heard that sound  
When the walls came down  
I was thinking about you  
About you  
When my skin grows old  
When my breath runs cold  
I'll be thinking about you  
About you

When I run out of air to breathe  
It's your ghost I see  
I'll be thinking about you, about you

While I reached out for your hand  
When the walls were caving in  
When I see you on the other side  
We can try all over again

When I heard that sound  
When the walls came down  
I was thinking about you  
About you  
When my skin grows old  
When my breath runs cold  
I'll be thinking about you  
About you

When I run out of air to breathe  
It's your ghost I see  
I'll be thinking about you, about you

'Cause it was almost love, it was almost love  
It was almost love, it was almost love
