### Let Me Down Slowly歌词：

Alec Benjamin：  
This night is cold in the kingdom  
I can feel you fade away  
From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and  
Your steps keep me awake  
Don't cut me down throw me out leave me here to waste  
I once was a man with dignity and grace  
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace  
So please please  
Could you find a way to let me down slowly  
A little sympathy I hope you can show me  
If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely  
If you're leaving baby let me down slowly  
Let me down down  
Let me down down  
Let me down let me down  
Down let me down down  
Let me down  
If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely  
If you're leaving baby let me down slowly  
Alessia Cara：  
I hold on to little pieces of what we were  
I know we're long gone but take it easy  
Because it hurts  
Don't cut me down throw me out leave me here to waste  
I once was a girl with dignity and grace  
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace  
So please please  
Could you find a way to let me down slowly  
A little sympathy I hope you can show me  
If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely  
If you're leaving baby let me down slowly  
Let me down down  
Let me down down  
Let me down let me down  
Down let me down down  
Let me down  
If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely  
If you're leaving baby let me down slowly  
Both：  
And I can't stop myself from falling down  
And I can't stop myself from falling down  
And I can't stop myself from falling down  
And I can't stop myself from falling down  
Both：  
Could you find a way to let me down slowly  
A little sympathy I hope you can show me  
If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely  
If you're leaving baby let me down slowly  
Let me down down  
Let me down down  
Let me down let me down  
Down let me down down  
Let me down  
If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely  
If you're leaving baby let me down slowly  
If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely  
If you're leaving baby let me down slowly
