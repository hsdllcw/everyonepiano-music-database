### Expectations歌词：

Up in bed all alone  
Wondering where you've been  
Ten past three  
I know the club closed at two A.M  
I've already been through about seven scenarios  
'Bout what it was that changed your mind  
Knowing very well that you told me you'd come home  
And it happens every time  
Wish I had no expectations  
I wish that I could get it through your head  
With no confrontation  
I really wish we could talk about it instead  
All these tears that I cry while I'm turned to the side  
And you're in the same f**king bed  
Wish I had no expectations  
But I expect you expect we expect  
No I don't mean to pry  
I don't need no play by play  
Nah  
All I need from your side is for you to communicate  
Respect for my time respect for my space respect for my energy  
'Cause I've been waiting here all night for you to warm me up  
And you haven't once thought of me  
Wish I had no expectations  
I really wish that I could get it through your head  
With no confrontation  
I really wish we could talk about it instead  
All these tears that I cry while I'm turned to the side  
And you're in the same f**king bed  
Wish I had no expectations  
But I expect you expect we expect  
Oh I wish I had no expectations  
I wish I could get through your head  
With no confrontation  
Confrontations  
I really wish we could talk about it instead  
Instead  
All these tears that I cry while I'm turned to the side  
And you're in the same f**king bed  
Wish I had no expectations  
No  
But I expect you expect we expect
