### Tough Love歌词：

Weight is on me  
Weight is on you  
We scream and we fight like there's nothing to lose  
End of the day  
Come and take my all  
There's no place I'd rather be than in your arms  
Weight is on you  
Weight is on me  
Sometimes I'm not who you want me to be  
God knows I try  
We stumble and we fall  
There's no place I'd rather be than in your arms  
Give me tough love  
And a lesson to learn  
Your tough love  
Is what I deserve  
Sweet tough love  
You're my pretty good luck charm  
There's no place I'd rather be than in your arms  
Weight is on you  
Weight is on me  
Sometimes I'm not who you want me to be  
God knows I try  
We stumble and we fall  
There's no place I'd rather be than in your arms  
Give me tough love  
And a lesson to learn  
Your tough love  
Is what I deserve  
Sweet tough love  
You're my pretty good luck charm  
There's no place I'd rather be than in your arms  
Give me tough love  
And a lesson to learn  
Your tough love  
Is what I deserve  
Sweet tough love  
You're my pretty good luck charm  
There's no place I'd rather be than in your arms
