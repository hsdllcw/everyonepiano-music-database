### Girl of My Dreams歌词：

Ace Lex got a full one  
Yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah  
And I know you're not no good for me but  
You look so good to me  
I don't need another broken heart or sleepless night  
God please guide me right she looks like  
The girl of my dreams yeah uh  
She looks like the girl of my  
She looks like the girl of my  
She looks like the girl of my dreams yeah  
She looks like the girl of my  
She looks like the girl of my yeah  
Devil in a dress angel in some Nike Airs  
I could've sworn I went to sleep and she was right here  
Don't know if I seen her in my dreams or my nightmares  
Think it was my nightmares  
And I think I need your love  
I don't need no one selfish  
Wonder if I give this girl my heart could she help it  
And you know she's an angel if you let her tell it  
Baby hot as hell she got kicked out of heaven  
You know I love them braces them big lips that red skin  
You know I love the faces she make when we sexing  
Can't get her off my mind if I tried my obsession  
Block both her numbers erased all our texts yeah  
I know you're not no good for me but  
You look so good to me yeah  
I don't need another broken heart or sleepless night  
God please guide me right she looks like  
The Ace Lex got a full one  
Yeah  
You look like the girl of my  
You look like the girl of my yeah  
And I know you're not no good for me but  
You look so good to me yeah  
I don't need another broken  
Heart or sleepless night  
God please guide me right she looks like  
The girl of my dreams yeah uh  
She looks like the girl of my  
She looks like the girl of my  
She looks like the girl of my dreams
