### Rodeo歌词：

(Day trip took it to 10 (Hey))  
Oh, here we go  
Please let me know  
Oh, before you go  
Don't leave me in the cold  
If I took you everywhere  
Then well you wouldn't know how to walk  
If I spoke on your behalf  
Then well you wouldn't know how to talk  
If I gave you everything and everything is what I bought  
I can take it all back  
I never cared about what you thought  
I don't mean to make you mad  
I don't like when you're upset  
I'ma call you later on  
Baby girl don't you forget  
I'ma take you from this party  
We might go and have some sex  
Or we'll do that later on  
Now we lit like cigarettes  
I thought you would stay with me  
I'm yours and you're mine I envy  
So what I'm gonna do?  
I don't have a clue about me without you  
Oh, here we go  
Please let me know  
Oh, before you go  
Don't leave me in the cold  
If I take you everywhere  
Then well you wouldn't know how to walk  
If I spoke on your behalf  
Then well you wouldn't know how to talk  
If I gave you everything  
And everything is what I bought  
I can take it all back  
I never cared about what you thought  
Look gunshot, gunshot  
Thought you heard about me, must not, must not  
Last nigga did me dirty, dirty  
Like a bathroom in a truck stop, truck stop  
Now my heart it feels like Brillo  
I'm hard like armadillo  
Can't be no nigga's ex  
I could only be his widow  
That's a fact, dressed in black  
My heart break, those who crank  
I be chilling watching Oxygen  
My favorite show is Snapped  
Now, you know how I get  
Everyday a foreign whip  
Rather see you in a hearse  
Than see you with some other bitch  
Huh, woo  
Oh, here we go  
Please let me know  
Oh, before you go  
Don't leave me in the col  
If I took you everywhere  
Then well you wouldn't know how to walk  
If I spoke on your behalf  
Then well you wouldn't know how to talk  
If I gave you everything  
And everything is what I bought  
I can take it all back  
I never cared about what you thought  
I thought you would stay with me  
I'm yours and you're mine I envy  
So what I'm gonna do?  
I don't have a clue about me without you
