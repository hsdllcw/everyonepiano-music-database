### How Would You Feel (Paean)歌词：

You are the one girl  
And you know that it's true  
I'm feeling younger  
Every time that I'm alone with you

We were sitting in a parked car  
Stealing kisses in the front yard  
We got questions we should not ask but

How would you feel, if I told you I loved you?  
It's just something that I want to do  
I'll be taking my time, spending my life  
Falling deeper in love with you  
So tell me that you love me too

In the summer, as the lilacs bloom  
Love flows deeper than the river  
Every moment that I spend with you  
We were sat upon our best friend's roof  
I had both of my arms round you  
Watching the sunrise replace the moon

How would you feel, if I told you I loved you?  
It's just something that I want to do  
I'll be taking my time, spending my life  
Falling deeper in love with you  
So tell me that you love me too

We were sitting in a parked car  
Stealing kisses in the front yard  
We got questions we shouldn't ask but

How would you feel, if I told you I loved you?  
It's just something that I want to do  
I'll be taking my time, spending my life  
Falling deeper in love with you  
So tell me that you love me too  
Tell me that you love me too  
Tell me that you love me too
