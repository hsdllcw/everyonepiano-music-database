**Use My Voice** 是格莱美奖加冕金属摇滚乐队Evanescence演唱的歌曲，收录在其第五张录音室专辑The Bitter
Truth中，发行于2020年8月14日。

长期以来评论家有各不相同的议论于Evanescence是一支摇滚还是金属乐队。很多人认为Evanescence的音乐成分中带有哥德元素，纽约时报与滚石杂志等刊物都认定Evanescence为哥德金属，同时新音乐快递与IGN等媒体则称他们为哥德摇滚，但是乐队自己并不这么认为。事实上，乐队中很多歌曲都注重了生活阴暗面的主题，比如失恋、孤独和死亡。有批评家认为Evanescence没有专心做自己的摇滚，而是趋向商业音乐，Amy则称Evanescence是把各种音乐杂揉表现出来的，她相信Evanescence具有独一无二的声音。

### Use My Voice歌词：

Cover my eyes and close my eyes  
Just long enough to stop the noise  
Go and take everything and throw it away  
But I will use my voice  
Drown every truth in an ocean of lies  
Label me a b***h because I dare to draw my own line  
Burn every bridge and build a wall in my way  
But I will use my voice  
Whether you like it or not you're gonna take what I got  
If we can't talk about it we just keep drowning in it  
Give me credit or not  
I give and I give a lot  
But don't you speak for me  
No don't you speak for me  
Nevermind me I'm a waste of your time  
Never gonna fit in the box that you need  
And I can read between the lines yeah  
Gather your friends and wave your gun in my face  
But I will use my voice  
Whether you like it or not you're gonna take what I got  
If we can't talk about it we just keep drowning in it  
Give me credit or not  
I give and I give a lot  
But don't you speak for me  
But don't you speak for me  
Whether you like it or not  
Whether you like it or not  
Whether you like it or not  
Whether you like it or not  
One day soon it's gonna fall back on you  
No more lies we're gonna break right through  
Like it or not  
If we can't talk about it we just keep drowning in it  
Give me credit or not  
I give and I give a lot  
But don't you speak for me  
No don't you speak for me  
Whether you like it or not  
Don't you speak for me
