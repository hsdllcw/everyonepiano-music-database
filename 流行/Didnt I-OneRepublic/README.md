### Didn't I歌词：

Didn't I didn't I didn't I love you  
Didn't we didn't we didn't we fly  
Know that I know that I still care for you  
But didn't we didn't we say goodbye  
Swear that I saw your face  
At a coffee shop on 8th  
Or maybe it was in my mind  
And I swear that I heard your laugh  
From a person that walked past me  
At a party the other night  
Never thought we'd ever have to go without  
Take you over anybody else hands down  
We're the type of melody that don't fade out  
Don't fade out can't fade out  
Didn't I didn't I didn't I love you  
Didn't we didn't we didn't we fly  
Know that I know that I still care for you  
But didn't we didn't we say goodbye  
Didn't I didn't I didn't I love you  
Didn't we didn't we didn't we try  
Know that I know that I still care for you  
Tell me why good things have to die  
Do you remember all those plans  
That we made after too many drinks  
In the kitchen of your brother's apartment  
When life was like a wishin' well  
4:00 AM and raisin' hell  
D**n I knew you oh-so well  
Never thought we'd ever have to go without  
Take you over anybody else hands down  
We're the type of melody that don't fade out  
Don't fade out can't fade out  
Didn't I didn't I didn't I love you  
Didn't we didn't we didn't we fly  
Know that I know that I still care for you  
But didn't we didn't we say goodbye  
Didn't I didn't I didn't I love you  
Didn't we didn't we didn't we try  
Know that I know that I still care for you  
Tell me why good things have to die  
We had our moments didn't we  
Oh  
So much that we will never be  
Oh  
Didn't I didn't I didn't I love you  
Didn't we didn't we didn't we fly  
Know that I know that I still care for you  
But didn't we didn't we say goodbye  
Didn't I didn't I didn't I love you  
Didn't we didn't we didn't we try  
Didn't we try  
Know that I know that I still care for you  
For  
Tell me why good things have to die  
To die
