### Company 歌词：

Can we, we keep, keep each other company?  
Maybe we can be, be each other's company  
Oh, company

Let's set each other's lonely nights  
Be each other's paradise  
Need a picture for my frame  
Someone to share my reign  
Tell me what you wanna drink  
I tell you what I got in mind  
Oh, I don't know your name  
But I feel like that's gonna change

You ain't gotta be my lover for you to call me "baby"  
Never been around, no pressure. Ain't that serious?

Can we, we keep, keep each other company?  
Maybe we can be, be each other's company  
Oh, company

It ain't about the complications  
I'm all about the elevation  
We can keep it goin' up  
Oh, don't miss out on us  
Just wanna have a conversation  
Forget about the obligations  
Maybe we can stay in touch  
Oh, that ain't doin' too much

You ain't gotta be my lover for me to call you "baby"  
Never been around, no pressure. Ain't that serious? No.

Can we, we keep, keep each other company?  
Maybe we can be, be each other's company  
Oh, company

Can we be, can we be, be each other's company,  
Be each other's company,  
Just be each other's company,  
Be each other's company?

Can we, we keep, keep each other company?  
Maybe we can be, be each other's company  
Oh, company
