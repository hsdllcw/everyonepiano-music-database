**Slide** 是美国三人摇滚团体Goo Goo Dolls所演唱的一首歌曲，收录在其专辑Dizzy Up The Gril中。

对于自1987年便已发表其首张同名专辑的Goo Goo Dolls而言，"Dizzy Up The Gril"其实已是Goo Goo
Doll的第六张专辑，但却是他们于1996年以"A Boy Named
Goo"专辑(1995发行)首次在主流乐坛绽放光芒之后，令人期待近三年之久后于1998年9月发行的首张全新专辑。Goo Goo
Dolls在此辑中的表现，很明显地又比前作成熟进步不少，圆融地将各种不同性格--
强硬中带着温柔、侵略中又带有技巧，毫无间隙地凝聚成一首首精彩之作。因此，你可以在辑中同时听到铿锵有力的吉他节奏与悠扬的小提琴旋律共存的抒情曲「Black
Balloon」、活泼有力的流行曲「January Friend」，以及充满爆发力又不失优雅的摇滚曲「Bullet
Proof」。此辑不仅已在美国创下首批销售达50万张金唱片纪录，发行至今亦已累积销售近2百万张。此亚洲版除了收录「Iris」(#9)这首为电影所创的畅销名曲，及Billboard流行榜#8名、Adult
Top 40榜#3名单曲「 _Slide_ 」外，还额外收录其"A Boy Named Goo"专辑中的流行榜#5名、Modern
Rock榜4周冠军曲「Name」...作品。

### Slide歌词：

Could you whisper in my ear  
The things you wanna feel  
I'd give you anythin'  
To feel it comin'

Do you wake up on your own  
And wonder where you are?  
You live with all your faults

I wanna wake up where you are  
I won't say anything at all  
So why don't you slide

Yeah, I'm gonna let it slide

Don't you love the life you killed?  
The priest is on the phone  
Your father hit the wall  
Your ma disowned you

Don't supposed I'll ever know  
What it means to be a man  
It's somethin' I can't change  
I'll live around it

I wanna wake up where you are  
I won't say anything at all  
So why don't you slide  
Ooh, slide

And I'll do anythin' you ever dreamed to be complete  
Little pieces of the nothin' that fall  
Oh, May  
Put your arms around me  
What you feel is what you are  
And what you are is beautiful  
Oh, May  
Do you wanna get married Or run away?

And I'll do anythin' you ever dreamed to be complete  
Little pieces of the nothin' that fall  
Oh, May  
Put your arms around me  
What you feel is what you are  
And what you are is beautiful  
Oh, May  
Do you wanna get married  
Or run away?

I wanna wake up where you are  
I won't say anything

And I'll do anythin' you ever dreamed to be complete  
(Yeah, slide)  
Little pieces of the nothin' that fall  
(yeah slide)  
And I'll do anythin' you ever dreamed to be complete  
(Yeah slide)  
Little pieces of the nothin' that fall  
(Oh, oh slide)  
Yeah, slide between the sheets of all them beds you never knew  
(Yeah slide)  
Why don't you slide into my room  
Just slide into my room  
Oh, we'll run away, run away, run away
