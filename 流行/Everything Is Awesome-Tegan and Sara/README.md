### Everything Is Awesome歌词：

Everything is awesome  
Everything is cool when you're part of a team  
Everything is awesome, when we're living our dream

Everything is better when we stick together  
Side by side, you and I gonna win forever, let's party forever  
We're the same, I'm like you, you're like me, we're all working in harmony

Everything is awesome  
Everything is cool when you're part of a team  
Everything is awesome, when we're living our dream

(Wooo)  
3, 2, 1. Go

Have you heard the news, everyone's talking  
Life is good 'cause everything's awesome  
Lost my job, it's a new opportunity  
More free time for my awesome community

I feel more awesome than an awesome opossum  
Dip my body in chocolate frostin'  
Three years later, wash off the frostin'  
Smellin' like a blossom, everything is awesome  
Stepped in mud, got new brown shoes  
It's awesome to win, and it's awesome to lose (it's awesome to lose)

Everything is better when we stick together  
Side by side, you and I, gonna win forever, let's party forever  
We're the same, I'm like you, you're like me, we're all working in harmony

Everything is awesome  
Everything is cool when you're part of a team  
Everything is awesome, when we're living our dream

Blue skies, bouncy springs  
We just named two awesome things  
A Nobel prize, a piece of string  
You know what's awesome? EVERYTHING!

Dogs with fleas, allergies, a book of Greek antiquities  
Brand new pants, a very old vest  
Awesome items are the best

Trees, frogs, clogs  
They're awesome  
Rocks, clocks, and socks  
They're awesome  
Figs, and jigs, and twigs  
That's awesome  
Everything you see, or think, or say  
Is awesome

Everything is awesome  
Everything is cool when you're part of a team  
Everything is awesome, when we're living our dream
