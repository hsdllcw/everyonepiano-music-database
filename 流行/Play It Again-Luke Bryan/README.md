Play It Again歌词：

She was sittin all alone over on the tailgate

Tan legs swingin by a Georgia plate

I was lookin for her boyfriend

Thinkin,no way she aint got one

Soon as I sat down, I was fallin in love

Tryin to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup

Talkin over the speakers in the back of that truck

She jumped up and cut me off

She was like, oh my God, this is my song

Ive been listenin to the radio all night long

Sittin round waitin for it to come on and here it is

She was like, come here boy, I wanna dance

Fore I said a word, she was takin my hand

Spinnin me around til it faded out

And she gave me a kiss

And she said, play it again, play it again, play it again

And I said, play it again, play it again, play it again

Id have gave that DJ my last dime

If he would have played it just one more time

But a little while later

We were sittin in the drive in my truck

Before I walked her to the door

I was scannin like a fool,AM, FM, XM too

But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove

Man, you should have seen her light up

She was like, oh my God, this is my song

Weve been listenin to the radio all night long

I cant believe that it came back on, but here it is

She was like, come here boy, I wanna dance

Fore I said a word, she was takin my hand

Spinnin in the headlights, she gave me a goodnight kiss

And I said, play it again, play it again, play it again

And she said, play it again, play it again, play it again

The next Friday night,we were sittin out under the stars

You should have seen her smilewhen I broke out my guitar

She was like, oh my God, this is my song

Ive been listenin to the radio all night long

Sittin round waitin for it to come on and here it is

She was like, come here boy, I wanna dance

Fore I said a word, she was takin my hand

Spinnin in the headlights, she gave me a goodnight kiss

And she said, play it again, play it again, play it again

And I said, play it again, play it again, play it again

Yeah, play it again, play it again, play it again

Somebody, play it again, play it again, play it again
