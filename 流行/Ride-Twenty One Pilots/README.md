### Ride歌词：

I just wanna stay in the sun where I find  
I know it's hard sometimes  
Pieces of peace in the sun's piece of mind  
I know it's hard sometimes  
Yeah I think about the end just way too much  
But it's fun to fantasize  
All my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was  
But it's fun to fantasize  
Oh oh I'm falling  
So I'm taking my time on my ride  
Oh I'm falling  
So I'm taking my time on my ride  
Taking my time on my ride  
I'd die for you that's easy to say  
We have a list of people that we would take  
A bullet for them a bullet for you  
A bullet for everybody in this room  
But I don't seem to see many bullets coming through  
See many bullets coming through  
Metaphorically I'm the man  
But literally I don't know what I'd do  
I'd live for you and that's hard to do  
Even harder to say when you know it's not true  
Even harder to write when you know that tonight  
There are people back home which are talking to you  
But then you ignore them still  
All these questions they're forming like  
Who would you live for  
Who would you die for  
And would you ever kill  
Oh oh I'm falling  
So I'm taking my time on my ride  
Oh I'm falling  
So I'm taking my time on my ride  
Taking my time on my ride  
I've been thinking too much  
I've been thinking too much  
I've been thinking too much  
I've been thinking too much  
Help me  
I've been thinking too much  
I've been thinking too much  
I've been thinking too much  
Help me  
I've been thinking too much  
I've been thinking too much  
I've been thinking too much  
Oh oh I'm falling  
So I'm taking my time on my ride  
Oh I'm falling so I'm taking my time  
Taking my time on my ride  
Oh oh I'm falling  
So I'm taking my time on my ride  
Oh I'm falling  
So I'm taking my time on my  
I've been thinking too much  
Help me  
I've been thinking too much  
Help me  
I've been thinking too much  
I've been thinking too much  
I've been thinking too much  
Help me  
I've been thinking too much  
I've been thinking too much  
I've been thinking too much  
Help me
