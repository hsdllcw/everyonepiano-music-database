### No One歌词：

I just want you close  
Where you can stay forever  
You can be sure  
That it will only get better  
You and me together  
Through the days and nights  
I don’t worry ‘coz  
Everythings gonna be alright  
People keep talking  
They can say what they like  
But all I know is everything’s gonna be alright

No one no one no one  
Can get in the way of what I’m feeling  
No one no one no one  
Can get in the way of what I feel for you  
You you  
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

When the rain is pouring down  
And my heart is hurting  
You will always be around  
This I know for certain

You and me together  
Through the days and nights

I don’t worry cause  
Everythings gonna be alright  
People keep talking  
They can say what they like  
But all I know is everything’s gonna be alright

No one no one no one  
Can get in the way of what I’m feeling  
No one no one no one  
Can get in the way of what I feel for you  
You you  
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

I know some people search the world  
To find something like what we have  
I know people will try  
Try to divide  
Something so real  
So till the end of time  
I’m telling you that

No one no one no one  
Can get in the way of what I’m feeling  
No one no one no one  
Can get in the way of what I feel for you  
oh oh oh …
