### Flowers歌词：

We were good we were gold  
Kind of dream that can't be sold  
We were right 'til we weren't  
Built a home and watched it burn  
Hmm I didn't wanna leave you I didn't wanna lie  
Started to cry but then remembered I  
I can buy myself flowers  
Write my name in the sand  
Talk to myself for hours  
See things you don't understand  
I can take myself dancing  
And I can hold my own hand  
Yeah I can love me better than you can  
Can love me better I can love me better baby  
Can love me better I can love me better baby  
Paint my nails cherry red  
Match the roses that you left  
No remorse no regret  
I forget every word you said  
Ooh I didn't wanna leave you baby I didn't wanna fight  
Started to cry but then remembered I  
I can buy myself flowers  
Write my name in the sand  
Talk to myself for hours  
See things you don't understand  
I can take myself dancing yeah  
I can hold my own hand  
Yeah I can love me better than you can  
Can love me better I can love me better baby  
Can love me better I can love me better baby  
Can love me better I can love me better baby  
Can love me better I  
I didn't wanna leave you baby I didn't wanna fight  
Started to cry but then remembered I  
I can buy myself flowers  
Uh-uh  
Write my name in the sand  
Talk to myself for hours  
Yeah-eah  
See things you don't understand  
I can take myself dancing yeah  
I can hold my own hand  
Yeah I can love me better than  
Yeah I can love me better than you can  
Can love me better I can love me better baby  
Can love me better I can love me better baby  
Baby  
Can love me better I can love me better baby  
Can love me better I
