### Battle Symphony歌词：

I got a long way to go  
And a long memory  
I been searching for an answer  
Always just out of reach  
Blood on the floor  
Sirens repeat  
I been searching for the courage  
To face my enemies

When they turn down the lights

I hear my battle symphony  
All the world in front of me  
If my armor breaks  
I'll fuse it back together  
Battle symphony  
Please just don't give up on me  
And my eyes are wide awake

For my battle symphony  
For my battle symphony

They say that I don't belong  
Say that I should retreat  
That I'm marching to the rhythm  
Of a lonesome defeat  
But the sound of your voice  
Puts the pain in reverse  
No surrender, no illusions  
And for better or worse

When they turn down the lights

I hear my battle symphony  
All the world in front of me  
If my armor breaks  
I'll fuse it back together  
Battle symphony  
Please just don't give up on me  
And my eyes are wide awake

If I fall, get knocked down  
Pick myself up off the ground  
If I fall, get knocked down  
Pick myself up off the ground

When they turn down the lights

I hear my battle symphony  
All the world in front of me  
If my armor breaks  
I'll fuse it back together  
Battle symphony  
Please just don't give up on me  
And my eyes are wide awake

For my battle symphony  
For my battle symphony
