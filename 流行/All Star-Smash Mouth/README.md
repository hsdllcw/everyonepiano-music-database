**All Star双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_All Star_ 是破嘴合唱团，即Smash
Mouth演唱的歌曲。乐队1994年成军于加州圣荷西，是支发扬庞克乐精神并发誓创造出最快乐的摇滚乐的队伍。团名的灵感来自于美式足球联盟NFL传奇巨星Mike
Ditka形容一种强调夺球本能的运动——Smash Mouth Football。主唱Steve Harwell，鼓手Kevin
Coleman，贝斯手Paul De Lisle，吉他手Greg
Camp。Steve与Kevin源自街头庞克族的活力，撞上Greg、Paul这对音乐玩家，一种精炖烘培伽州摇滚佳肴于焉出炉，散发着hip-
hop、拉丁、雷鬼、庞克、冲浪摇滚、ska、流行等不同佐料的风味，最重要的是，Smash Mouth找回了玩摇滚与听摇滚最基本的乐趣。

### All Star歌词：

Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me  
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed  
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb  
In the shape of an l on her forehead  
Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming  
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running  
Didn't make sense not to live for fun  
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb  
So much to do so much to see  
So what's wrong with taking the back streets  
You'll never know if you don't go  
Smashmouth  
You'll never shine if you don't glow  
Hey now you're an all star get your game on go play  
Hey now you're a rock star get the show on get paid  
And all that glitters is gold  
Only shooting stars break the mold  
It's a cool place and they say it gets colder  
You're bundled up now but wait 'til you get older  
But the meteor men beg to differ  
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture  
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin  
The waters getting warm so you might as well swim  
My world's on fire how about yours  
Chorus  
Hey now you're an all star get your game on go play  
Hey now you're a rock star get the show on get paid  
And all that glitters is gold  
Only shooting stars break the mold  
Somebody once asked could you spare some change for gas  
I need to get myself away from this place  
I said yep what a concept  
I could use a little fuel myself  
And we could all use a little change  
Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming  
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running  
Didn't make sense not to live for fun  
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb  
So much to do so much to see  
So what's wrong with taking the back streets  
You'll never know if you don't go  
You'll never shine if you don't glow  
Chorus  
Hey now you're an all star get your game on go play  
Hey now you're a rock star get the show on get paid  
And all that glitters is gold  
Only shooting stars break the mold
