**Little Me** 是英国少女团体Little Mix的歌曲。Little Mix（小混合、小混混）由Perrie Edwards, Jesy
Nelson, Leigh-Anne Pinnock及Jade Thirlwall所组成。

  
她们因打破传统成为英国人气歌唱比赛The X
Factor史上第一个夺冠的团体而成名，除此之外，她们的夺冠经历更改写了女子团体在比赛中一定走不远的命运。Little Mix不仅改写了The X
Factor的历史，赛后也有傲人的成绩，她们是自2005年以来第一个不用在The X Factor上表演就能够首单空降英国单曲榜的冠军。

  
Little Mix的另一卖点是她们完美的和声，在现今众多女子组合都不再流行和声的年代，这四个女孩在The X
Factor上一次又一次的精彩演出为她们带来了大量的支持者，她们在第7周演绎的歌曲"Don't Let
Go"更是因为她们的表演而在多年后重新于英国单曲榜中出现。

### Little Me歌词：

[Jade:]  
She lives in the shadow of a lonely girl  
Voice so quiet you don't hear a word,  
Always talking but she can't be heard,

[Leigh- Anne:]  
You can see there if you catch her eye,  
I know she's brave but it's trapped inside,  
Scared to talk but she don't know why,

Wish I knew back then  
What I know now.  
Wish I could somehow  
Go back in time and maybe listen to my own advice.

I'd tell her to speak up, tell her to shout out,  
Talk a bit louder, be a bit prouder,  
Tell her she's beautiful, wonderful,  
Everything she doesn't see,

You gotta speak up, you gotta shout out,  
And know that right here, right now,  
You can be beautiful, wonderful,  
Anything you wanna be,

[Jesy:]  
Little me

Yeah, you got a lot of time to act your age,  
You can't write a book from a single page,  
Hands on the clock only turn one way,

(Yeah)

[Perrie:]  
Run too fast and you'll risk it all,  
Can't be afraid to take a fall,  
Felt so big but she looks so small,

Wish I knew back then  
What I know now.  
Wish I could somehow  
Go back in time and maybe listen to my own advice.

I'd tell her to speak up, tell her to shout out,  
Talk a bit louder, be a bit prouder,  
Tell her she's beautiful, wonderful,  
Everything she doesn't see.  
(Know that right here, right now)

You gotta speak up, you gotta shout out,  
And know that right here, right now,  
You can be beautiful, wonderful,  
Anything you wanna be, oh,  
Little me

Little me, yeah

[Leigh-Anne:]  
Tell you one thing I would say to her

[All:]  
I'd tell her to speak up, tell her to shout out,  
Talk a bit louder, be a bit prouder,  
Tell her she's beautiful, wonderful,  
Everything she doesn't see.

(You got to) you gotta speak up, (You got to) you gotta shout out,  
And know that right here, right now,  
You can be beautiful, wonderful,  
Anything you wanna be,  
Little me

I'd tell her to speak up, tell her to shout out,  
Talk a bit louder, be a bit prouder,  
Tell her she's beautiful, wonderful,  
Everything she doesn't see.

You gotta speak up, you gotta shout out,  
And know that right here, right now,  
You can be beautiful, wonderful,  
Anything you wanna be,

I'd tell her to speak up, tell her to shout out,  
Talk a bit louder, be a bit prouder,  
Tell her she's beautiful, wonderful,  
Everything she doesn't see.

You gotta speak up, you gotta shout out,  
And know that right here, right now,  
You can be beautiful, wonderful,  
Anything you wanna be,  
Little me
