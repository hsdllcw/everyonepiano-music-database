### Heartbeats歌词：

One night to be confused  
One night to speed up truth  
We had a promise made  
four hands and then away  
Both under influence  
we had demons in  
To know what to say  
Mind is a razorblade  
To call for hands of above  
to lean on  
Wouldn't be good enough  
for me, no  
One night of magic truth  
The start of simple truth  
One night to push and scream  
and then relief  
Ten days of perfect tunes  
The colors red and blue  
We had a promise made  
we were in love  
To call for hands of above  
to lean on  
Wouldn't be good enough  
for me, no  
To call for hands of above  
to lean on  
Wouldn't be good enough  
for me, no  
And you  
you knew the hand of a devil  
And you  
kept us away with wolf teeths  
sharing different heartbeats  
in one night  
To call for hands of above  
to lean on  
Wouldn't be good enough  
for me, no  
To call for hands of above  
to lean on  
Wouldn't be good enough
