### Look Back at It歌词：

Look back at it  
She ain't never do this before but she good at it  
Said she never made love  
But she good at it  
She make a n***a feel good  
When I look at it  
I get goosebumps when I look at it  
Oh girls just wanna have fun with it  
Oh the girls just wanna have fun with me  
These girls ain't really no good for me  
Yeah hulla drat da da da  
Drdat da da da da  
Ddrat da da um da  
Ddrat da da da um da  
Yeah got a new Benz that I ain't promotin'  
All of my friends love money throw it  
Ddrat da da da um da  
Let me tell you something 'bout my life  
And every single chain and my diamond rings  
The way you walkin' the way you talkin'  
It's all because of me  
And the way I'm all on you girl you know it's true  
The way I speak is a melody  
Don't you ever think it's another me  
Girl on everything it's a lot on me  
I cannot be seen I cannot be takin' apologies  
Yeah they proud of me 'cause that bag on me  
Yeah they after me I got racks on me  
Got the stash on me think they gassin' me  
Yeah hoodie on low but I stay focused  
Yeah it's hard to stay low when everybody notice yeah  
Look back at it  
She ain't never do this before but she good at it  
Said she never made love but she good at it  
She make a n***a feel good when I look at it  
I get goosebumps when I look at it  
Oh girls just wanna have fun with it  
Oh the girls just wanna have fun with me  
These girls ain't really no good for me yeah

Hit a lick and split it with my guys guys  
Gettin' rich I'm really lit but I I  
Ain't s**t I admit it but I try try  
If I'm wrong just tell me that I'm right
