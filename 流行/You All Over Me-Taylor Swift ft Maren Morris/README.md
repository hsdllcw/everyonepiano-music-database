**You All Over Me** 是美国女歌手Taylor Swift与Maren
Morris一同合作演唱的歌曲，后被收录在Taylor第二录音室专辑《Fearless》的重制版唱片中。

这是一首轻缓的吉他旋律和微弱的架子鼓节拍相结合的苦情音乐。整首歌曲以吉他的轻弹贯穿始终，搭配架子鼓的适时敲击逐渐展开，中速的节奏既不像慢速般拖泥带水，也不像快速般慌乱急促，营造出一种温馨舒适的氛围。歌词在讲述一位少女分手后，无法将恋人忘怀的苦痛故事，Taylor悲恸欲绝的细腻哭诉配合Maren饱满温润的背景和声，更是将“无法将你释怀”抒发到了极致。

### You All Over Me歌词：

Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement  
Shouldn't I find a stain but I never do  
The way the tires turn stones on old county roads  
They leave 'em muddy underneath reminds me of you  
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls  
You know you can scratch it right off it's how we used to be  
But like the dollar in your pocket that's been spent and traded in  
You can't change where it's been reminds me of me  
I lived and I learned had you got burned  
Held out and held on  
God knows too long and wasted time  
Lost tears swore that I'd get out of here  
But no amount of freedom gets you clean  
I've still got you all over me  
The best and the worst day of June  
Was the one that I met you  
With your hands in your pockets  
And your "don't you wish you had me" grin  
But I did so I smiled and I melted like a child  
Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then  
And I lived and I learned had you got burned  
Held out and held on  
God knows too long and wasted time  
Lost tears swore that I'd get out of here  
But no amount of freedom gets you clean  
I've still got you all over me  
I lived and I learned and found out what it was to turn around  
And see that we were never really meant to be  
So I lied and I cried and I watched a part of myself die  
'Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean  
I've still got you all over me  
I've still got you all over me  
I've still got you all over me
