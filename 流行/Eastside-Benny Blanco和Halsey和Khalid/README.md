### Eastside歌词：

Khalid：  
Uh  
Yeah yeah  
When I was young I fell in love  
We used to hold hands man that was enough yeah  
Then we grew up started to touch  
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus yeah  
Oh no your daddy didn't like me much  
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one  
Oh every day she found a way out of the window to sneak out late  
She used to meet me on the Eastside  
In the city where the sun don't set  
And every day you know that we ride  
Through the backstreets of a blue Corvette  
Baby you know I just wanna leave tonight  
We can go anywhere we want  
Drive down to the coast jump in the sea  
Just take my hand and come with me  
We can do anything if we put our minds to it  
Take your whole life then you put a line through it  
My love is yours if you're willing to take it  
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it  
So come away starting today  
Start a new life together in a different place  
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be  
So baby run away with me  
Halsey：  
Seventeen and we got a dream to have a family  
A house and everything in between  
And then oh suddenly we turned twenty-three  
Now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously  
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay  
Half our friends are now are enemies  
Now I I'm thinking back to when I was young  
Back to the day when I was falling in love  
He used to meet me on the Eastside  
In the city where the sun don't set  
And every day you know where we ride  
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette  
And baby you know I just wanna leave tonight  
We can go anywhere we want  
Drive down to the coast jump in the sea  
Just take my hand and come with me  
Singing  
Halsey/Khalid：  
We can do anything if we put our minds to it  
Take your whole life then you put a line through it  
My love is yours if you're willing to take it  
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it  
So come away starting today  
Start a new life together in a different place  
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be  
So baby run away with me  
Run away now  
Run away now  
Run away now  
Run away now  
Run away now  
Run away now  
Halsey：  
He used to meet me on the Eastside  
Khalid：  
She used to meet me on the Eastside  
Halsey：  
He used to meet me on the Eastside  
Khalid：  
She used to meet me on the Eastside  
In the city where the sun don't set
