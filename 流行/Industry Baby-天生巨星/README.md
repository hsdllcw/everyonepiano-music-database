Lil Nas X/Jack Harlow：  
I told you long ago on the road  
I got what they waiting for  
I don't run from nothing dog  
Get your soldiers tell 'em I ain't layin' low  
B***h I ain't runnin' from nowhere  
You was never really rooting for me anyway  
When I'm back up at the top I wanna hear you say  
He don't run from nothin' dog  
Get your soldiers tell 'em that the break is over  
Jack Harlow：  
My track record so clean they couldn't wait to just bash me  
I must be gettin' too flashy y'all shouldn't have let the world gas me  
Woo  
It's too late 'cause I'm here to stay and these girls know that I'm nasty  
Mm  
I sent her back to her boyfriend with my handprint on her a*s cheek  
City talkin' we takin' notes  
Tell 'em all to keep makin' posts wish he could but he can't get close  
OG so proud of me that he chokin' up while he makin' toasts  
I'm the type that you can't control said I would then I made it so  
I don't clear up rumors  
Ayy  
Where's y'all sense of humor  
Ayy  
I'm done makin' jokes 'cause they got old like baby boomers  
Turned my haters to consumers I make vets feel like they juniors  
Juniors  
Say your time is comin' soon but just like Oklahoma  
Mmm  
Mine is comin' sooner  
Mmm  
I'm just a late bloomer  
Mmm  
I didn't peak in high school I'm still out here gettin' cuter  
Woo  
All these social networks and computers  
Got these p***ies walkin' 'round like they ain't losers  
Lil Nas X：  
I told you long ago on the road  
I got what they waiting for  
I don't run from nothing dog  
Get your soldiers tell 'em I ain't layin' low  
B***h I ain't runnin' from nowhere  
You was never really rooting for me anyway  
When I'm back up at the top I wanna hear you say  
He don't run from nothin' dog  
Get your soldiers tell 'em that the break is over  
I'm the industry baby  
I'm the industry baby  
Yeah
