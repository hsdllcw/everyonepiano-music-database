**I Miss You双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_I Miss You_ 由英国电音乐队Clean Bandit制作、美国女歌手Julia Michaels演唱的一首歌曲，于2017年10月27日发布。

古典乐与电子乐融合的概念其实并不新奇，然而Clean Bandit的独到之处便在于，古典弦乐在他们的音乐中扮演的不再是一个辅助的角色。Clean
Bandit始终以一种DIY的态度做音乐，除了是古典与电子的混搭，他们还利用一切可以利用的资源，将其融入进他们的音乐中。在这支乐队中，没有真正意义上的主唱，他们找来不同的歌手在不同的歌曲中进行合唱，寻找一种最完美的平衡。

### I Miss You歌词：

I know you're out in Cabo  
Hanging with your brother  
Wishin' that I was your bottle  
So I could be close to your lips again  
I know you didn't call your parents  
And tell 'em that we ended  
'Cause you know that they'd be offended  
Did you not want to tell 'em it's the end  
And I know we're not supposed to talk  
But I'm getting ahead of myself  
I get scared when we're not  
'Cause I'm scared you're with somebody else  
So I guess that it's gone  
And I just keep lying to myself  
Oh I can't believe it I  
I miss you yeah I miss you  
I miss you yeah I miss you oh I do  
I miss you yeah I miss you  
Though I'm tryin' not to right now  
You weren't a fan of pictures  
So I hardly ever took 'em  
Got them saved in my mind from the bedroom  
So that way I can't forget your skin  
So I saved all the texts  
All of the best over the years  
Just to remind myself  
Of how good it is  
Or was  
And I know we're not supposed to talk  
But I'm getting ahead of myself  
I get scared when we're not  
'Cause I'm scared you're with somebody else  
So I guess that it's gone  
And I just keep lying to myself  
Oh I can't believe it I  
I miss you yeah I miss you  
I miss you yeah I miss you oh I do  
I miss you yeah I miss you  
Though I'm tryin' not to right now  
So I saved all the texts  
All of the best over the years  
Just to remind myself  
Of how good it is  
Yeah I saved all the texts off of my ex  
Minus the tears  
Just to remind myself  
Of how good it is  
Or was 'cause I  
I miss you yeah I miss you  
I miss you yeah I miss you oh I do  
I miss you yeah I miss you  
Though I'm tryin' not to right now  
I can't help it I just  
Though I'm tryin' not to right now  
I can't help it I just
