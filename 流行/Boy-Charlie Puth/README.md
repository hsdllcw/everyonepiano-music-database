**Boy双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Boy_ 是由美国流行男歌手Charlie Puth录唱的一首歌曲，被收录在Charlie
Puth的第二张录音室专辑Voicenotes。此曲好听到爆，这前奏一秒进入让人沉醉的浓浓的欧美风格。

Charlie Puth因翻唱多首经典歌曲在YouTube上获得关注与赞誉，虽然以这样“接地气”的方式成名，但其实除天赋以外，Charlie
Puth一直接受正统的音乐训练与熏陶，伯克利音乐学院科班出身的他功底深厚，自幼研习多种乐器，练得一手专业的钢琴技法，嗓音干净悠扬，高音透彻，低音沉稳，再加上出众的创作才能，即便在更新迭代迅猛而无情的欧美乐坛，这样的音乐才子也实为不可多得。

### Boy歌词：

I got these girls tryna lock me down  
And I always up and leave  
But for the first time in a while  
I wanna throw away the key  
And I know you've been in  
A couple more relationships than me  
'Cause you talk a different talk  
And you kiss me differently  
Now I don't know where to go  
After you left me this way  
After you love me so good  
How are you gonna tell me you don't wanna stay  
You're tellin' me I'm too young but  
I can't feel what you want to  
Baby how do you treat me just like  
Like a boy  
You won't wake up beside me  
'Cause I was born in the '90s  
Baby how do you treat me just like  
Like a boy don't treat me like  
Boy don't treat me like  
Boy  
You told me you needed a perfect guy  
That'll make your parents proud  
Guess you still ain't found him yet why  
'Cause we're still messin' around  
And now you watch me put in all this work  
Just to say it won't work out  
You never took me seriously  
Now what the hell is that about  
Now I don't know where to go  
After you left me this way  
After you love me so good  
How are you gonna tell me you don't wanna stay  
You're tellin' me I'm too young but  
I can't feel what you want to  
Baby how do you treat me just like  
Like a boy  
You won't wake up beside me  
'Cause I was born in the '90s  
Baby how do you treat me just like  
Like a boy don't treat me like  
Boy don't treat me like  
Boy  
Baby don't you treat me like a boy  
Boy don't treat me like  
Boy don't treat me like  
Boy  
You're tellin' me I'm too young but  
I can't feel what you want to  
Baby how do you treat me just like  
Like a boy  
You won't wake up beside me  
'Cause I was born in the '90s  
Baby how do you treat me just like  
Like a boy don't treat me like  
Boy don't treat me like  
Boy  
Baby don't you treat me like a boy  
Boy don't treat me like  
Boy don't treat me like  
Boy  
Just like like a boy  
Just like like a boy
