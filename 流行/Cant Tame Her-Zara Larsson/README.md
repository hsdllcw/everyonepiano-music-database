### Can't Tame Her歌词：

Can't change her can't blame her can't tame her  
Don't need no one she can dance on her own  
Club is closed soon but she ain't going home  
Night is still young where the hell will she go  
Nobody knows nobody knows  
Ain't the first time 'cause I've seen her before  
Smell her perfume as she walks through the door  
I wanna know where the hell will she go  
Nobody knows nobody nobody knows  
No you can't tame the girl 'cause she runs her own world  
So if she wanna party all night  
All night  
No you can't tame her no  
And you can't tie her down when the night comes around  
Say she gonna party all night  
All night  
And you can't change her can't blame her can't tame her  
Can't tame her magic energy she's so magnetic  
Pulls you in every time  
Every time  
Every time  
Every time  
But she don't care she gonna do what she wants  
She wants  
Because she never needed any reason  
Reason  
Yeah she a girl and she just wanna have fun ooh ooh ooh  
No you can't tame the girl  
You can't tame her no  
'Cause she runs her own world  
So if she wanna party all night  
All night  
No you can't tame her no  
And you can't tie her down when the night comes around  
Say she gonna party all night  
All night  
And you can't change her can't blame her can't tame her  
No no  
And you can't change her can't blame her can't tame her  
Don't need no one she can dance on her own  
Club is closed soon but she ain't going home  
Night is still young where the hell will she go  
Nobody nobody nobody knows  
Ain't the first time 'cause I've seen her before  
Smell her perfume as she walks through the door  
I wanna know where the hell will she go  
Nobody knows nobody nobody knows  
No  
No you can't tame the girl 'cause she runs her own world  
Runs her own world  
So if she wanna party all night  
If she wanna party all night  
All night  
No you can't tame her no  
And you can't tie her down when the night comes around  
Say she gonna party all night  
All night  
And you can't change her  
Yeah you can't  
Can't blame her  
Yeah you can't  
Can't tame her  
You can't tame her you can't tame her  
And you can't change her can't blame her can't tame her
