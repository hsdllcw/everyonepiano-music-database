**Call Out My Name双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Call Out My Name_ 是加拿大创作型歌手The Weeknd的歌曲。收录在其EP My Dear
Melancholy中。该专辑以十六万九千张的美国首周销量取得公告牌专辑榜冠军。

The Weeknd的音乐与众不同，他的音乐作品大多节奏舒缓，却又是激情暗涌的，能紧紧抓住听众的心。他通过运用沉闷的低音和大量的Lo-
Fi回声营造出黑暗氛围，再加上他与迈克尔•杰克逊相似的唱腔让听众对他的音乐欲罢不能。在黑人音乐的丝滑性感之余，加入神秘的中东及阿拉伯音乐元素，再加上他本人的朋克及摇滚音乐影响，各种暗香浮动，令他的R&B充满革新的前卫味道，在主流黑人音乐中显得清新悦耳。

### Call Out My Name歌词：

We found each other  
I helped you out of a broken place  
You gave me comfort  
But falling for you was my mistake  
I put you on top I put you on top  
I claimed you so proud and openly  
And when times were rough when times were rough  
I made sure I held you close to me  
So call out my name  
Call out my name  
Call out my name when I kiss you  
So gently I want you to stay  
Want you to stay  
I want you to stay even though you don't want me  
Girl why can't you wait  
Why can't you wait baby  
Girl why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love  
Won't you call out my name  
Call out my name  
Girl call out my name and I'll be on my way  
I'll be on my  
I said I didn't feel nothing baby but I lied  
I almost cut a piece of myself for your life  
Guess I was just another pitstop  
'Til you made up your mind  
You just wasted my time  
You're on top  
I put you on top  
I claimed you so proud and openly babe  
And when times were rough when times were rough  
I made sure I held you close to me  
So call out my name  
Call out my name baby  
So call out my name when I kiss you  
So gently I want you to stay  
I want you to stay  
I want you to stay even though you don't want me  
Girl why can't you wait  
Girl why can't you wait 'til I  
Girl why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love baby  
Baby call out my name  
Say call out my name baby  
Girl call out my name and I'll be on my way  
Girl I'll be on my  
On my way  
On my way  
On my way  
On my way  
On my way  
On my way  
On my way  
On my way  
On my way  
On my way  
On my way  
On on
