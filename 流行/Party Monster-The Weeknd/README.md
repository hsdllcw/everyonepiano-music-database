**Party Monster双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Party Monster_ 是加拿大创作型歌手The
Weeknd的歌曲。他的音乐作品大多节奏舒缓，却又是激情暗涌的，能紧紧抓住听众的心。他通过运用沉闷的低音和大量的Lo-
Fi回声营造出黑暗氛围，再加上他与迈克尔•杰克逊相似的唱腔让听众对他的音乐欲罢不能。在黑人音乐的丝滑性感之余，加入神秘的中东及阿拉伯音乐元素，再加上他本人的朋克及摇滚音乐影响，各种暗香浮动，令他的R&B充满革新的前卫味道，在主流黑人音乐中显得清新悦耳。

Party Monster官方MV正式公开。完全标志性的The Weeknd风格，犹如暗夜里诱人的毒花，每个音符都有着蛊惑人心的魔力~~更有打雷姐Lana
Del Rey惊喜出现。

### Party Monster歌词：

[The Weeknd:]  
I'm good, I'm good, I'm great  
Know it's been a while, now I'm mixing up the drink  
I just need a girl who gon' really understand  
I just need a girl who gon' really understand  
I'm good, I'm good, I'm great  
Know it's been a while, now I'm mixing up the drink  
I just need a girl who gon' really understand  
I just need a girl who gon' really understand  
And I seen her get richer on the pole  
I've seen her, I knew she had to know  
I've seen her take down that tequila  
Down by the liter, I knew I had to meet her  
Ooh, she mine, ooh, girl, bump and grind  
Ooh, she mine, ooh, girl, bump a line  
Angelina, lips like Angelina  
Like Selena, ass shaped like Selena  
I'm like, got up, thank the Lord for the day  
Woke up by a girl. I don't even know her name  
Woke up by a girl. I don't even know her name  
Woke up by a girl. I don't even know her name  
Got up, thank the Lord for the day  
Woke up by a girl. I don't even know her name  
Woke up by a girl. I don't even know her name  
Woke up by a girl. I don't even know her name  
I'm good, I'm good, I'm great  
Know it's been a while, now I'm mixing up the drink  
I just need a girl who gon' really understand  
I just need a girl who gon' really understand  
I'm good, I'm good, I'm great  
Know it's been a while, now I'm mixing up the drink  
I just need a girl who gon' really understand  
I just need a girl who gon' really understand  
I've been poppin', just took three in a row  
I'm down to do it again, I'm on a roll  
I've seen him outside tryna reach her  
You tryna leave him, you said I'm the reason  
Tell me lies, ooh, girl, tell me lies  
Say you're mine, I'm yours for the night  
I'm the realest, she said I'm the realest  
Head be genius, dick game be the meanest  
I'm like, got up, thank the Lord for the day  
Woke up by a girl. I don't even know her name  
Woke up by a girl. I don't even know her name  
Woke up by a girl. I don't even know her name  
Got up, thank the Lord for the day  
Woke up by a girl. I don't even know her name  
Woke up by a girl. I don't even know her name  
Woke up by a girl. I don't even know her name  
Got up, thank the Lord for the day  
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name  
Bitches in my new spot, crowdin' up my space  
Had to check the safe, check the dresser for my chains  
Got up, thank the Lord for the day  
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name  
Bitches in my new spot, crowdin' up my space  
Had to check the safe, check the dresser for my chains  
[The Weeknd & Lana Del Rey:]  
Paranoid (paranoid)  
Paranoid (oh, paranoid)  
Paranoid (paranoid)  
But I see something in you (you're paranoid)  
Paranoid (paranoid)  
Paranoid (oh, paranoid)  
Paranoid (paranoid)  
But I see something in you  
[The Weeknd:]  
Got up, thank the Lord for the day  
Woke up by a girl. I don't even know her name  
Woke up by a girl. I don't even know her name  
Woke up, woke up by a girl. I don't even know her name  
Got up, thank the Lord for the day  
Woke up by a girl. I don't even know her name  
Woke up by a girl. I don't even know her name  
Woke up, woke up by a girl. I don't even know her name  
[Lana Del Rey:]  
You're paranoid
