### Freak歌词：

Flames so hot that they turn blue  
Palms reflecting in your eyes, like an endless summer  
That's the way I feel for you  
If time stood still, I'd take this moment  
Make it last forever

Your halo's full of fire  
I'm rising up, rising up  
My hot love's full of fire  
Love's full of fire  
Ahhh

Baby, if you wanna leave  
Come to California  
Be a freak like me, too  
Screw your anonymity  
Loving me is all you need to feel  
Like I do  
We could slow dance to rock music  
Kiss while we do it  
Talk 'til we both turn blue  
Baby, if you wanna leave  
Come to California  
Be a freak like me, too

Leather black and eyes of blue (blue, blue, blue)  
Sun reflecting in your eyes, like an easy rider  
Life makes sense when I'm with you  
Looking back, my past  
It all seems stranger than a stranger

So let's dance in slow motion  
Tear it up, tear it up  
Let's dance by the ocean  
Ahhh

Baby, if you wanna leave  
Come to California  
Be a freak like me, too  
Screw your anonymity  
Loving me is all you need to feel  
Like I do  
We could slow dance to rock music  
Kiss while we do it  
Talk 'til we both turn blue  
Baby, if you wanna leave  
Come to California  
Be a freak like me, too

Oooh, you're cold as ice, baby  
But when you're nice, baby  
You're so amazing in every way  
Oooh, you're cold as ice, baby  
I don't wanna fight, baby  
It's like I told you  
If you stay, I'll stay

Baby, if you wanna leave  
Come to California  
Be a freak like me, too  
(Take it to the back if you really wanna talk)  
Screw your anonymity  
Loving me is all you need to feel  
Like I do  
We could slow dance to rock music  
Kiss while we do it  
Talk 'til we both turn blue  
Baby, if you wanna leave  
Come to California  
Be a freak like me, too
