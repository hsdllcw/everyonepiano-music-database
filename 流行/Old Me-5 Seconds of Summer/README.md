### Old Me歌词：

Shout out to the old me and everything he showed me  
Glad you didn't listen when the world was tryna slow me  
No one could control me left my lovers lonely  
Had to f**k it up before I really got to know me  
Never a night alone  
Anywhere you wanna go  
Woke up in the mornin' wearin' someone else's clothes  
Pictures in my phone  
With people I don't know  
Woke up in the mornin' how the hell did I make it home  
And I wonder how long I can keep it up  
But I wonder if I'd ever if I'd ever get enough  
And I did some s**t I never should have done  
Ayy ayy  
I would do it over now I'd do it over  
Shout out to the old me and everything he showed me  
Glad you didn't listen when the world was tryna slow me  
No one could control me left my lovers lonely  
Had to f**k it up before I really got to know me  
Ayy ayy  
All the mistakes I made I made I made I made  
Would have been the price I paid I paid I paid I paid  
Shout out to the old me and everything he showed me  
Had to f**k it up before I really got to know me  
Another round here we go  
Going in blow for blow  
Look into the mirror takin' punches that I throw  
I'm constantly reminded  
Of all the compromises  
All the people from the past who have a hard time letting go yeah  
And I wonder how long I can keep it up  
But I wonder if I'd ever if I'd ever get enough  
And I did some s**t I never should have done  
Ayy ayy  
I would do it over now I'd do it over  
Shout out to the old me and everything he showed me  
Glad you didn't listen when the world was tryna slow me  
No one could control me left my lovers lonely  
Had to f**k it up before I really got to know me  
Ayy ayy  
All the mistakes I made I made I made I made  
Would have been the price I paid I paid I paid I paid  
Shout out to the old me and everything he showed me  
Had to f**k it up before I really got to know me  
Ayy ayy  
Devil at my door  
Got me knockin' knockin' knockin' on the other side  
Ashes on the floor  
But I'm walkin' walkin' walkin' out of here alive  
Shout out to the old me and everything he showed me  
Glad you didn't listen when the world was tryna slow me  
The world was tryna slow me yeah  
No one could control me left my lovers lonely  
Lonely  
Had to f**k it up before I really got to know me  
Ayy ayy  
All the mistakes I made I made I made I made  
Would have been the price I paid I paid I paid I paid  
Paid  
Shout out to the old me and everything he showed me  
Had to f**k it up before I really got to know me  
Ayy ayy
