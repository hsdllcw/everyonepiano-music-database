_Lover_ 是由美国流行女歌手Taylor
Swift录唱的一首歌曲，收录在其第七张录音室专辑《Lover》中。专辑的基调设定为“浪漫”，她认为“Lover”不仅指爱情，还是一种生活态度，它不一定发生在快乐的时候，在孤独、悲伤、经历冲突或处理生活中的事情中，同样可以寻找浪漫，因此最终将专辑取名为《Lover》。

### Lover歌词：

We can leave the Christmas lights up 'til January  
This is our place we make the rules  
And there's a dazzling haze  
A mysterious way about you dear  
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years  
Can I go where you go  
Can we always be this close  
Forever and ever  
And ah take me out  
And take me home  
You're my my my my  
Lover  
We could let our friends crash in the living room  
This is our place  
We make the call  
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you  
I've loved you 3 summers now honey  
But I want them all  
Can I go where you go  
Can we always be this close  
Forever and ever  
And ah take me out  
And take me home  
Forever and ever  
You're my my my my  
Lover  
Ladies and gentlemen will you please stand  
With every guitar string scar on my hand  
I take this magnetic force of a man  
To be my lover  
My heart's been borrowed  
And yours has been blue  
All's well that ends well to end up with you  
Swear to be over dramatic and true to my lover  
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me  
And at every table I'll save you a seat  
Lover  
Can I go where you go  
Can we always be this close  
Forever and ever  
And ah take me out  
And take me home  
Forever and ever  
You're my my my my  
Oh you're my my my my  
Darling you're my my my my  
Lover
