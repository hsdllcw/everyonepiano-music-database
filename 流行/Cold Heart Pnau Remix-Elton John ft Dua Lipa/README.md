**Cold Heart (Pnau Remix)** 是Elton John与Dua
Lipa一同合作的单曲。寒冷的心需要独一无二、原汁原味的英伦摇滚来解冻；36.5度的蒸馏水融化浸润盛夏的枯燥无味的生活。

前奏一出来，瞬间让人梦回九十年代Elton John倾情演唱的Sacrifice。与Sacrifice的温暖治愈的风格不同，Cold
Heart里的合成器效果与Dua Lipa飘飘欲仙的嗓音相得益彰，让人不禁站起来翩翩起舞！

### Cold Heart (Pnau Remix)歌词：

Elton John：  
It's a human sign  
When things go wrong  
When the scent of her lingers  
And temptation's strong  
Cold cold heart  
Hardened by you  
Some things lookin' better baby  
Just passin' through  
Oh no no no no  
Dua Lipa：  
And I think it's gonna be a long long time  
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find  
I'm not the man they think I am at home  
Oh no no no  
And this is what I should have ever said  
When I'm fallin' but I can't dance  
Elton John：  
Cold cold heart  
Hardened by you  
Some things lookin' better baby  
Just passin' through  
Oh no no no no  
Dua Lipa：  
And I think it's gonna be a long long time  
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find  
I'm not the man they think I am at home  
Oh no no no  
No no no no  
And this is what I should have ever said  
When I'm fallin' but I can't dance  
Elton John：  
Cold cold heart  
Oh  
Hardened by you  
Some things looking better baby  
Oh  
Just passin' through  
Oh no no no no  
Dua Lipa：  
And I think it's gonna be a long long time  
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find  
I'm not the man they think I am at home  
Oh no no no  
No no no no  
And this is what I should have ever said  
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find  
When I'm fallin' but I can't dance  
Oh no no no  
Oh no no no no  
Sugar  
Oh  
Sugar  
Sugar  
Oh  
Sugar  
Oh no no no no
