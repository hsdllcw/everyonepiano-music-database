### Night Changes歌词：

Going out tonight  
Changes into something red  
Her mother doesn't  
Like that kind of dress  
Everything she never had  
She's showing off  
Driving too fast  
Moon is breaking through her hair  
She said it was something  
That she won't forget  
Having no regrets  
Is all that she really wants  
We're only getting older baby  
And I've been thinking about it lately  
Does it ever drive you crazy  
Just how fast the night changes  
Everything  
That you've ever dreamed of  
Disappearing when you wake up  
But there's nothing to be afraid of  
Even when the night changes  
It will never change me and you  
Chasing it tonight  
Doubts are running 'round her head  
He's waiting hides behind a cigarette  
Heart is beating loud  
She doesn't want it to stop  
Moving too fast  
Moon is lighting up her skin  
She's falling doesn't even know it yet  
Having no regrets is all  
That she really wants  
We're only getting older baby  
And I've been thinking about it lately  
Does it ever drive you crazy  
Just how fast the night changes  
Everything that you've ever dreamed of  
Disappearing when you wake up  
But there's nothing to be afraid of  
Even when the night changes  
It will never change me and you  
Going out tonight  
Changes into something red  
Her mother doesn't  
Like that kind of dress  
Reminds her of a missing piece  
Of innocence she lost  
We're only getting older baby  
And I've been thinking about it lately  
Does it ever drive you crazy  
Just how fast the night changes  
Everything that you've ever dreamed of  
Disappearing when you wake up  
But there's nothing to be afraid of  
Even when the night changes  
It will never change baby  
It will never change baby  
It will never change me and you
