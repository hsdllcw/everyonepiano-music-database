### Fresh Eyes歌词：

I got these fresh eyes, never seen you before like this  
My God, you're beautiful  
It's like the first time when we open the door  
Before we got used to usual

It might seem superficial, stereotypical, man  
You dress up just a little and I'm like, "Ohhh, damn"

So suddenly I'm in love with a stranger  
I can't believe she's mine  
Now all I see is you with fresh eyes, fresh eyes  
So suddenly I'm in love with a stranger  
I can't believe she's mine, yeah  
And now all I see is you with fresh eyes, fresh eyes

Appreciation, well, it comes and it goes  
But I, I'll ride that wave with you  
It's human nature to miss what's under your nose  
'Til you, 'til you remind a fool

Maybe all of this is simple  
My heart's unconditional, yeah  
You dress up just a little and I'm like, "Ohhh, damn"

So suddenly I'm in love with a stranger  
I can't believe she's mine  
Now all I see is you with fresh eyes, fresh eyes  
So suddenly I'm in love with a stranger  
I can't believe she's mine, yeah  
And now all I see is you with fresh eyes, fresh eyes

If I could bottle this up, bottle, bottle this up, I would  
I would bottle this up, bottle, bottle this up, I would  
Cause you're gorgeous in this moment  
If I could bottle this up, I would

So suddenly I'm in love with a stranger  
I can't believe she's mine  
Now all I see is you with fresh eyes, fresh eyes  
So suddenly I'm in love with a stranger  
I can't believe she's mine, yeah  
And now all I see is you with fresh eyes, fresh eyes
