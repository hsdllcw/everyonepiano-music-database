### Supermarket Flowers歌词：

I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill  
Threw the day-old tea from the cup  
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made  
Memories of a life that's been loved  
Took the "Get Well Soon" cards and stuffed animals  
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink  
Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when you're down."  
But, mum, there's a tear every time that I blink  
Oh, I'm in pieces. It's tearing me up but I know  
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved  
So, I'll sing Hallelujah,  
You were an angel in the shape of my mum  
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up  
Spread your wings as you go  
And when God takes you back  
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home."  
I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up  
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case  
John said he'd drive, then put his hand on my cheek  
And wiped a tear from the side of my face  
I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know  
A life with love is a life that's been lived  
So, I'll sing Hallelujah,  
You were an angel in the shape of my mum  
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up  
Spread your wings as you go, when God takes you back  
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home."  
Hallelujah,  
You were an angel in the shape of my mum  
You got to see the person I have become  
Spread your wings and I know  
That when God took you back, he said, "Hallelujah, you're home."
