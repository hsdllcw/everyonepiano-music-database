### Black Magic歌词：

All the girls on the block knocking at my door!  
Wanna know what it is make the boys want more!  
[Perrie:]  
Is your lover playing on your side?  
Said he loves you,  
But he ain't got time.  
Here's the answer.  
Come and get it  
At a knocked down price.  
Hey!  
[Jade:]  
Full of honey,  
Just to make him sweet.  
Crystal balling,  
Just to help him see  
What he's been missing.  
So come and get it,  
While you've still got time.  
Hey!  
[Leigh-Anne:]  
Get your boy on his knees  
And repeat after me, say  
[All:]  
Take a sip of my secret potion,  
I'll make you fall in love.  
For a spell that can't be broken,  
One drop should be enough.  
Boy, you belong to me,  
I got the recipe  
And it's called black magic  
(and it's called black magic)  
Take a sip of my secret potion,  
One taste and you'll be mine.  
It's a spell that can't be broken  
It'll keep you up all night  
Boy, you belong to me,  
I got the recipe  
And it's called black magic  
(and it's called black magic)  
[Jesy:]  
If you're lookin' for Mr. Right,  
Need that magic  
To change him over night.  
Here's the answer.  
Come and get it,  
While you've still got time.  
Hey!  
[Leigh-Anne:]  
Get your boy on his knees  
And repeat after me, say  
[All:]  
Take a sip of my secret potion,  
I'll make you fall in love.  
For a spell that can't be broken,  
One drop should be enough.  
Boy, you belong to me,  
I got the recipe  
And it's called black magic  
(and it's called black magic)  
Take a sip of my secret potion,  
One taste and you'll be mine.  
It's a spell that can't be broken  
It'll keep you up all night  
Boy, you belong to me,  
I got the recipe  
And it's called black magic  
(and it's called black magic)  
[Leigh-Anne:]  
All the girls on the block knockin' at my door!  
(I got the recipe)  
Wanna know what it is make the boys want more!  
(now you belong to me) [2x]  
[Leigh-Anne:]  
Take a sip from my secret potion,  
I'll make you fall in love.  
For a spell that can't be broken,  
One drop should be enough.  
Boy, you belong to me (hey!)  
I got the recipe.  
And it's called (black magic), and it's called, and it's called black magic!  
[All:]  
Take a sip of my secret potion,  
One taste and you'll be mine.  
It's a spell that can't be broken  
It'll keep you up all night  
Boy, you belong to me (belong to me)

And it's called black magic
