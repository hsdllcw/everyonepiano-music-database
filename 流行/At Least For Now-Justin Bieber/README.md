**At Least For Now** 是由加拿大流行男歌手Justin Bieber录唱的一首歌曲，被收录在Justin
Bieber尚未发行的第五张录音室专辑《Changes》，为专辑中的第16首歌曲。

此次专辑风格很齐全，既有简单的吉他扫弦风格，也有节奏感重的R&B风格。旋律制作的也是相当用心，相比Purpose浓重的电子风格我觉得这次的更好，给人一种沉稳的感觉。大概，Justin就是想通过音乐来表达自己人生的另一个阶段！

### At Least For Now歌词：

I'm concerned when you look at my face  
You're excited for no reason  
I look lost with a drink in my hand  
What you think is fair ain't even even  
It's cold outside from my expression  
Take the scarf and wrap it around my neck  
Loosen up my tie  
At least for now  
Trying to avoid disappointment  
At least for now  
One finger at a time I turn the pages yeah  
Right leg crossed while you're smoking a cigarette  
Camera's on the couch ain't nobody taking pictures  
Throw my arms around you bear witness  
The stripes on my shirt can you read between the lines  
You sip champagne while I sip on red wine  
Never mind me watching you never mind the tension  
Please excuse me while I dance I forgot to mention  
I'm going on strike  
At least for now  
Trying to avoid disappointment  
At least for now  
Yeah-yeah yeah-yeah yeah-yeah  
Yeah-yeah yeah-yeah yeah-ee  
Yeah-yeah yeah-yeah yeah-yeah  
At least for now at least for now oh
