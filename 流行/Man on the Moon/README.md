### Man on the Moon歌词：

What happens in dreams when we fly  
Never been a science tonight  
Staring through a window in time  
For someone to show me what I'm like  
He said "Hello" it's like a mirror in the sky  
And I can see this from up high  
Oh boy we looking good tonight  
And I just don't understand  
I met the man on the moon  
On the moon I heard him saying  
I met the man on the moon  
On the moon we'll be okay yeah  
I met the man on the moon on the moon  
I heard him saying  
I met the man on the moon on the moon  
We'll be okay yeah  
He said "Hello" it's like a mirror in the sky  
And I can see this from up high  
Oh boy we looking good tonight  
And I just don't understand  
I met the man on the moon  
On the moon I heard him saying  
I met the man on the moon  
On the moon we'll be okay yeah  
I met the man  
On the moon on the moon  
I heard him saying  
I met the man  
On the moon on the moon  
We'll be okay yeah  
I met the man on the moon he wore his set to the side  
I met the man on the moon he asked if I had a life  
He told us to hold it together we're falling apart  
He told us to light up the world when we dream in the dark  
I met the man on the moon  
On the moon I heard him saying  
I met the man on the moon  
On the moon we'll be okay yeah  
Lost  
All my tears have turned to dust  
Maybe somebody is calling us  
Man on the moon yeah  
Just the man on the moon
