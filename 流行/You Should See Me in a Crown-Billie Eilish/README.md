### You Should See Me in a Crown歌词：

Bite my tongue bide my time  
Wearing a warning sign  
Wait till the world is mine  
Visions I vandalize  
Cold in my kingdom size  
Fell for these ocean eyes  
You should see me in a crown  
I'm gonna run this nothing town  
Watch me make 'em bow  
One by one by one  
One by one by  
You should see me in a crown  
Your silence is my favorite sound  
Watch me make 'em bow  
One by one by one  
One by one by one  
Count my cards watch them fall  
Blood on a marble wall  
I like the way they all  
Scream  
Tell me which one is worse  
Living or dying first  
Sleeping inside a hearse  
I don't dream  
You say  
Come over baby  
I think you're pretty  
I'm okay  
I'm not your baby  
If you think I'm pretty  
You should see me in a crown  
I'm gonna run this nothing town  
Watch me make 'em bow  
One by one by one  
One by one by  
You should see me in a crown  
Your silence is my favorite sound  
Watch me make 'em bow  
One by one by one  
One by one by one  
Crown  
I'm gonna run this nothing town  
Watch me make 'em bow  
One by one by one  
One by one by  
You should see me in a crown  
Your silence is my favorite sound  
Watch me make 'em bow  
One by one by one  
One by one by one
