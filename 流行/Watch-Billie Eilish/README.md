**Watch双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Watch_ 是美国环球旗下流行女歌手Billie
Eilish的歌曲。空即静又幽，灵即流而动，幽幽的意境里又有强烈的节奏感；流动的音节里又似乎藏着细细低语。动中有静，
静中有动，动静结合，非常好听。开口一瞬，便抓了耳朵，却又在一首歌短短几分钟后悄然而去，不拂走一缕尘埃，不留下一丝痕迹，就像是一盅熬了良久的汤入了口，只留唇齿间那段流芳，惊艳了岁月，惊艳了时光。

### Watch歌词：

Lips meet teeth and tongue  
My heart skips eight beats at once  
If we were meant to be we would have been by now  
See what you wanna see but all I see is him right now  
I'll sit and watch your car burn  
With the fire that you started in me  
But you never came back to ask it out  
Go ahead and watch my heart burn  
With the fire that you started in me  
But I'll never let you back to put it out  
Your love feels so fake  
And my demands aren't high to make  
If I could get to sleep I would have slept by now  
Your lies will never keep I think you need to blow 'em out  
I'll sit and watch your car burn  
With the fire that you started in me  
But you never came back to ask it out  
Go ahead and watch my heart burn  
With the fire that you started in me  
But I'll never let you back to put it out  
When you call my name  
Do you think I'll come runnin'  
You never did the same  
So good at giving me nothing  
When you close your eyes do you picture me  
When you fantasize am I your fantasy  
Now you know  
Now I'm free  
I'll sit and watch your car burn  
With the fire that you started in me  
But you never came back to ask it out  
Watch my heart burn  
With the fire that you started in me  
But I'll never let you back to put it out  
Never let you burn  
Let you burn let you burn  
Never gonna let you burn  
Let you burn
