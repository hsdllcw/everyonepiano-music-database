### Cannonball歌词：

Breakdown. Breakdown.  
Breakdown. I was scared to death,  
I was losing my mind.  
Breakdown. I couldn't close my eyes,  
I was pacing all night.  
Woah-oh. I think I found the light at the end of the tunnel.  
Woah-oh. I couldn't find the truth,  
I was going under.  
But I won't hide inside.  
I gotta get out, gotta get out.  
gotta get out. gotta get out.  
Lonely inside and light the fuse.  
Light it now. Light it now. Light it now.  
And now I will start living today.  
Today. Today. I close the door.  
I got this new beginning and  
I will fly, i will fly, like a cannonball.  
Like a cannonball. Like a cannonball.  
I'll fly, I'll fly, I'll fly, like a cannonball  
I won't hide inside.  
I gotta get out, gotta get out.  
gotta get out. gotta get out.  
Lonely inside and light the fuse.  
Light it now. Light it now. Light it now.  
And now I will start living today.  
Today. Today. I close the door.  
I got this new beginning and  
I will fly, i will fly, like a cannonball.  
Like a cannonball. Like a cannonball.  
I'll fly, I'll fly, I'll fly, like a cannonball  
Breakdown. I was scared to death,  
I was losing my mind.  
And now I will start living today.  
Today. Today. I close the door.  
I got this new beginning and  
I will fly, i will fly, like a cannonball.  
Like a cannonball. Like a cannonball.  
I'll fly, I'll fly, I'll fly, like a cannonball  
like a cannonball  
like a cannonball  
I'll fly, I'll fly, I'll fly, like a cannonball
