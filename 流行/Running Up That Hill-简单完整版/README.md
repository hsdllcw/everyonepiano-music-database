### Running Up That Hill歌词：

It doesn't hurt me  
Do you want to feel how it feels  
Do you want to know know that it doesn't hurt me  
Do you want to hear about the deal that I'm making  
You it's you and me  
And if I only could  
I'd make a deal with God  
And I'd get him to swap our places  
Be running up that road  
Be running up that hill  
Be running up that building  
See if I only could oh  
You don't want to hurt me  
But see how deep the bullet lies  
Unaware I'm tearing you asunder  
Ooh there is thunder in our hearts  
Is there so much hate for the ones we love  
Tell me we both matter don't we  
You it's you and me  
It's you and me won't be unhappy  
And if I only could  
I'd make a deal with God  
And I'd get him to swap our places  
Be running up that road  
Be running up that hill  
Be running up that building  
Say if I only could oh  
You  
It's you and me  
It's you and me won't be unhappy  
Oh come on baby  
Oh come on darling  
Let me steal this moment from you now  
Oh come on angel  
Come on come on darling  
Let's exchange the experience oh  
And if I only could  
I'd make a deal with God  
And I'd get him to swap our places  
I'd be running up that road  
Be running up that hill  
With no problems  
Say if I only could  
I'd make a deal with God  
And I'd get him to swap our places  
I'd be running up that road  
Be running up that hill  
With no problems  
So if I only could  
I'd make a deal with God  
And I'd get him to swap our places  
I'd be running up that road  
Be running up that hill  
With no problems  
Say if I only could  
I'd be running up that hill  
With no problems
