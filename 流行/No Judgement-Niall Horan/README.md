### No Judgement歌词：

Barefoot and a bottle of wine  
You can stay with me tonight  
You don't have to change when I'm around ya  
So go ahead and say what's on your mind on your mind  
When you're with me no judgement  
You can get that from anyone else  
You don't have to prove nothin'  
You can just be yourself  
When you're with me no judgement  
We can get that from everyone else  
And we don't have to prove nothin'  
When you're with me no judgement  
Mm oh we don't have to prove nothin'  
Mm when you're with me no judgement  
I get us breakfast in the morning  
Or you can slip out in the night  
You don't have to give me a warning  
'Cause we both got nothing to hide nothing to hide  
Even though we don't talk for a couple of months yeah  
It's like we don't lose any time  
I can be your lover or your shoulder to cry on  
You can be whoever you like oh  
When you're with me no judgement  
You can get that from anyone else  
You don't have to prove nothin'  
You can just be yourself  
When you're with me no judgement  
We can get that from everyone else  
And we don't have to prove nothin'  
When you're with me no judgement  
Mm oh we don't have to prove nothin'  
Mm when you're with me no judgement  
I hope we never change  
Even though we both know that we'll move on  
I'll keep your secrets safe  
Until the time we both find ourselves alone again oh  
When you're with me no judgement  
You can get that from anyone else  
You don't have to prove nothin'  
You can just be yourself  
When you're with me no judgement  
We can get that from everyone else  
And we don't have to prove nothin'  
When you're with me no judgement  
Mm oh we don't have to prove nothin'  
Mm when you're with me no judgement  
Mm oh we don't have to prove nothin'  
Mm when you're with me no judgement
