《 **Gravity** 》是莎拉·巴莱勒斯（Sara Bareilles）在2007年七月份推出的专辑《Little Voice》中的歌曲。

Sara Bareilles是出生在尤里卡加利福尼亚西北部城市洪堡的一名创作歌手和钢琴家。她经常被拿来与Fiona Apple, Norah Jones,
Joni Mitchell这些与她同类型的知名歌手比较，即便她并没有受过任何正式的声乐和钢琴训练。 在BILLBOARD被HIP-HOP统治的情况下Sara
Bareilles凭借LOVE
SONG连续几周徘徊在榜单前十，给美国乐坛注入一股清新之风，没有太过花俏繁复、哗众取宠的编曲，突显钢琴的透明与纯净，添份夜晚清凉聆听享受，赶走白日喧闹繁杂恼人之事。是值得一听的新生代女歌手。

Gravity歌词：

  
Something always brings me back to you.

It never takes too long.

No matter what I say or do

I'll still feel you here 'til the moment I'm gone.

You hold me without touch.

You keep me without chains.

I never wanted anything so much than to drown in your love

and not feel your rain.

Set me free, leave me be.

I don't want to fall another moment into your gravity.

Here I am and I stand so tall,

just the way I'm supposed to be.

But you're on to me and all over me.

Oh You loved me 'cause I'm fragile.

When I thought that I was strong.

But you touch me for a little while

and all my fragile strength is gone.

Set me free, leave me be.

I don't want to fall another moment into your gravity.

Here I am and I stand so tall,

just the way I'm supposed to be.

But you're on to me and all over me.

I live here on my knees as I try to make you see that

you're everything I think I need here on the ground.

But you're neither friend nor foe though I can't seem to let you go.

The one thing that I still know is that you're keeping me down

Hu~

keeping me down... yeah yeah yeah

But you're on to me on to me and all over me

Something always brings me back to you.

It never takes too long...
