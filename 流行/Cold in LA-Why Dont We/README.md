LA封面是Jonah的纹身梧桐树，因为一棵冰冷的梧桐树在洛杉矶代表寒冷。其实在都柏林演出之前就开始写这首歌了，并且当晚就完成了创作，当天洛杉矶真的很冷，并且正在下着倾盆大雨。

### Cold in LA歌词：

Daniel Seavey：  
I'm a little bit shy  
I'm a little bit right on time  
And I know that you don't operate the same  
Are you feeling alright  
'Cause I really can't tell sometimes  
I wanna know what's going on inside your brain  
Just come a little bit closer  
'Cause I don't know if I know you yet  
Yet there seems to be something new everyday  
Why do I really wanna hold you  
Why do I want you so bad  
Yeah you're beautiful but something's in my way  
Jack Avery：  
Yeah we started with a good night  
Then it turned to day  
Never thought that we would  
Ever say the things we say  
'Til we talk about them  
Here just staring face to face  
Why don't you just stay with me  
Jonah Marais：  
Don't walk away  
'Cause it's cold in LA  
Every time that you leave me behind  
Just stay at my place  
'Cause I can tell by the way  
You're lookin' at me you'll be fine  
Corbyn Besson：  
Is your body talking  
'Cause you don't know what to say  
Do you do this often  
Is it all just a game to you I'm wondering  
Never seen this sort of thing  
Am I the only one you came to see  
Jack Avery：  
Yeah we started with a good night  
Then it turned to day  
Never thought that we would  
Ever say the things we say  
'Til we talk about them  
Here just staring face to face  
Why don't you just stay with me  
Jonah Marais：  
Don't walk away  
'Cause it's cold in LA  
Every time that you leave me behind  
Just stay at my place  
'Cause I can tell by the way  
You're lookin' at me you'll be fine  
Corbyn Besson/Jonah Marais：  
I I I I I I  
You'll be fine either way  
I I I  
But I wish you'd stay  
No no no  
No no no  
Oh oh  
Zach Herron：  
Yeah it started with a good night  
Then it turned to day  
Never thought that we would  
Ever say the things we say  
'Til we talk about them  
Here just staring face to face  
Why don't you just stay with me  
Jonah Marais/Jack Avery：  
Don't walk away  
'Cause it's cold in LA  
Every time that you leave me behind  
Just stay at my place  
Stay at my place oh  
'Cause I can tell by the way  
You're lookin' at me you'll be fine  
You'll be fine either way  
Corbyn Besson/Jonah Marais：  
'Cause it's cold in LA  
Every time that you leave me behind  
You'll be fine either way  
Just stay at my place  
'Cause I can tell by the way  
Oh will you stay  
You lookin' at me you'd be fine
