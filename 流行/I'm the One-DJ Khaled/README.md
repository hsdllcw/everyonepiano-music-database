### I'm the One歌词：

We The Best Music  
Another One!  
DJ Khaled  
Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth, the money never lie, no  
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one  
Early mornin' in the dawn, know you wanna ride now. (Let's ride.)  
I'm the one, yeah. (Let's ride.)  
I'm the one, yeah  
Yeah, you're sick of all those other imitators  
Don't let the only real one intimidate you  
See you watchin', don't run outta time now  
I'm the one, yeah, oh-eh-oh oh-eh-oh  
I'm the one oh-eh-oh oh-eh-oh  
I'm the only one oh-eh-oh oh-eh-oh  
I'm the one oh-eh-oh oh-eh-oh  
I'm the only one  
Yo, yo. Quavo  
I'm the one that hit that same spot. Hit it.  
She the one that bring them rain drops, rain drops.  
We go back, remember criss-cross and hopscotch, hopscotch?  
You the one that hold me down when the block's hot, hot.  
I make your dreams come true when you wake up. Dream.  
And your look's just the same without no make up, eh.  
Had to pull up on your mama, see what you're made of. Mama.  
Ain't gotta worry 'bout 'em commas 'cause my cake up, hey  
You can run inside my life from that fame bus  
'Cause I promise when we step out you'll be famous, yeah  
Modern day Bonnie and Clyde what they named us. Why?  
'Cause when we pull up—prr prr—all angles  
Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth, the money never lie, no  
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one  
Early mornin' in the dawn, know you wanna ride now. (Let's ride.)  
I'm the one, yeah. (Let's ride.)  
I'm the one, yeah  
Yeah, you're sick of all those other imitators  
Don't let the only real one intimidate you  
See you watchin', don't run outta time now  
I'm the one, yeah, oh-eh-oh oh-eh-oh  
I'm the one oh-eh-oh oh-eh-oh  
I'm the only one oh-eh-oh oh-eh-oh  
I'm the one oh-eh-oh oh-eh-oh  
I'm the only one  
Okay, though  
She beat her face out with that new Chanel  
She like the price, she see the ice, it make her coochie melt  
When I met her in the club I asked her who she felt  
Then she went and put that booty on that Gucci belt  
We don't got no label  
She say she want bottles, she ain't got no table  
She don't got no bed frame, she don't got no tables  
We just watching Netflix, she ain't got no cable. Okay, though.  
Plug, plug, plug, I'm the plug for her  
She want a nigga that pull her hair and hold the door for her  
Baby, that's only me, bitch, it okay with me  
Baby, okay, okay though  
Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth, the money never lie, no  
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one  
Early mornin' in the dawn, know you wanna ride now. (Let's ride.)  
I'm the one, yeah. (Let's ride.)  
I'm the one, yeah  
Yeah, you're sick of all those other imitators  
Don't let the only real one intimidate you  
See you watchin', don't run outta time now  
I'm the one, yeah, oh-eh-oh oh-eh-oh  
I'm the one oh-eh-oh oh-eh-oh  
I'm the only one oh-eh-oh oh-eh-oh  
I'm the one oh-eh-oh oh-eh-oh  
I'm the only one  
Lookin' for the one, well, bitch, you're looking at the one  
I'm the best yet and yet my best is yet to come  
'Cause I've been lookin' for somebody, not just any-fuckin'-body  
Don't make me catch a body, that's for any and everybody  
Oh my God! She hit me up all day, get no response  
Bitch you blow my high, that's like turning gold to bronze  
Roll my eyes  
And when she on the molly she a zombie  
She think we Clyde and Bonnie but it's more like Whitney Bobby  
God forgive me  
Tunechi and finessin', I'm a legend  
Straight up out The Crescent, fly your bae down for the Essence  
For the record I knew Khaled when that boy was spinnin' records  
Moolah gang winning record, I'm just flexing on my exes, oh, God  
Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth, the money never lie, no  
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one  
Early mornin' in the dawn, know you wanna ride now. (Let's ride.)  
I'm the one, yeah. (Let's ride.)  
I'm the one, yeah  
Yeah, you're sick of all those other imitators  
Don't let the only real one intimidate you  
See you watchin', don't run outta time now  
I'm the one, yeah, oh-eh-oh oh-eh-oh  
I'm the one oh-eh-oh oh-eh-oh  
I'm the only one oh-eh-oh oh-eh-oh  
I'm the one oh-eh-oh oh-eh-oh  
I'm the only one  
(Another one)  
Don't you know, girl, don't you know, girl  
I am the one for you (I'm the one), yeah, I'm the one  
Don't you know, girl, don't you know, girl  
I am the one for you (I'm the one), yeah, I'm the one  
Don't you know, girl, don't you know, girl  
I am the one for you (I'm the one), yeah, I'm the one  
Don't you know, girl, don't you know, girl  
I am the one for you (I'm the one), yeah, I'm the one
