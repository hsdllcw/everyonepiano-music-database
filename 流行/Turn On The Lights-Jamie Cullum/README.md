### Turn On The Lights歌词：

Turn on the lights turn on the lights  
I wanna feel that Winter solstice high  
Can it make everything alright  
Show me reindeer flying through the midnight sky  
We've got a dream that comes back every year  
Falling pines needles and stockings full of cheer  
I want it all until it disappears  
For it's gone gone gone  
Another Christmas is around the corner  
And I can feel us darling getting closer  
It's coming down the road and stopping it now  
Stopping it now is impossible  
I built a snowman out the back  
It came alive and followed me round this sleepy town  
I put an old star found it's snack  
And every time you kiss me my head turns upside down  
We've got a dream that comes back every year  
Falling pines needles and stockings full of cheer  
I want it all until it disappears  
For it's gone gone gone  
Another Christmas is around the corner  
And I can feel us darling getting closer  
It's coming down the road and stopping it now  
Stopping it now is impossible  
Another Christmas is around the corner  
And I can feel us darling getting closer  
It's coming down the road and stopping it now  
Stopping it now is impossible  
Turn on the lights turn on the lights  
Time to turn on all the lights all the lights  
Turn on the lights turn on the lights  
Time to turn on all the lights all the lights  
Turn on the lights turn on the lights  
Time to turn on all the lights all the lights  
Turn on the lights turn on the lights  
Time to turn on all the lights all the lights  
Turn on the lights turn on the lights  
Time to turn on all the lights all the lights  
Turn on the lights turn on the lights  
Another Christmas is around the corner  
And I can feel us darling getting closer  
It's coming down the road and stopping it now  
Stopping it now is impossible  
Another Christmas is around the corner  
And I can feel us darling getting closer  
It's coming down the road and stopping it now  
Stopping it now is impossible  
Turn on the lights turn on the lights  
Time to turn on all the lights all the lights  
Turn on the lights turn on the lights  
Time to turn on all the lights all the lights  
Turn on the lights turn on the lights  
Time to turn on all the lights all the lights  
Turn on the lights turn on the lights  
Time to turn on all the lights all the lights
