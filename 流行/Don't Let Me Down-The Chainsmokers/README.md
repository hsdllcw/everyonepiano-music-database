### Don't Let Me Down歌词：

Crashing, hit a wall  
Right now I need a miracle  
Hurry up now, I need a miracle  
Stranded, reaching out  
I call your name but you're not around  
I say your name but you're not around

I need ya, I need ya, I need you right now  
Yeah, I need you right now  
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down  
I think I'm losing my mind now  
It's in my head, darling, I hope  
That you'll be here, when I need you the most  
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down  
D-don't let me down

Don't let me down  
Don't let me down, down, down  
Don't let me down, don't let me down, down, down

Running out of time  
I really thought you were on my side  
But now there's nobody by my side

I need ya, I need ya, I need you right now  
Yeah, I need you right now  
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down  
I think I'm losing my mind now  
It's in my head, darling, I hope  
That you'll be here, when I need you the most  
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down  
D-don't let me down

Don't let me down  
Don't let me down, down, down  
Don't let me down, down, down  
Don't let me down, down, down  
Don't let me down, don't let me down, down, down

Ooh, I think I'm losing my mind now, yeah  
Ooh, I think I'm losing my mind now, yeah

I need ya, I need ya, I need you right now  
Yeah, I need you right now  
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down  
I think I'm losing my mind now  
It's in my head, darling, I hope  
That you'll be here, when I need you the most  
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down  
Don't let me down

Yeah, don't let me down  
Yeah, don't let me down  
Don't let me down, oh, no  
Said don't let me down  
Don't let me down

Don't let me down  
Don't let me down, down, down
