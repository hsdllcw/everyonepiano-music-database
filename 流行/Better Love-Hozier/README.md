### Better Love歌词:

I once kneeled in shaking thrill  
Chase the memory of it still, of every chill  
Chided by the silence of the hush, the blind  
Blind to the purpose of the brute divine  
But you were mine  
Staring at the blackness of some distant star  
The thrill of knowing how alone we are  
Unknown we are  
To the one and to the both of us  
I confessed so long that I was dreaming of...

Some better love, but there's no better love  
Beckons above me and there's no better love  
That ever has loved me, there's no better love  
Darling, feel better love!  
Feel better love!

I've never loved a darker blue  
Than the darkness I've known in you  
Owned from you  
You whose heart would sing of anarchy  
You who'd laugh at meanings, guaranteeds, so beautifully  
When our truth is burned from history  
By those who've figured justice in fond memory  
Witness me  
Like fire weeping from a Cedar tree  
Knowing that my love would burn with me  
We'll live eternally

Cause there's no better love  
That beckons above me, there's no better love  
That ever has loved me, there's no better love  
So darling, feel better love  
Cause there's no better love  
That's laid beside me, there's no better love  
Justifies me, there's no better love

So darling, darling, feel better love  
Feel better love

Feel better love....  
Feel better love....  
Feel better love....

'Cause there's no better love  
That beckons above me, there's no better love  
That ever has loved me, there's no better love  
So darling, feel better love  
Cause there's no better love  
That's laid beside me, there's no better love  
Justifies me, there's no better love  
So darling, darling, feel better love

(Feel better love...)
