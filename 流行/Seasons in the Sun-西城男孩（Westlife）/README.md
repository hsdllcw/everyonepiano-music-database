Goodbye to you my trusted friend再见了，我的挚友  
We've known each other since we were nine or ten我们九岁十岁时就相识

When all the birds are singing in the sky当所有的鸟儿都在天空歌唱时  
Now that spring is in the air春天就弥漫在那空气中  
Pretty girls are everywhere到处都会有可爱的女孩  
Think of me and I'll be there想起我，我就会出现在那里  
We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun我们曾拥有幸福快乐，也曾拥有阳光下的季节  
But the hills that we climbed were just seasons out of
time但我们爬过的那些山，只是时光外的季节罢了
