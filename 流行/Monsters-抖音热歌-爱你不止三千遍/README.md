### Monsters歌词：

I see your monsters I see your pain  
Tell me your problems I'll chase them away  
I'll be your lighthouse  
I'll make it okay  
When I see your monsters  
I'll stand there so brave  
And chase them all away  
In the dark we we  
We stand apart we we  
Never see that the things we need are staring right at us  
You just want to hide hide  
Hide never show your smile smile  
Stand alone when you need someone it's the hardest thing of all  
That you see are the bad bad  
Bad memories take your time and you'll find me  
I see your monsters I see your pain  
Tell me your problems I'll chase them away  
I'll be your lighthouse I'll make it okay  
When I see your monsters I'll stand there so brave  
And chase them all away  
I could see the sky sky  
Sky beautiful tonight night  
When you breathe why can't you see that the clouds are in your head  
I would stay there there  
There's no need to fear fear  
And when you need to talk it out with someone you can trust  
What you see are the bad bad  
Bad memories take your time and you'll find me  
I see your monsters I see your pain  
Tell me your problems I'll chase them away  
I'll be your lighthouse I'll make it okay  
When I see your monsters I'll stand there so brave  
And chase them all away  
I'll chase them all away  
You've got the chance to see the light  
Even in the darkest night  
And I'll be here like you were for me  
So just let me in  
Cause I see your monsters I see your pain  
Tell me your problems I'll chase them away  
I'll be your lighthouse I'll make it okay  
When I see your monsters I'll stand there so brave  
I see your monsters I see your pain  
Tell me your problems I'll chase them away  
I'll be your lighthouse I'll make it okay  
When I see your monsters I'll stand there so brave  
And chase them all away
