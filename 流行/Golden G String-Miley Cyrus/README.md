### Golden G String歌词：

I woke up in Montecito  
I was thinkin' about my life  
And the questions made more questions  
Starin' out into the night  
Yes I've worn the golden g-string  
Put my hand into hellfire  
I did it all to make you love me and to feel alive  
Oh that's just the world that we're livin' in  
The old boys hold all the cards and they ain't playin' gin  
You dare to call me crazy have you looked around this place  
I should walk away  
Oh I should walk away  
But I think I'll stay  
There are layers to this body  
Primal sex and primal shame  
They told me I should cover it  
So I went the other way  
I was tryin' to own my power  
Still I'm tryin' to work it out  
And at least it gives the paper somethin' they can write about  
And oh that's just the world that we're livin' in  
The old boys hold all the cards and they ain't playin' gin  
And you dare to call me crazy have you looked around this place  
I should walk away  
Oh I should walk away  
But I think I'll stay  
So the mad man is in the big chair  
And his heart's an iron vault  
He says "If you can't make ends meet honey it must be your fault"  
We all focus on the winners  
And get blinded by their shine  
Maybe caring for each other is just too 1969  
But oh that's just the world that we're livin' in  
The old boys hold all the cards and they ain't playin' gin  
And you dare to call me crazy have you looked around this place  
I should walk away  
Oh I should walk away  
But I think I'll stay  
And I think I'll stay yeah  
I have too much lose  
So I think I'll stay  
I can't walk away
