### Here, There and Everywhere歌词：

To lead a better life I need my love to be here...

Here, making each day of the year  
Changing my life with the wave of her hand  
Nobody can deny that there's something there

There, running my hands through her hair  
Both of us thinking how good it can be  
Someone is speaking but she doesn't know he's there

I want her everywhere and if she's beside me  
I know I need never care  
But to love her is to need her everywhere  
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies  
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I want her everywhere and if she's beside me  
I know I need never care  
But to love her is to need her everywhere  
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies  
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there and everywhere  
Here, there and everywhere
