### International Love歌词：

Went from Mr. 305, Dade County, to Mr. Worldwide, all around the world  
[Chris Brown, in background:] Ay ay, yeah ah!  
Now we're international, so international, international, so international,

[Chorus — Chris Brown:]  
You put it down like New York City  
I never sleep!  
Wild like Los Angeles  
My fantasy!  
Hotter than Miami  
I feel the heat!  
Oh, it's international love  
Oh, it's international love

[Pitbull:]  
I don't play football but I've touched down pretty much all around the world,
all around the world!  
I don't play baseball but I've hit a home run all around the world, all around
the world.  
I've been to countries and cities I can't pronounce  
And the places on the globe I didn't know existed.  
In Romania she pulled me to the side and told me, "Pit, you can have me and my
sister."  
In Lebanon, yeah, the women are bomb  
And in Greece–you've guessed it–the women are sweet.  
Been all around the world but I ain't gon' lie–there's nothing like Miami's
heat.

[Chorus — Chris Brown:]  
You put it down like New York City  
I never sleep!  
Wild like Los Angeles  
My fantasy!  
Hotter than Miami  
I feel the heat!  
Oh, it's international love  
Oh, yeah, it's international love

[Pitbull:]  
Down in D.R. they're looking for visas,  
I ain't talking credit cards if you know what I mean!  
En Cuba, la cosa esta dura!  
But the woman get down, if you know what I mean!  
In Colombia the women got everything done but they are some of the most
beautiful women I've ever seen  
In Brazil they're freaky with big old boobs and their thongs, blue yellow and
green!  
In L.A. tengo la Mexicana, en New York tengo la boricua  
Besito para todas las mujeres en Venezuela, muah!  
Y en Miami tengo a cualquiera!

[Chorus — Chris Brown:]  
You put it down like New York City  
I never sleep!  
Wild like Los Angeles  
My fantasy!  
Hotter than Miami  
I feel the heat!  
Oh, it's international love  
Oh, yeah, it's international love

[Chris Brown:]  
There's not a place that your love don't affect me, baby  
So don't ever change  
I'll cross the globe when I'm with you, baby  
Hey, whoa-oh

[Chorus — Chris Brown (2x):]  
You put it down like New York City  
I never sleep!  
Wild like Los Angeles  
My fantasy!  
Hotter than Miami  
I feel the heat!  
Oh, it's international love  
Oh, yeah, it's international love

We're international, so international, international, so international,  
We're international, so international,  
International love  
International love
