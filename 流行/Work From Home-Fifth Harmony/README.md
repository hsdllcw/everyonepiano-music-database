### Work From Home歌词：

I ain't worried 'bout nothin'  
I ain't wearin' na-nada  
I'm sittin' pretty, impatient, but I know you gotta  
Put in them hours, I'mma make it hotter  
I'm sending pic after picture, I'mma get you fired  
I know you're always on the night shift  
But I can't stand these nights alone  
And I don't need no explanation  
Cause baby, you're the boss at home  
You don't gotta go to work, work, work, work  
Work, work, work  
But you gotta put in work, work, work, work  
Work, work, work  
You don't gotta go to work, work, work, work  
Work, work, work  
Let my body do the work, work, work, work  
Work, work, work  
We can work from home, oh, oh, oh-oh  
We can work from home, oh, oh, oh-oh  
Let's put it into motion  
I'mma give you a promotion  
I'll make it feel like a vacay, turn the bed into an ocean  
We don't need nobody, I just need your body  
Nothin' but sheets in between us, ain't no getting off early  
I know you're always on the night shift  
But I can't stand these nights alone  
And I don't need no explanation  
Cause baby, you're the boss at home  
You don't gotta go to work, work, work, work  
Work, work, work  
But you gotta put in work, work, work, work  
Work, work, work  
You don't gotta go to work, work, work, work  
Work, work, work  
Let my body do the work, work, work, work  
Work, work, work  
We can work from home, oh, oh, oh-oh  
We can work from home, oh, oh, oh-oh  
Oh yeah, girl you gotta work for me  
Can you make it clap, no hands for me?  
Take it to the ground, pick it up for me  
Look back at it all over me  
Put in work like my timesheet  
She ride it like a '63  
I'mma buy her new Céline  
Let her ride in a foreign with me  
Oh, she the bae, I'm her boo  
And she down to break the rules  
La-di-da she gon' go  
I'm on drugs, she finessin'  
I pipe up, she take that  
Putting overtime on your body  
You don't gotta go to work, work, work, work  
Work, work, work  
But you gotta put in work, work, work, work  
Work, work, work  
You don't gotta go to work, work, work, work  
Work, work, work  
Let my body do the work, work, work, work  
Work, work, work  
We can work from home, oh, oh, oh-oh  
We can work from home, oh, oh, oh-oh  
Yeah, we can work from home  
Yeah, we can work from home  
Yeah
