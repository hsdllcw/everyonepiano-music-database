### Honeymoon歌词：

We both know that it's not fashionable to love me  
But you don't go cause truly there's nobody for you but me  
We could cruise to the blues  
Wilshire Boulevard if we choose  
Or whatever you wanna do  
We make the rules

Our honeymoon  
Our honeymoon  
Our honeymoon

Say you want me too  
Say you want me too  
Dark blue  
Dark blue

We both know the history of violence that surrounds you  
But I'm not scared, there's nothing to lose now that I've found you  
And we could cruise to the news  
Pico Boulevard in your used little bullet car if we choose

Mr. Born to lose

Our honeymoon  
Our honeymoon  
Our honeymoon

Say you want me too  
Say you want me too  
Dark blue  
Dark blue

There are violets in your eyes  
There are guns that blaze around you  
There are roses in between my thighs and fire that surrounds you  
It's no wonder every man in town had neither fought nor found you

Everything you do is elusive, too, even your honey dew

Our honeymoon  
Our honeymoon  
Our honeymoon

Dreaming away your life  
Dreaming away your life  
Dreaming away your life
