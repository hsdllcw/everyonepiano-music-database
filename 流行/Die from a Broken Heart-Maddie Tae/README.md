### Die from a Broken Heart歌词：

Hey Momma how do you get a red wine stain  
Out of your favorite dress  
Black mascara off a pillow case  
Cure a one-too-many headache  
Momma can I come and maybe stay a few days  
This weekend or next  
And hey how do you get a red wine stain  
Out of your favorite dress  
How does he sleep at night  
Momma the nerve of this guy  
To leave me so easy  
Am I gonna be alright  
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard  
Momma can you die from a broken heart  
Can you ask Daddy if he's got time  
To come and look at my front door  
It got slammed last night  
And now it don't close right  
And just promise that you won't tell him everything  
And keep that pistol in the drawer  
Momma please don't say  
I'm gonna laugh about this someday  
You didn't see the way he drove away  
How does he sleep at night  
Momma the nerve of this guy  
To leave me so easy  
Am I gonna be alright  
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard  
Momma can you die from a broken heart  
Oh a broken heart  
Can your knees give out from praying so hard  
Praying so hard  
Can you go blind from crying in the dark  
Was it ever really real  
If he don't feel like I feel  
How does he sleep at night  
Momma the nerve of this guy  
To leave me so easy  
Am I gonna be alright  
How does he sleep at night  
Momma the nerve of this guy  
To leave me so easy  
Am I gonna be alright  
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard  
Momma can you die from a broken heart  
A broken heart
