### U.N.I.歌词：

I found your hair band on my bedroom floor  
The only evidence that you'd been here before  
And I don't get waves of missing you anymore  
They're more like tsunami tides  
In my eyes  
Never getting dry,  
So I get high,  
Smoke away the days, never sleep with the light on  
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye  
And I'm still drunk at the end of the night

I don't drink like everybody else  
I do it to forget things about myself  
Stumble and fall  
With the head spin I got,  
My mind's with you but my heart's just not

So am I close to you anymore if it's over?  
And there's no chance that we'll work it out

That's why you and I ended over U N I  
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied  
You and I ended over U N I  
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied

Everybody said we'd be together forever,  
But I know that I never wanna settle down,  
Come around, break up the love like Lego now  
Never wanna turn into another like you  
Sleep with my thoughts  
And I dance with my views  
Everything's great, not everything's sure,  
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus  
Now I'm in a position to be another stalker  
Like everything I say seems to all sound awkward  
Like our last kiss. It was perfect,  
But we were nervous on the surface  
And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it,  
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts  
I forget like an elephant  
Or we can use a sedative  
And go back to the day we fell in love just on our first kiss

So am I close to you anymore if it's over?  
And there's no chance that we'll work it out

You and I ended over U N I  
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied  
You and I ended over U N I  
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied

Wo-ooooahhhh [2x] oohh ohh

Because if I was gonna go somewhere,  
I'd be there by now  
And maybe I can let myself down  
And I'm thinking that I'm unaware,  
I keep my feet on the ground  
And keep looking around  
To make sure I'm not the only one to feel low

Because if you want,  
I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered  
From all that I've done wrong  
And I know you'll say  
That I'm the only one,  
But I know God made another one of me to love you better than I ever will

'Cause you and I ended over U N I  
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied  
You and I ended over U N I  
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied
