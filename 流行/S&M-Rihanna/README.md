### S&M歌词：

Na-na-na come on  
Na-na-na come on  
Na-na-na-na-na come on  
Na-na-na come on, come on, come on  
Na-na-na-na come on  
Na-na-na come on  
Na-na-na-na-na come on  
Na-na-na come on, come on, come on  
Na-na-na  
It's so good being back (Oh...)  
Cause no way I'm turning back (Oh...)  
And now the pain is my pleasure  
Cause nothing could measure (Oh...)  
Love is great, love is fine (Oh...)  
Out the box, out the line (Oh...)  
The affliction of the feeling  
Leaves me wanting more (Oh...)  
Cause I may be bad  
But I'm perfectly good at it  
Sex in the air, I don't care  
I love the smell of it  
Sticks and stones may break my bones  
But chains and whips excite me  
Cause I may be bad  
But I'm perfectly good at it  
Sex in the air, I don't care  
I love the smell of it  
Sticks and stones may break my bones  
But chains and whips excite me  
Na-na-na come on, come on, come on  
I like it, like it, come on...  
I like it, like it, come on...  
I like it, like it, come on...  
I like it, like it  
Love is great, love is fine (Oh...)  
Out the box, out the line (Oh...)  
The affliction of the feeling  
Leaves me wanting more (Oh...)  
Cause I may be bad  
But I'm perfectly good at it  
Sex in the air, I don't care  
I love the smell of it  
Sticks and stones may break my bones  
But chains and whips excite me  
Na-na-na come on, come on, come on  
I like it, like it, come on...  
I like it, like it, come on...  
I like it, like it, come on...  
I like it, like it  
S-S-S&M-M-M...S-S-S&M-M-M ...  
Oh, I love the feeling you bring to me  
Oh, you turn me on  
It's exactly what I've been yearning for  
Give it to me strong  
And meet me in my boudoir  
With my body suit on-on-on  
I like it, like it  
Cause I may be bad  
But I'm perfectly good at it  
Sex in the air, I don't care  
I love the smell of it  
Sticks and stones may break my bones  
But chains and whips excite me  
Cause I may be bad  
But I'm perfectly good at it  
Sex in the air, I don't care  
I love the smell of it  
Sticks and stones may break my bones  
But chains and whips excite me  
Na-na-na come on, come on, come on  
I like it, like it, come on...  
I like it, like it, come on...  
I like it, like it, come on...  
I like it, like it  
S-S-S&M-M-M...S-S-S&M-M-M...
