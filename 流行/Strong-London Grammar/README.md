_Strong_ 收录于London Grammar的首张专辑《If You Wait》。London Grammar
是一支来自英国的新晋独立乐队，三名成员在上大学时相遇，并于2012年成立乐队。他们的音乐是种慢板的、迷幻的、有jazz感觉的、迷糊的、带点Hip-
Hop节奏的碎拍节奏（Break beat）音乐。他们的音乐内敛又奔放，忧郁飘渺的吉他与唱腔搭配伤感哀怨的歌词，营造出氛围音乐与古典美的完美结合。

### Strong歌词：

Excuse me for a while  
While I'm wide eyed and I'm so damn caught in the middle  
I've excused you for a while  
While I'm wide eyed and I'm so damn caught in the middle  
And a lion a lion roars  
Would you not listen  
If a child a child cries  
Would you not forgive them  
Yeah I might seem so strong  
Yeah I might speak so long  
I've never been so wrong  
Yeah I might seem so strong  
Yeah I might speak so long  
I've never been so wrong  
Excuse me for a while  
Turn a blind eye with a stare caught right in the middle  
Have you wondered for a while  
I have a feeling deep down you're caught in the middle  
If a lion a lion roars  
Would you not listen  
If a child a child cries  
Would you not forgive them  
Yeah I might seem so strong  
Yeah I might speak so long  
I've never been so wrong  
Yeah I might seem so strong  
Yeah I might speak so long  
I've never been so wrong  
Excuse me for a while  
While I'm wide eyed and I'm so damn caught in the middle  
Have you wondered for a while  
I have a feeling deep down you're caught in the middle  
Yeah I might seem so strong  
Yeah I might speak so long  
I've never been so wrong  
Yeah I might seem so strong  
Yeah I might speak so long  
I've never been so wrong
