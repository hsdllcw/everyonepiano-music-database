### Holy Grail歌词：

You take the clothes off my back  
And I let you  
You steal the food right out of my mouth  
And I watch you eat it  
I still don't know why  
Why our love is so much  
Oh…  
You curse my name  
In spite to put me to shame  
Air all my laundry in the streets  
Dirty or clean  
Give it up for fame  
But I still don't know why  
Why I love it so much  
Yeah  
And Baby  
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you  
I just can't crack the code  
One day you screaming you love me loud  
The next day you're so cold  
One day you here, one day you there, one day you care  
You're so unfair sipping from the cup  
Till it runneth over, Holy Grail  
Blue told me to remind you niggas  
Fuck that shit y'all talk about  
I'm the shit, caught up in all these lights and cameras  
But look what that shit did to Hammer  
…it I like it  
The bright lights is enticing  
But look what it did to Tyson  
All that money in one night  
30 mill for one fight  
But soon as all the money blows  
All the pigeons take flight  
Keep the fame, keep cheating on me  
What I do, I took her back, fool me twice  
That's my bad, I can't even blame her for that  
Enough to make me to…  
Momma please just get my bail  
I know nobody to blame  
Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself  
And we all just entertainers  
And we're stupid, and contagious  
And we all just entertainers  
And Baby  
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you  
I just can't crack the code  
One day you screaming you love me loud  
The next day you're so cold  
One day you here, one day you there, one day you care  
You're so unfair sipping from the cup  
Till it runneth over, Holy Grail  
Now I got tattoos on my body  
Psycho… in my lobby  
I got haters in the paper  
Photo shoots with paparazzi  
Can't even take my daughter for a walk  
See them by the corner store  
I feel like I'm cornered off  
Enough is enough  
I'm calling this off  
Who the fuck I'm kidding though?  
I'm getting…  
Sitting low  
Sliding by  
In that big body  
Curtains all in my window  
This fame hurt  
But this chain works  
I think back  
You asked the same person  
If this is all you had to deal with  
…deal with  
It, this… ain't work  
This light work  
Camera snapping, my eyes hurt  
…dying back where I was birthed  
…your iris and IRS  
Get the… up off of your high horse  
You got the… that…  
Dry yours  
Why you mad  
Take the good with the bad  
Don't throw that baby out with the bath water  
You're still alive  
Still that…  
You survived  
You still getting bigger…  
Living the life  
Vanilla wafers  
In a villa  
Illest… alive  
Michael Jackson thriller  
And Baby  
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you  
I just can't crack the code  
One day you screaming you love me loud  
The next day you're so cold  
One day you here, one day you there, one day you care  
You're so unfair sipping from the cup  
Till it runneth over, Holy Grail
