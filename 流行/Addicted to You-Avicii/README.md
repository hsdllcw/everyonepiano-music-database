### Addicted to You歌词：

I don't know just how it happened,  
I let down my guard...  
Swore I'd never fall in love again  
But I fell hard.  
Guess I should have seen it coming,  
Caught me by surprise...  
I wasn't looking where I was going,  
I fell into your eyes.  
You came into my crazy world like a cool and cleansing wave.  
Before I, I knew what hit me baby you were flowing through my veins...  
I'm addicted to you,  
Hooked on your love,  
Like a powerful drug  
I can't get enough of,  
Lost in your eyes,  
Drowning in blue  
Out of control,  
What can I do?  
I'm addicted to you!  
Midnight blows in through the window,  
Dances round the room...  
Got me hypnotized,  
I'm getting high on the perfume.  
I couldn't live without you now,  
Oh, I know I'd go insane,  
I wouldn't last one night alone baby,  
I couldn't stand the pain!  
I'm addicted to you!  
Hooked on your love,  
Like a powerful drug  
I can't get enough of,  
Lost in your eyes,  
Drowning in blue  
Out of control,  
What can I do?  
I'm addicted to you!
