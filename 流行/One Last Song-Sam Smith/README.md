### One Last Song歌词：

Maybe one day

I won't sing about you  
我不会再唱起你  
I'll sing a song about someone new  
我会唱着关于某个新欢的歌  
But right here, right now

You are on my mind

And I think about you all the time  
我还会一直想起你  
I'm sending a message to you  
我有些话要带给你  
And I'm hoping that it will get through  
希望那会让我早日恢复自己  
When it was good it was bittersweet honey  
从前是美好的也是苦乐参半的  
You made me sad 'til I loved the shade of blue  
你让我不住悲伤直到我爱上忧郁  
I know you don't want to talk to me  
我知道你于我无话可说  
So this is what I will do  
而这却是我要去做的  
Maybe you're listening

So here's one last song for you
