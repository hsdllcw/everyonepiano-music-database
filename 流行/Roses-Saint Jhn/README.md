### Roses歌词：

Roses  
I walked in the corner with the body screaming dolo  
Never sold a bag but look like pablo in a photo  
This gon' make 'em feel the way like Tony killed Manolo  
You already know though you already know though  
I walk in the corner with the money on my finger  
She might get it popping I might wife her for the winter  
I already know already know ni**a roses  
All I need is roses  
Turn up baby turn up when I turn it on  
You know how I get too lit when I turn it on  
Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on  
Too fast never ask if the life don't last  
Done been through it all  
F**k with a ni**a raw this who you wanna be  
And I know you won't tell nobody nothing  
And I know you won't tell nobody no  
Roses  
I might pull up flexing on these niggas like aerobics  
I might tell her girl you cute but balling  
That sh*t gorgeous  
Standing on the table Rosé Rosé f**k the waters  
You know who to the God is  
Turn up baby turn up when I turn it on  
You know how I get too lit when I turn it on  
Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on  
Too fast never ask if the life don't last  
Done been through it all  
F**k with a ni**a raw  
Who you wanna be  
I might bring them Brooklyn niggas out oh lord it's overs  
I might bring them strippers out and tell 'em do it pole less  
You already know already know ni**a roses  
Kill 'em make it  
Turn up baby turn up when I turn it on  
You know how I get too lit when I turn it on  
Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on  
Too fast never ask if the life don't last  
Done been through it all  
F**k with a ni**a raw this who you wanna be  
And I know you won't tell nobody nothing  
And I know you won't tell nobody no  
Roses  
Roses
