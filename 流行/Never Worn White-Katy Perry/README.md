### Never Worn White歌词：

You love the Hell out of me  
And Heaven's where we could be  
I've stood on the edge of love  
But never took the leap  
And you took my armor off  
And did it delicately  
And I let my guard down  
To show you what's underneath  
Thank God that you were man enough to come  
Answer my mamma's prayers  
You asked the question I said "Yes"  
But I'm scared  
'Cause I've never worn white  
But I wanna get it right  
Yeah I really wanna try with you  
No I've never worn white  
But I'm standin' here tonight  
'Cause I really wanna say "I do"  
I do  
See us in sixty years with a full family tree  
I do  
Give my blood sweat and tears to reach our destiny  
I do  
'Cause love is a minefield let's take this war baby  
I do  
'Cause at the end of it all I choose you and you choose me  
I do  
Thank God I was woman enough to come  
Answer your father's prayers  
You asked the question  
I could tell you were scared  
'Cause I've never worn white  
But I wanna get it right  
Yeah I really wanna try with you  
No I've never worn white  
But I'm standin' here tonight  
'Cause I really wanna say "I do"  
Now let's dance with each other  
Mixin' all of our colors  
It's so easy to surrender  
When you finally find forever  
No I've never worn white no  
But I really wanna try with you  
Yeah I've never worn white  
But I wanna get it right  
'Cause you really wanna say "I do"  
'Cause I do  
Oh I do yeah yeah  
I do
