### Lovers on the Sun歌词：

Let’s light it up, let’s light it up  
Until our hearts catch fire  
And so the world, a burning light  
They've never shined so bright  
We’ll find a way, we’ll find a way  
To keep the cold night  
From breaking in over the walls  
Into the wild side  
The hunger satisfies  
We're burning up  
We might as well be lovers on the sun  
We might as well be lovers on the sun  
We might as well be lovers on the sun  
We’ll never know, we’ll never know  
What stands behind the North  
But I got a feeling  
It’s a feeling that’s we’re dying for  
Just close your eyes, and hold your breath  
Because it feels right  
We’ll keep it moving till we make it to the other side  
And let’s enjoy the ride  
We're burning up  
We might as well be lovers on the sun  
We might as well be lovers on the sun  
We might as well be lovers on the sun  
Let’s light it up, let’s light it up  
Until our hearts catch fire  
And so the world, a burning light  
They've never shined so bright
