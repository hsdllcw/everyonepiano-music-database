### Die for You歌词：

I'm findin' ways to articulate  
The feeling I'm goin' through  
I just can't say I don't love you  
'Cause I love you, yeah  
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold  
But tonight I'm gon' let you know  
Let me tell the truth  
Baby let me tell the truth, yeah  
You know what I'm thinkin'  
See it in your eyes  
You hate that you want me  
Hate it when you cry  
You're scared to be lonely  
'Specially in the night  
I'm scared that I'll miss you  
Happens every time  
I don't want this feelin'  
I can't afford love  
I try to find reason to pull us apart  
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect  
And I know that you're worth it  
I can't walk away, oh!  
Even though we're going through it  
And it makes you feel alone  
Just know that I would die for you  
Baby I would die for you, yeah  
The distance and the time between us  
It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby  
I would die for you  
Baby I would die for you, yeah  
I'm finding ways to manipulate the feelin' you're goin' through  
But baby girl, I'm not blamin' you  
Just don't blame me too, yeah  
'Cause I can't take this pain forever  
And you won't find no one that's better  
'Cause I'm right for you, babe  
I think I'm right for you, babe  
You know what I'm thinkin'  
See it in your eyes  
You hate that you want me  
Hate it when you cry  
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect  
And I know that you're worth it  
I can't walk away, oh!  
Even though we're going through it  
And it makes you feel alone  
Just know that I would die for you  
Baby I would die for you, yeah  
The distance and the time between us  
It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby  
I would die for you  
Baby I would die for you, yeah  
I would die for you  
I would lie for you  
Keep it real with you  
I would kill for you, my baby  
I'm just sayin', yeah  
I would die for you  
I would lie for you  
Keep it real with you  
I would kill for you, my baby  
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na  
Even though we're going through it  
And it makes you feel alone  
Just know that I would die for you  
Baby I would die for you, yeah  
The distance and the time between us  
It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby  
I would die for you  
Baby I would die for you, yeah babe  
Die for you
