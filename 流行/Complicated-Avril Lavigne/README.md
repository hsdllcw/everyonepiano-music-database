**Complicated** 演唱者Avril Lavigne，是首正中爱情骗子要害的简洁歌曲；沾染了弦乐色彩的“I’mWith
You”反映了Avril较为温和的一面。《 _Complicated_ 》并不是特别描写某一个人。基本上它是一首关于生活、伪装的人们和人际关系的歌曲。

### Complicated歌词：

Uhhuh, life's like this  
Uh huh, uh huh, that’s the way it is  
'Cause life's like this  
Uh huh, uh huh that's the way it is  
Chill out whatcha yelling for?  
Lay back it’s all been done before  
And if you could only let it be  
You will see  
I like you the way you are  
When we're driving in your car  
And you're talking to me one on one but you’ve become  
Somebody else round everyone else  
Watching your back like you can’t relax  
You’re trying to be cool you look like a fool to me  
Tell me  
Why you have to go and make things so complicated?  
I see the way you’re acting like you’re somebody else gets me frustrated  
Life’s like this you  
You fall and you crawl and you break  
And you take what you get and you turn it into honestly  
you promise me I’m never gonna find you fake it  
No no no  
You come over unannounced  
Dressed up like you’re something else  
Where you are and where it’s at you see  
You’re making me, laugh out when you strike your pose  
Take off all your preppy clothes  
You know you’re not fooling anyone  
When you’ve become  
Somebody else round everyone else  
Watching your back, like you can’t relax  
Trying to be cool you look like a fool to me  
Tell me  
Why you have to go and make things so complicated?  
I see the way you’re acting like you’re somebody else gets me frustrated  
Life’s like this you  
You fall and you crawl and you break  
Andyou take what you get and you turn it into honestly  
you promise me I’m never gonna find you fake it  
No no no  
Chill out whatcha yelling for?  
Lay back, it’s all been done before  
And if you could only let it be  
You would see  
Somebody else round everyone else  
Watching your back, like you can’t relax  
You’re trying to be cool, you look like a fool to me  
Tell me  
Why you have to go and make things so complicated?  
I see the way you’re acting like you’re somebody else gets mefrustrated  
Life’s like this you  
You fall and you crawl and you break  
And you take what you get and you turn it into honestly  
you promise me I’m never gonna find you fake it  
No no  
Why you have to go and make things so complicated?  
I see the way you’re acting like you’re somebody else gets mefrustrated  
Life’s like this you  
You fall and you crawl and you break  
And you take what you get and you turn it into honestly  
you promise me I’m never gonna find you fake it  
No no no
