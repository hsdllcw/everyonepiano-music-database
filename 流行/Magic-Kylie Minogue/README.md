### Magic歌词：

I feel like anything could happen  
The stars look different tonight  
They're glowing all around me  
It's flowing through my body  
I can feel it, I can feel it  
Don't know if I'm awake or dreaming  
There must be something in the air  
The time is disappearing  
This moment's never leaving  
I can feel it, I can feel it  
You got me started and nothing on earth can stop it  
It's crazy, I'm falling  
I don't know what else to call it  
Boy, do you believe in magic?  
Do you, do you, do you  
Do you believe in magic?  
Dancing together  
Ain't nothing that could be better  
Tomorrow don't matter  
We'll make the night last forever  
So, do you believe in magic?  
Do you, do you, do you  
Do you believe in magic?  
Free falling, it's a new emotion  
I swear there's diamonds in your eyes  
Come hold me like you mean it  
Don't wanna keep this secret  
Can you feel it?  
My heart beating  
You make me wanna do these wild things  
Your touch is supernatural  
Oh, I can't fight this feeling  
I'm floating through the ceiling  
Can you feel it?  
I can feel it  
You got me started and nothing on earth can stop it  
It's crazy, I'm falling  
I don't know what else to call it  
Boy, do you believe in magic?  
Do you, do you, do you  
Do you believe in magic?  
Dancing together  
Ain't nothing that could be better  
Tomorrow don't matter  
We'll make the night last forever  
So, do you believe in magic?  
Do you, do you, do you  
Do you believe in magic?  
(Magic, magic, magic, magic)  
Do you believe in?  
Do you believe in?  
(Magic, magic, magic, magic)  
Do you believe in magic?  
You got me started and nothing on earth can stop it  
It's crazy, I'm falling  
I don't know what else to call it  
Boy, do you believe in magic?  
Do you, do you, do you  
Do you believe in magic?  
Dancing together  
Ain't nothing that could be better  
Tomorrow don't matter  
We'll make the night last forever  
So, do you believe in magic?  
Do you, do you, do you  
Do you believe in magic?
