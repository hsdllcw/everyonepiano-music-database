Can't Touch This（U Can't Touch This）_ 是来自MC Hammer专辑《Please Hammer Don''t Hurt
''Em》中的主打歌曲。这是一首为Rick James的“Super Freak”（超级瘾君子）的采样作伴奏的轻柔Rap歌曲，它既是MC
Hammer的代表作，又可看作是90年代初流行说唱乐的一种风格标志。

  
U can't touch this这首歌在1990年帮MC Hammer赚了3千万美元，1千2百万买了Fremont,
CA的豪宅，剩下的钱买了17辆豪华轿车和其他东西。当时还有他的玩具娃娃(Hammer Doll)和一档电视节目，向小孩子传授Hip-
Hop、RAP等音乐理念。但因为奢侈的生活，和不知道自己应该走POP还是RAP路线而中止合约，1996年宣布破产了。当年还摔伤了一条腿，好友tupac被谋杀。他对说唱的贡献是融入了牧师祷告、口头禅等元素，很注重音乐的流行旋律。同时也获奖无数，对美国说唱音乐的影响不小。如今和妻子与他的4个孩子住在有4间房间的Northern
California，是一名传教士、福音歌手。

### Can't Touch This（U Can't Touch This）歌词：

Can't touch this  
Can't touch this  
Can't touch this (oh-oh oh oh oh-oh-oh)  
Can't touch this (oh-oh oh oh oh-oh-oh)

My-my-my-my music hits me so hard makes me say oh my Lord  
Thank you for blessing me with a mind to rhyme and two hyped feet  
It feels good when you know you're down  
A superdope homeboy from the Oaktown  
And I'm known as such  
And this is a beat uh u can't touch

I told you homeboy u can't touch this  
Yeah that's how we're livin' and you know u can't touch this  
Look in my eyes man u can't touch this  
You know let me bust the funky lyrics u can't touch this  
Fresh new kicks and pants  
You got it like that now you know you wanna dance  
So move out of your seat  
And get a fly girl and catch this beat  
While it's rollin' hold on pump a little bit  
And let me know it's going on like that like that  
Cold on a mission so pull on back  
Let 'em know that you're too much  
And this is a beat uh u can't touch

Yo I told you u can't touch this  
Why you standing there man, u can't touch this  
Yo sound the bells school is in sucka u can't touch this

Give me a song or rhythm  
Making 'em sweat that's what I'm giving 'em  
Now they know when you talk about the Hammer  
You talk about a show that's hyped and tight  
Singers are sweatin' so pass them a mic  
Or a tape to learn what it's gonna take  
And now he's gonna burn  
The charts legit either work hard  
Or you might as well quit

That's word because you know  
U can't touch this (oh-oh oh oh-oh-oh)  
U can't touch this (oh-oh oh oh-oh-oh)  
Break it down  
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh oh)  
Stop Hammer time  
Go with the flow in a sin if you can't move to this  
Then you probably are dead  
So wave your hands in the air  
Bust throught the moves run your fingers through your hair  
This is it, for a winner  
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner  
Move slide your rump  
Just for a minute let's all do the bump  
Bump bump bump yeeeah

U can't touch this  
Look man, u can't touch this  
You'll probably get hyped boy  
'Cause you know you can't, u can't touch this  
Ring the bell school's back in...break it down  
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)  
Stop, Hammer time  
(Oh-oh oh oh oh-oh-oh)  
(Oh-oh oh oh oh-oh-oh)  
(Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh)  
(Oh-oh oh oh oh-oh-oh) u can't touch this  
(Oh-oh oh oh oh-oh-oh) u can't touch this  
(Oh-oh oh oh oh-oh-oh) u can't touch this  
(Oh-oh oh oh oh-oh-oh) break it down  
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)  
Stop Hammer time  
Every time you see me the Hammer's just so hype  
I'm dope on the floor and I'm magic on the mic  
Now why would I ever, stop doing this  
With others makin' records that just don't hit  
I toured around the world from London to the BAY  
It's Hammer go Hammer  
mc hammer yo hammer and the rest can go and play  
U can't touch this (oh-oh oh oh oh-oh-oh)  
U can't touch this (oh-oh oh oh oh-oh-oh)  
U can't touch this (oh-oh oh-oh-oh)  
Yeah u can't touch this  
I told you u can't touch this (oh-oh oh-oh-oh)  
Too hype can't touch this  
Yo, get me outta here u can't touch this  
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
