### Head & Heart歌词：

Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum  
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum  
Oh my God oh my God  
This feeling's just began  
I'm saying things I've never said  
Doing things I've never done  
Oh my God oh my God  
When I see you I shoot away  
But I'm frozen in motion  
And my head tells me to stop  
Tells me to stop  
Few things feelings I feel about us  
Try to fight it but it's never enough  
My heart is certain  
It's more than a crush  
'Cause I'm frozen in motion  
And my head tells me to stop  
But my heart goes  
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum  
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum  
'Cause my heart goes  
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum  
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum  
Oh my God oh my God  
Can't believe what I've become  
I'm thinking things I shouldn't think  
Singing songs I've never sung  
Oh my God oh my God  
When I see you I shoot away  
But I'm frozen in motion  
And my head tells me to stop  
Tells me to stop  
Few things feelings to feel about us  
Try to fight it but it's never enough  
'Cause my heart  
My heart is certain  
It's more than a crush  
'Cause I'm frozen in motion  
And my head tells me to stop  
But my heart goes  
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum  
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum  
'Cause my heart goes  
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum  
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum  
But my heart goes  
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum  
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum  
'Cause my heart goes  
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum  
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum  
Your head in my heart  
My head in my heart  
I just held them apart  
Just help me to run  
But I'm good  
'Cause my heart goes  
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum  
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum  
'Cause my heart goes  
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum  
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum  
Oh my God oh my God  
This feeling's just began  
I'm saying things I've never said  
Doing things I've never done  
Oh my God oh my God  
When I see you I shoot away  
But I'm frozen in motion  
And my head tells me to stop  
But my heart goes
