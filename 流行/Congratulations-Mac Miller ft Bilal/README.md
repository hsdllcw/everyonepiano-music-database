### Congratulations歌词：

Where are you  
Ohhhhh ohhh hehehe  
Ohhhhh  
The divine feminine an album by Mac Miller  
Ohhhhh ohhh  
The divine feminine hehehe  
Mac Miller：  
Am I supposed to okay  
Love  
Love love love love love sex  
Love love love love love love love sex  
This sun don't shine when I'm alone  
I lose my mind and I lose control  
I see your eyes look through my soul  
Don't be surprised this all I know  
I felt the highs and they felt like you  
See a love like mine is too good to be true  
And you too divine to just be mine  
You remind me of the color blue  
Girl I'm so in love with you yeah  
Girl I'm so in love with you  
Yeah  
Well baby  
You were everything I ever wanted  
Bought a wedding ring it s in my pocket  
Planned to ask the other day  
Knew you'd run away so I guess I just forgot it  
Remember when you went away to college  
I was on the phone we into talking  
Past present future all the gossip God damn  
Puppy love ain't what it was darling  
Feelings that we have are so alarming  
I can make you laugh I can break the glass  
If we made it last it'd be a bargain  
Mr. Charming that is my department  
You was there before the fancy cars and  
You was there when I was just a starving artist  
When the car was having trouble starting  
Now we got our own apartment same box for the mail  
Same hamper for the laundry the food in the fridge is stale  
And this morning you cooked the eggs with the kale  
I tried to hit it while you was getting dressed  
You said all you ever think about is sex  
I'm like oh well you know me so well  
And if this will make you lay I swear I won't tell  
And every time I call your phone you better pick up your cell  
I swear to God I'ma freak out if it go straight to voice mail  
Well I'm the jealous type  
But I swear that a what heaven's like  
When I'm in that p**sy it's a better life  
That's the only way I'm tryna end the night  
That's my only chance I better get it right  
Take your time my baby  
Cause I'm waiting for you for you  
And I'ma make your mind go crazy  
Cause I'm waiting right here for you for you  
Bilal：  
You get closer with me run away  
All I ever know is the color gray  
Your loveliness bring me sunshine  
I found an angel so divine  
Heaven probably not the same without you  
But now you're in my world  
In my world ahhhh ahh  
Ahhh ahhhh ahhh ahhh
