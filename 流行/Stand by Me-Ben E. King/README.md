**Stand by Me** 由Ben E. King发表于1961年。有lady gaga翻唱过，还有约翰•列侬翻唱过。这首歌其实是根据灵歌“Lord
Stand By Me”加以改编而重新创作的，获得了全美排行的第四名。1986年，由于电影“伴我同行（ _Stand by Me_
）”采用了他的这首旧作当作同名的主题歌，使得他再度的受到了注意 ，还因而夺下了英国排行的冠军。而根据BMI的统计，还是全美二十世纪最受欢迎百大歌曲的第四名。

### Stand by Me歌词：

When the night has come  
And the land is dark  
And the moon is the only light we'll see  
No I won't be afraid  
Oh, I won't be afraid  
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

So darling, darling  
Stand by me, oh stand by me  
Oh stand, stand by me  
Stand by me

If the sky that we look upon  
Should tumble and fall  
All the mountains should crumble to the sea  
I won't cry, I won't cry  
No, I won't shed a tear  
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

And darling, darling  
Stand by me, oh stand by me  
Oh stand now, stand by me  
Stand by me

So darling, darling  
Stand by me, oh stand by me  
Oh stand now, stand by me, stand by me  
Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me  
Oh stand by me, oh won't you stand now, stand  
Stand by me
