**Love Story** 出自美国女歌手Taylor
Swift的第二张录音室专辑《Fearless》。她将传统的乡村音乐与摇滚乐几近完美的结合。整首歌曲的乐风清新，非常适合调节心情的时候听。

《 _Love Story_ 》这首由班卓琴和吉他伴奏的中速抒情歌曲，讲述的是一个类似于罗密欧与朱丽叶般的爱情故事。其作灵感来源于Taylor
Swift感兴趣的一个男生，然而这个男生并不受欢迎。当Taylor
Swift再次想起这件事的时候，便有感而发写下这首歌曲，她把这件事在第二副歌前后部分的位置，并围绕这些歌词发展了整首歌。Taylor
Swift认为歌词中的一句“嫁给我吧，朱丽叶，我爱你”是每个女孩都幻想的结局，她希望自己在某一天能够拥有这样的结局，这也是Taylor
Swift为什么把这句歌词写入歌曲中的原因。

### Love Story歌词：

We were both young when I first saw you  
I close my eyes and the flashback starts  
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air  
See the lights see the party the ball gowns  
See you make your way through the crowd  
And say hello  
Little did I know  
That you were Romeo you were throwing pebbles  
And my daddy said  
Stay away from Juliet  
And I was crying on the staircase  
Begging you please don't go  
And I said  
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone  
I'll be waiting all that's left to do is run  
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess  
It's a love story baby just say yes  
So I sneak out to the garden to see you  
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew  
So close your eyes escape this town for a little while  
'Cause you were Romeo I was a scarlet letter  
And my daddy said  
Stay away from Juliet  
But you were everything to me  
I was begging you please don't go  
And I said Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone  
I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run  
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess  
It's a love story baby just say yes  
Romeo save me they're trying to tell me how to feel  
This love is difficult but it's real  
Don't be afraid we'll make it out of this mess  
It's a love story baby just say yes  
Oh oh  
I got tired of waiting  
Wondering if you were ever coming around  
My faith in you was fading  
When I met you on the outskirts of town  
And I said  
Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone  
I keep waiting for you but you never come  
Is this in my head I don't know what to think  
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said  
Marry me Juliet you'll never have to be alone  
I love you and that's all I really know  
I talked to your dad go pick out a white dress  
It's a love story baby just say yes  
Oh oh  
Oh oh  
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you
