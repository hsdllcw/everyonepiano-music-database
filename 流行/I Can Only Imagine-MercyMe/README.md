### I Can Only Imagine歌词：

I can only imagine what it will be like  
When I walk by Your side  
I can only imagine what my eyes will see  
When Your face is before me  
I can only imagine  
Yeah

Surrounded by Your glory  
What will my heart feel?  
Will I dance for You Jesus?  
Or in awe of You be still?

Will I stand in Your presence  
Or to my knees will I fall?  
Will I sing, Hallelujah?  
Will I be able to speak at all?  
I can only imagine  
I can only imagine

I can only imagine when that day comes  
And I find myself standing in the sun  
I can only imagine when all I will do  
Is forever, forever worship You  
I can only imagine, yeah  
I can only imagine

Surrounded by Your glory  
What will my heart feel?  
Will I dance for You Jesus?  
Or in awe of You be still?

Will I stand in Your presence  
Or to my knees will I fall?  
Will I sing, Hallelujah?  
Will I be able to speak at all?  
I can only imagine  
I can only imagine

Surrounded by Your glory  
What will my heart feel?  
Will I dance for You Jesus?  
Or in awe of You be still?

Will I stand in Your presence  
Or to my knees will I fall?  
Will I sing, Hallelujah?  
Will I be able to speak at all?  
I can only imagine, yeah  
I can only imagine

I can only imagine, yeah  
I can only imagine  
I can only imagine  
I can only imagine

I can only imagine  
When all I would do  
Is forever, forever worship You  
I can only imagine
