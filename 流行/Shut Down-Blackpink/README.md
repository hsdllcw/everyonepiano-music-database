### Shut Down歌词：

Blackpink in your area  
Blackpink in your area  
컴백이 아냐 떠난 적 없으니까  
고개들이 돌아 진정해 목 꺾일라  
분홍빛의 얼음 drip drip drip freeze 'em on sight  
Shut it down what what what what  
게임이 아냐 진 적이 없으니까  
짖어봐 네 목에 목줄은 내 거니까  
땅바닥에 닿은 pedal we go two zero five  
Shut it down uh uh uh uh  
초록 비를 내려 머리 위로 Don't trip baby  
겸손하게 그냥 앉아있어 Just sit baby  
Praying for my downfall many have tried baby  
Catch me when you hear my Lamborghini go vroom vroom vroom vroom  
When we pull up you know it's a shutdown  
간판 내리고 문 잠가 shut down  
Whip it whip it whip it whip it  
Whip it whip it whip it whip it  
It's black and it's pink once the sun down  
When we pull up you know it's a shutdown  
간판 내리고 문 잠가 shut down  
Whip it whip it whip it whip it  
Whip it whip it whip it whip it  
Keep watching me shut it down  
Nah  
You don't wanna be on my bad side that's right I'm slidin' through  
Bunch of wannabes that wanna be me me three if I was you  
Been around the world pearls on ya girl VVS's we invested uh  
Need a lesson see the necklace see these dresses  
We don't buy it we request it uh  
A rockstar a popstar but rowdier  
Say bye to the paparazzi get my good side I'll smile for ya  
Know it ain't fair to ya it's scarin' ya like what now  
Blackpink in your area the area been shut down It's a shutdown  
네 다음 답안지야 똑바로 봐 don't sleep baby  
뒤집어봐 이건 가격표야 ain't cheap baby  
Stay in your own lane 'cause I'm 'bout to swerve  
Catch me when you hear my Lamborghini go vroom vroom vroom vroom  
When we pull up you know it's a shutdown  
간판 내리고 문 잠가 shut down  
Whip it whip it whip it whip it  
Whip it whip it whip it whip it  
It's black and it's pink once the sun down  
When we pull up you know it's a shutdown  
간판 내리고 문 잠가 shut down  
Whip it whip it whip it whip it  
Whip it whip it whip it whip it  
Keep watching me shut it down  
Shut it down Blackpink in your area  
Shut it down woah woah woah woah  
Shut it down Blackpink in your area  
Keep talking we shut you down
