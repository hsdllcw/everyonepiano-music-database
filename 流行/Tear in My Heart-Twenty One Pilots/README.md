### Tear in My Heart歌词：

An-nyŏng-ha-se-yo

Sometimes you've got to bleed to know,  
That you're alive and have a soul,  
But it takes someone to come around to show you how.

She's the tear in my heart, I'm alive,  
She's the tear in my heart, I'm on fire,  
She's the tear in my heart, Take me higher,  
Than I've ever been.

The songs on the radio are ok,  
But my taste in music is your face,  
And it takes a song to come around to show you how.

She's the tear in my heart, I'm alive,  
She's the tear in my heart, I'm on fire,  
She's the tear in my heart, Take me higher,  
Than I've ever been.

Than I've ever been  
Than I've ever been  
Than I've ever been

You fell asleep in my car, I drove the whole time,  
But that's ok, I'll just avoid the holes so you sleep fine,  
I'm driving here I sit, cursing my government,  
For not using my taxes to fill holes with more cement.

You fell asleep in my car, I drove the whole time,  
But that's ok, I'll just avoid the holes so you sleep fine,  
I'm driving here I sit, cursing my government,  
For not using my taxes to fill holes with more cement.

Sometimes you've got to bleed to know,  
That you're alive and have a soul,  
But it takes someone to come around to show you how.

She's the tear in my heart, I'm alive,  
She's the tear in my heart, I'm on fire,  
She's the tear in my heart, Take me higher,  
Than I've ever been.

My heart is my armor,  
She's the tear in my heart, she's a carver,  
She's a butcher with a smile, cut me farther,  
Than I've ever been.

Than I've ever been  
Than I've ever been  
Than I've ever been

My heart is my armor,  
She's the tear in my heart, she's a carver,  
She's a butcher with a smile, cut me farther,  
Than I've ever been.
