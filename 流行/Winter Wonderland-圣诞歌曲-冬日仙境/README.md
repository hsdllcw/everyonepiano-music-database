著名圣诞歌曲《 _冬季仙境_ 》（ _Winter Wonderland_
）首发于1934年，从那以后又被反复翻唱。歌词描写的是圣诞节前后的情景：堆着雪人，想象他就是某某人的模样，不自觉地踏入了一个只有冬天才有的奇异景象……

### Winter Wonderland（冬日仙境）英文歌词：

sleigh bells ring, are you listening,

in the lane, snow is glistening

a beautiful sight, we're happy tonight,

walking in a winter wonderland.

gone away is the bluebird

here to stay is a new bird

he sings a love song, as we go along,

walking in a winter wonderland.

in the meadow we can build a snowman

then pretend that he is parson brown

he'll say: are you married?

we'll say: no man,

but you can do the job

when you're in town

later on, we'll conspire

as we dream by the fire

to face unafraid, the plans that we've made,

walking in a winter wonderland.

later on, we'll conspire

as we dream by the fire

to face unafraid, the plans that we've made,

walking in a winter wonderland.

in the meadow we can build a snowman,

and pretend that he's charlie brown

we'll have lots of fun with mister snowman

until all the other children knock him down.

when it snows, ain't it thrilling

though your nose gets a chilling

we'll frolic and play, the eskimo way,

walking in a winter wonderland.

walking in a winter wonderland
