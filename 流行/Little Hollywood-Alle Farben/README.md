### Little Hollywood歌词：

We're living in our own little Hollywood  
We're washed up stars  
Everything's gon' be good  
We got everything we need in our neighborhood  
No fancy cars  
And when we were 15  
Smoking in the bar  
Ever really know it's sure  
But I was falling apart  
Remember Jimmy's pick up  
From driving into dark  
Think about it now  
We didn't think at all  
Home  
We're living in our own little Hollywood  
We're washed up stars  
Everything's gon' be good  
We got everything we need in our neighborhood  
No fancy cars  
Everything's gon' be good  
I don't wanna know where's gonna go is crazy  
Living this life  
We're living in our own little Hollywood  
We're washed up stars  
Everything's gon' be good  
Remember get in busty  
Free D on the wall  
You left me we borrow you sleep  
With the hand stead of the Lord  
I wonder what you been up to  
Jimmy still the same  
The old tree in the back yard  
Is still get back our nips  
I'm hanging on to everyone and know that we did at the time  
I don't wanna know where's gonna go is crazy  
Living this life  
Uh  
We're living in our own little Hollywood  
We're washed up stars  
Everything's gon' be good  
We got everything we need in our neighborhood  
No fancy cars  
Everything's gon' be good  
I don't wanna know where's gonna go is crazy  
Living this life  
We're living in our own little Hollywood  
We're washed up stars  
Everything's gon' be good  
We're washed up stars  
Everything's gon' be good  
We're washed up stars  
Everything's gon' be good  
We're living in our own little Hollywood  
We're washed up stars  
Everything's gon' be good  
We got everything we need in our neighborhood  
No fancy cars  
Everything's gon' be good  
I don't wanna know where's gonna go is crazy  
Living this life  
We're living in our own little Hollywood  
We're washed up stars  
Everything's gon' be good
