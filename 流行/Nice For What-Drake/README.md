### Nice For What歌词：

I wonder who mothaf**king representin'in here tonight  
Hold on hold on  
I keep letting you back in  
How can I explain myself  
Care for me care for me  
You said you'd care for me  
There for me there for me  
Lil weezy Ana s**t  
Cry for me cry for me  
Murda on the beat  
Give to me give to me  
Why won't you live for me  
I keep letting you back in  
How can I explain myself  
Care for me care for me  
I know you care for me  
There for me there for me  
You said you'd die for me  
Everybody get your mothaf**kin'roll on  
I know shorty and she doesn't want no slow song  
Had it made last year life goes on  
Haven't let that thing loose girl in so long  
You been inside know you like to lay low  
I've been peepin'what you bringin'to the table  
Workin'hard girl everything paid for  
First last phone bill car note cable  
With your phone out gotta hit them angles  
With your phone out snappin'like you fabo  
And you showin'off but it's alright  
And you showin'off but it's alright  
It's a short life yuh  
Care for me care for me  
You said you'd care for me  
There for me there for me  
Said you'd be there for me  
Cry for me cry for me  
You said you'd die for me  
Give to me give to me  
Why won't you live for me  
That's a real one in your reflection  
Without a follow without a mention  
You really pipin'up on these ni**as  
You gotta be nice for what to these ni**as  
I understand you gotta hunnid bands  
You got it baby Benz  
You got some bad friends  
High school pics you was even bad then  
You ain't stressing off no lover in the past tense  
You already had them  
Work at 8 am finish around five  
Hoes talk down you don't see them outside  
They don't really be the same offline  
You know dark days you know hard times  
Doing overtime for the last month  
Saturday call the girls get em gassed up  
Gotta hit the club gotta make that a*s jump  
Gotta hit the club like you hit them muthaf**kin angles  
With your phone out snappin'like you fabo  
And you showin'off but it's alright  
And you showin'off but it's alright  
It's a short life yuh  
These hoes  
Your boy  
I may  
Watch the breakdown  
Care for me care for me  
You said you'd care for me  
There for me there for me  
Said you'd be there for me  
Cry for me cry for me  
You said you'd die for me  
Give to me give to me  
Why won't you live for me  
Gotta make that jump  
Gotta make that  
Gotta gotta make that  
Gotta make that jump  
Gotta make that  
Gotta gotta make that  
Gotta gotta gotta g g gotta  
G g gotta gotta  
Gotta g g gotta gotta  
Gotta make that jump jump  
Let's go  
Bend it over lift it up  
Bend it over lift it up  
Make that jump jump  
Bend it over lift it up

Bend it over over over over over  
Lift it up

Care for me care for me  
You said you'd care for me  
There for me there for me

Gotta hit the club like you hit them hit them angles  
It's a short life yuh  
Cry for me cry for me  
You said you'd die for me
