### Rolling In The Deep歌词：

There's a fire starting in my heart  
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark  
Finally I can see you crystal clear  
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare  
See how I'll leave with every piece of you  
Don't underestimate the things that I will do  
There's a fire starting in my heart  
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark  
The scars of your love remind me of us  
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all  
The scars of your love they leave me breathless  
I can't help feeling  
We could have had it all  
Rolling in the deep  
You had my heart inside of your hand  
And you played it to the beat rolling in the deep  
Baby I have no story to be told  
But I've heard one on you now I'm gonna make your head burn  
Think of me in the depths of your despair  
Make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared  
The scars of your love remind me of us  
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all  
The scars of your love they leave me breathless  
I can't help feeling  
We could have had it all  
Rolling in the deep  
You had my heart inside of your hand  
And you played it  
To the beat  
Could have had it all  
Rolling in the deep  
You had my heart inside of your hand  
But you played it with a beating  
Throw your soul through every open door  
Count your blessings to find what you look for  
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold  
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow  
We could have had it all  
We could have had it all yeah  
It all  
It all  
It all  
We could have had it all  
Rolling in the deep  
You had my heart inside of your hand  
And you played it to the beat  
We could have had it all  
Rolling in the deep  
You had my heart  
Inside of your hand  
But you played it  
You played it  
You played it  
You played it to the beat
