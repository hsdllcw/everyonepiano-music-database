### I Said Hi歌词：

I stand in the corner like a tired boxer  
One hand on my cheekbone one hand on the rope  
And all my veins pump blood into my throat  
So I can hit the note go do it all again  
Tell 'em all I said hi hi  
Tell 'em all I said hi hi  
And I lay half awake thinking what's it's gonna take  
For my moment to arrive so sick and paralyzed  
And I chew my gum on the left side of my mouth  
Wonder when I'll spit it out yeah I'm just getting started  
Tell 'em all I said hi hope you've been well  
You've been asleep while I've been in hell  
Tell 'em all I said hi have a nice day  
I'll be just fine don't worry 'bout me  
Tell 'em all I said hi hi  
Tell 'em all I said hi hi  
I stand in the corner like a tired boxer  
One hand on my cheekbone one hand on the rope  
And all my veins pump blood into my throat  
So I can hit the note go do it all again  
Tell 'em all I said hi hope you've been well  
You've been asleep while I've been in hell  
Tell 'em all I said hi have a nice day  
I'll be just fine don't worry 'bout me  
Tell 'em all I said hi hi  
Tell 'em all I said hi hi  
Lying on my side watching time fly by  
And I bet the whole world thought that I would give up today  
Lying on my side watching time fly by  
And I bet the whole world thought that I would give up today  
Lying on my side watching time fly by  
And I bet the whole world thought that I would give up today  
Lying on my side watching time fly by  
And I bet the whole world thought that I would give up  
Yeah I bet the whole world thought that I would give up  
Tell 'em all I said hi hope you've been well  
You've been asleep while I've been in hell  
Tell 'em all I said hi have a nice day  
I'll be just fine don't worry 'bout me  
Tell 'em all I said hi hi  
Tell 'em all I said hi
