### I Lost A Friend歌词：

I lost a friend  
Like keys in a sofa  
Like a wallet in the backseat  
Like ice in the summer heat  
I lost a friend  
Like sleep on a red-eye  
Like money on a bad bet  
Like time worrying about  
Every bad thing that hasn't happened yet  
I know I'll be alright but I'm not tonight  
I'll be lying awake counting all the mistakes I've made  
Replaying fights  
I know I'll be alright but I'm not tonight  
I lost a friend I lost a friend  
I lost my mind and nobody believes me  
Say I know that he don't need me  
'Cause he made a little too much money to be 20 and sad  
And I'll be fine without 'em  
But all I do is write about 'em  
How the hell did I lose a friend I never had  
Never had  
I'm on the mend  
Like I'm wearing a neck brace  
Like I'm sleeping in my own place  
Like I'm pulling all the stitches out of my own face  
I'm on the mend  
Like I'm icing a new sprain  
Like I'm walking on a new cane  
Like it's been a couple days  
Since I slipped and said something sorta like your name  
I know I'll be alright but I'm not tonight  
I'll be lying awake counting all the mistakes I've made  
Replaying fights  
I know I'll be alright but I'm not tonight  
I lost a friend I lost a friend  
I lost my mind and nobody believes me  
Say I know that he don't need me  
'Cause he made a little too much money to be 20 and sad  
And I'll be fine without 'em  
But all I do is write about 'em  
How the hell did I lose a friend I never had  
I'd apologize if I thought it might make a difference  
Or make you listen  
I'd apologise if it was black and white  
But life is different  
Just try to listen to me now  
I know I'll be alright but I'm not tonight  
I lost a friend I lost a friend  
I lost my mind and nobody believes me  
Say I know that he don't need me  
'Cause he made a little too much money to be 20 and sad  
And I'll be fine without 'em  
But all I do is write about 'em  
How the hell did I lose a friend I never had  
Never had
