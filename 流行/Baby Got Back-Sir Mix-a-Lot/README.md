Baby Got Back_ 是美国著名的说唱歌手Sir Mix-a-Lot的歌曲，且收录在其专辑《Mack Daddy》中。

  
曾拥有骄人的唱片销量的Sir Mix-A-Lot不仅是流行文化中最具讽刺意味的饶舌艺人之一，他同时也是Hip-
Hop音乐工业最成功的D.I.Y.艺人。他来自一个几乎没有Hip-
Hop的城市，他在那里创办自己的厂牌，制作并推销他自己的音乐，以令人振奋的舞曲节奏与厚重的贝司底线为电声Old School Hip-
Hop做出了相当的贡献。Sir Mix-A-Lot与Rubins的Def
American厂牌签约后投身主流，并在Rubins的鼓励下确定了自己所擅长的模仿/讽刺PIMP的视觉风格。特别是在他的单曲“Baby Got
Back”在MTV台播出之后，那些挑战政治、种族、性等敏感问题的歌词被Mix-A-
Lot以他特有的轻松幽默的方式说了出来，在当时造成了相当强烈的文化影响。此后，在自己一直钟情的说唱摇滚的催动下，Mix-A-Lot花费了多年时间Def
American公司对簿公堂才得以解约，并与Metal Church 、Mudhoney 、PUSA等摇滚乐团合作，并组建了乐队Subset。

### Baby Got Back歌词：

Oh my god  
Becky, look at her butt  
It is so big  
She looks like one of those rap guys girlfriends  
Who understands those rap guys  
They only talk to her because she looks like a total prostitute  
I mean her butt  
It's just so big  
I can't believe it's so round  
It's just out there  
I mean, it's gross  
Look, she's just so black  
I like big butts and I cannot lie  
You other brothers can't deny  
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist  
And a round thing in your face  
You get sprung  
Wanna pull up front  
Cuz you notice that butt was stuffed  
Deep in the jeans she's wearing  
I'm hooked and I can't stop staring  
Oh, baby I wanna get with ya  
And take your picture  
My homeboys tried to warn me  
But with that butt you got  
Makes me so horny  
Ooh, all of that smooth skin  
You say you wanna get in my benz  
Well use me use me cuz you aint that average groupy  
I've seen them dancin'  
The hell with romancin'  
She's sweat, wet, got it goin like a turbo vette  
I'm tired of magazines  
Saying flat butts are the thing  
Take the average black man and him that  
She gotta pack much back  
Fellas (yeah) Fellas (yeah)  
Has your girlfriend got the butt (hell yeah)  
Well shake it, shake it, shake it, shake shake it, that healthy butt  
Baby got back  
(LA face with Oakland booty)  
I like'em round and big  
And when I'm throwin a gig  
I just can't help myself  
I'm actin like an animal  
Now here's my scandal  
I wanna get you home  
And --, double up -- --  
I aint talkin bout playboy  
Cuz silicone parts were made for toys  
I wannem real thick and juicy  
So find that juicy double  
Mixalot's in trouble  
Beggin for a piece of that bubble  
So I'm lookin' at rock videos  
Watchin' these bimbos walkin like hoes  
You can have them bimbos  
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo  
A word to soul the thick sistas  
I wanna get with ya  
I won't cus or hit ya  
But I gotta be straight when I say I wanna --  
Til the break of dawn  
I got it goin on  
Alot of pimps won't like this song  
Cuz them punks lie to hit it and quit it  
But I'd rather stay and play  
Cuz I'm long and I'm strong  
And I'm down to get the friction on  
So ladies (yeah), Ladies (yeah)  
If you wanna role in my Mercedes (yeah)  
Then turn around  
Stick it out  
Even white boys got to shout  
Baby got back  
(LA face with the Oakland booty)  
Yeah baby  
When it comes to females  
Cosmo and got nothin to do with my selection  
36-24-36  
Only if she's 5'3"  
So your girlfriend rolls a honda  
Playin workout tapes by Fonda  
But Fonda ain't got motor in the back of her Honda  
My anaconda don't want none unless you've got buns hon  
You can do side bends or sit-ups, but please don't lose that butt  
Some brothers wanna play that hard role  
And tell you that the butt and gold  
So they toss it and leave it  
And I pull up quick to retrieve it  
So cosmo says you're fat  
Well I aint down with that  
Cuz your waste is small and your curves are kickin  
And I'm thinkin bout stickin  
To the beanpole dames in the magazines  
You aint it miss thing  
Give me a sista I can't resist her  
Red beans and rice didn't miss her  
Some knucklehead tried to dis  
Cuz his girls were on my list  
He had game but he chose to hit 'em  
And pulled up quick to get with 'em  
So ladies if the butt is round  
And you wanna triple X throw down  
Dial 1-900-mixalot and kick them nasty thoughts  
Baby got back
