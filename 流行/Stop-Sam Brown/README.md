### Stop!歌词：

All that I have is all that you've given me  
Did you ever worry that I'd come to depend on you  
I gave you all the love I had in me  
Now I find you've lied and I can't believe it's true

Wrapped in her arms I see you across the street  
And I can't help but wonder if she knows what's going on  
You talk of love but you don't know how it feels  
When you realise that you're not the only one

Oh you'd better stop before you tear me all apart  
You'd better stop before you go and break my heart  
Ooh you'd better stop

Time after time I've tried to walk away  
But it's not that easy when your soul is torn in two  
So I just resign myself to it every day  
Now all I can do is to leave it up to you

Oh you'd better stop before you tear me all apart  
You'd better stop before you go and break my heart  
Ooh you'd better stop

Stop if love me  
(you will remember)  
Now's the time to be sorry  
(that day forever)  
I won't believe that you'd walk out on me

Oh you'd better stop before you tear me all apart  
You'd better stop before you go and break my heart  
Ooh you'd better stop
