### Before He Cheats歌词：

Right now he's probably slow dancing with a bleached-blond tramp,  
and she's probably getting frisky...  
right now, he's probably buying her some fruity little drink cause she can't
shoot whiskey...  
Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool-stick, showing her how to
shoot a combo...  
And he don't know...  
That I dug my key into the side of his pretty little suped up 4 wheel drive,  
carved my name into his leather seat...  
I took a Louisville slugger to both head lights,  
slashed a hole in all 4 tires...  
And maybe next time he'll think before he cheats.  
Right now, she's probably up singing some  
white-trash version of Shania karoke..  
Right now, she's probably saying "I'm drunk"  
and he's a thinking that he's gonna lucky,  
Right now, he's probably dabbing 3 dollars worth of that bathroom Polo...  
And he don't know...  
That I dug my key into the side of his pretty little suped up 4 wheel drive,  
carved my name into his leather seat,  
I took a Louisville slugger to both head lights,  
slashed a hole in all 4 tires...  
And maybe next time he'll think before he cheats.  
I might saved a little trouble for the next girl,  
Cause the next time that he cheats...  
Oh, you know it won't be on me!

Ohh... not on me...  
Cause I dug my key into the side of his pretty little suped up 4 wheel drive,  
carved my name into his leather seat...  
I took a Louisville slugger to both head lights,  
slashed a hole in all 4 tires...  
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats.  
Ohh.. Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats...  
Ohh... before he cheats...
