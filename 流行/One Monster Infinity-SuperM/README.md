### One (Monster & Infinity)歌词：

You hear me walk into your town right sounds right  
Feel that rumble in the ground right don't lie  
I'm the one better run if you wit' it oh  
Then you're done done done  
Dark cloud blocking out the sun  
I ain't scared got me feeling kind of numb  
Yeah it's a problem I know  
Tell me somethin' I don't know  
What you got I got more  
Keep it coming with that reload  
Ain't no stopping me though I go  
And I lose control  
고갤 들어  
Hear it talking to me  
In my body from the shadow waking up  
Bring the battle gimme what I want alright  
No games watch me deliver every time  
Catch me in the latest driving spaceships  
One way we going up ain't no decline  
Landing in the matrix tryna break it  
Hands up 나를 느껴봐 yeah  
All the way to infinity yeah  
높게 we going up there's no decline  
So if you're aiming anywhere aim high  
날려 make 'em drop yeah one  
Not enough level up  
You wanna see how I get down like yeah right  
우리 움직임은 거대한 그 하나  
Break you with that left with that right  
Make you feel the fire  
You ain't got the moves or the fuel  
That's the bottom line  
Think you're ready for the monster monster  
No turning back if you wanna face me no  
Tried to warn ya we was coming in  
Got no time for all this arguin' oh no  
It's way beyond control  
고갤 들어  
Hear it talking to me  
In my body from the shadow waking up  
Bring the battle gimme what I want alright  
No games watch me deliver every time  
Catch me in the latest driving spaceships  
One way we going up ain't no decline  
Landing in the matrix tryna break it  
Hands up 나를 느껴봐 yeah  
All the way to infinity yeah  
높게 we going up there's no decline  
So if you're aiming anywhere aim high  
너와 내가 하나 된 세상에  
I'll never stop  
No I'm not playing no games  
Face to face and don't run away  
Think you're ready for the monster monster  
Never seen a mountain too big for me  
I'm gon be alright  
Got forever on my mind  
No pressure but we pressin'  
So you better run  
We bring another dawn  
We've only just begun  
No games watch me deliver every time  
Catch me in the latest driving spaceships  
One way we going up ain't no decline  
Landing in the matrix tryna break it  
Hands up 나를 느껴봐 yeah  
All the way to infinity yeah  
높게 we going up there's no decline  
So if you're aiming anywhere aim high  
I'm the other one chillin with them other ones  
Other one  
I'm the other one chillin with them other ones  
Yeah other ones
