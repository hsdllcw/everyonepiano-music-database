**In Your Eyes双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_In Your Eyes_ 是加拿大创作型歌手The Weeknd的歌曲。收录在其2020年专辑After
Hours中。这种节奏，这种嗓音，都隐隐令人沉醉，心向往之。The
Weeknd的音乐与众不同，他的音乐作品大多节奏舒缓，却又是激情暗涌的，能紧紧抓住听众的心。他通过运用沉闷的低音和大量的Lo-
Fi回声营造出黑暗氛围，再加上他与迈克尔•杰克逊相似的唱腔让听众对他的音乐欲罢不能。

### In Your Eyes歌词：

Oh yeah  
I just pretend that I'm in the dark  
I don't regret 'cause my heart can't take a loss  
I'd rather be so oblivious  
I'd rather be with you  
When it's said when it's done yeah  
I don't ever wanna know  
I can tell what you done yeah  
When I look at you  
In your eyes  
I see there's something burning inside you  
Oh inside you  
In your eyes  
I know it hurts to smile but you try to  
Oh you try to  
You always try to hide the pain  
You always know just what to say  
I always look the other way  
I'm blind I'm blind  
In your eyes  
You lie but I don't let it define you  
Oh define you  
I tried to find love  
In someone else too many times  
But I hope you know I mean it  
Mean it  
When I tell you you're the one that was on my mind oh  
When it's said when it's done yeah  
I would never let you know  
Let you know  
I'm ashamed of what I've done yeah  
When I look at you  
In your eyes  
Your eyes  
I see there's something burning inside you  
Inside you  
Oh inside you  
Oh inside you  
In your eyes  
I know it hurts to smile but you try to  
But you try to  
Oh you try to  
You try to  
You always try to hide the pain  
Oh oh  
You always know just what to say  
Oh dear  
I always look the other way  
I'm blind I'm blind  
In your eyes  
You lie but I don't let it define you  
Hey  
Oh define you  
In your eyes  
I see there's something burning inside you  
Oh inside you  
You always try to hide the pain  
You always know just what to say  
I always look the other way  
I'm blind I'm blind  
In your eyes  
You lie but I don't let it define you  
Oh define you
