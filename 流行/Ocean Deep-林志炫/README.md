### Ocean Deep歌词：

Love can't you see I'm alone  
Can't you give this fool a chance  
A little love is all I ask  
A little kindness in the night  
Please don't leave me behind  
No don't tell me love is blind  
A little love is all I ask and that is all  
Oh love I've been searching so long  
I've been searching high and low  
A little love is all I ask  
A little sadness when you're gone  
Maybe you need a friend  
Only please don't let's pretend  
A little love is all I ask and that is all  
I wanna spread my wings  
But I just can't fly  
As string of pearl and pretty girls  
Go sailing by  
Ocean deep  
I'm so afraid to show my feelings  
I have sailed a million ceilings  
Solitary room  
Ocean deep  
Will I ever find a lover  
Maybe she has found another  
And as I cry myself to sleep I'll keep  
Ocean Deep  
I'm so afraid to show my feelings  
（You're the only one I love）  
I have sailed a million ceilings  
（Just can't reveal it）  
Solitary room  
Ocean deep  
（maybe maybe）  
Will I ever find a lover  
（Maybe she has found another）  
Maybe she has found another  
（Another）  
And as I cry myself to sleep I'll keep  
Ocean Deep
