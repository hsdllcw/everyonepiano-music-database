**Used to Love双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Used to Love_ 是Martin Garrix与Dean Lewis一同合作的单曲。节奏感超强的电子乐加上澳大利亚知名唱作人Dean
Lewis极具辨识度的微沙嗓音，融合起来简直完美。相对于如此欢快的节奏下，而歌词的表现力却是恰恰相反的：一个感情失意而落寞人无比困惑的内心写照
“我永远无法将你舍弃” “可我们回不到过去了” 。

### Used to Love歌词：

Walking through the door of this old and lonely  
Place that used to feel like us  
Remembering the only thing that made me  
Feel like I was worth the love  
We used to hold hands now I dance alone  
We had Springsteen playing so loud  
We danced in the dark till it felt like home  
With you home was anywhere  
But you will never be left behind  
Give me a moment I need just a little more time  
If I could I would have made things right  
But we can't go back to the way that we used to love  
Never apart you're still running through my blood  
But we can't go back to the way that we used to love  
But we can't go back to the way that we used to love  
We can't go back to the way that we used to  
Be talking through the night you laying by my side  
You were always there to heal my scars  
And into the dawn I do my best to try and find  
Some sleep but you still keep me up  
We used to hold hands now I dance alone  
We had Springsteen playing so loud  
We danced in the dark till it felt like home  
With you home was anywhere  
But you will never be left behind  
Give me a moment I need just a little more time  
If I could I would have made things right  
But we can't go back to the way that we used to love  
Never apart you're still running through my blood  
But we can't go back to the way that we used to love  
We can't go back to the way that we used to  
But I can't escape you're still in my head  
I'm running from I'm running from the emptiness  
But I can't escape you're still in my head  
I'm running from I'm running from the emptiness  
But I can't escape you're still in my head  
I'm running from I'm running from the emptiness  
But I can't escape you're still in my head  
I'm running from I'm running from the emptiness  
We can't go back to the way that we used to love
