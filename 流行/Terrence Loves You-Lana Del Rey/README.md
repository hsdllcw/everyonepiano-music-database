**Terrence Loves You** 是Lana Del Rey的歌曲，收录在其专辑《Honeymoon》中。Lana Del
Rey本名Elizabeth Grant，1986年6月21日出生于美国纽约州，美国女歌手、词曲创作者、模特。

《Honeymoon》的出现，正像她及时而至的成熟宣言。整张专辑中的14首歌曲，犹如组成的一部爱情长诗，其中的内容就好像一个痴恋女子说服爱人，一同逃离现状去度“蜜月”的故事。Lana
Del Rey标志性的低音复古唱腔：慵懒、空灵、凄迷、哀艳、幽怨、怅惘的气息愈发令人着迷。这一切都让人欣喜，这一次，Lana Del
Rey向乐迷展现的是一个更本色的“自我”形象。第3首《 _Terrence Loves You_ 》说的是她失去爱人时的迷惘痛苦。

### Terrence Loves You歌词：

You are what you are  
I don't matter to anyone  
But Hollywood legends will never grow old  
And all of what's hidden  
Well, it will never grow cold

But I lost myself when I lost you  
But I still got jazz when I've got those blues  
And I lost myself when I lost you  
And I still get trashed, darling, when I hear your tunes

But you are who you are  
I won't change you for anything  
For when you are crazy  
I'll let you be bad  
I'll never dare change thee to what you are not

But I lost myself when I lost you  
But I still got jazz when I've got those blues  
I lost myself and I lost you too  
And I still get trashed, baby, when I hear your tunes

I put the radio on, hold you tight in my mind  
Isn't strange that you're not here with me  
But I know the light's on in the television  
Trying to transmit, can you hear me?  
Ground control to Major Tom  
Can you hear me all night long?  
Ground control to Major Tom

Well I lost myself when I lost you  
But I still got jazz when I've got the blues  
I lost myself and I lost you too  
And I still get trashed, honey, when I hear your tunes
