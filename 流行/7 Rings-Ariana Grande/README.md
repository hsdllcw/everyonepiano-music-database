### 7 Rings歌词：

Yeah breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles  
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble  
Lashes and diamonds ATM machines  
Bought myself all of my favorite things  
Yeah  
Been through some bad s**t I should be a sad b***h  
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage  
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings  
Write my own checks like I write what I sing yeah  
Yeah  
My wrist stop watchin' my neck is flossy  
Make big deposits my gloss is poppin'  
You like my hair  
Gee thanks just bought it  
I see it I like it I want it I got it  
Yeah  
I want it I got it I want it I got it  
I want it I got it I want it I got it  
You like my hair  
Gee thanks just bought it  
I see it I like it I want it I got it  
Yeah  
Wearing a ring but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."  
Bought matching diamonds for six of my b***hes  
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches  
Think retail therapy my new addiction  
Whoever said money can't solve your problems  
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em  
They say "Which one" I say "Nah I want all of 'em"  
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms  
My smile is beamin' my skin is gleamin'  
The way it shine I know you've seen it  
You've seen it  
I bought a crib just for the closet  
Both his and hers I want it I got it yeah  
I want it I got it I want it I got it  
I want it I got it I want it I got it  
Baby  
You like my hair  
Gee thanks just bought it  
Oh yeah  
I see it I like it I want it I got it  
Yeah  
I got my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers  
If it ain't money then wrong number  
Black card is my business card  
The way it be settin' the tone for me  
I don't mean to brag but I be like "Put it in the bag" yeah  
When you see them racks they stacked up like my a*s yeah  
Shoot go from the store to the booth  
Make it all back in one loop gimme the loot  
Never mind I got the juice  
Nothing but net when we shoot  
Look at my neck look at my jet  
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect  
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set  
If I like it then that's what I get yeah  
I want it I got it I want it I got it  
Yeah  
I want it I got it I want it I got it  
Oh yeah yeah  
You like my hair  
Gee thanks just bought it  
I see it I like it I want it I got it  
Yeah
