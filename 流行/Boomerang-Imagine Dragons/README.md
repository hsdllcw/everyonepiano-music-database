**Boomerang双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Boomerang_ 此曲出自美国独立摇滚乐队Imagine Dragons的第四张录音室专辑Origins。Imagine
Dragons音乐中最迷人的特质就是融合了电子乐和摇滚乐的时尚曲风，主唱丹•雷诺斯来去自如的真假音穿梭，让人时而坠入云端、时而潜入深海的如冒险般体验的旋律。也因为乐队歌曲中的大片即视感，让其接连成为好莱坞电影的插曲、主题曲坐镇者。

### Boomerang歌词：

How many lies do we have to tell  
To keep on saying that I wish you well  
How many times said I'm movin' on  
How many times that false alarm goes on  
Goes on  
Goes on  
Goes on  
I know I'll see you tomorrow  
'Cause I'm bad at lettin' you go lettin' you go  
Lettin' you go lettin' you go  
Moving on moving on moving on moving on  
I'm ready to go ready to go  
I'm ready to throw ready to throw  
You're my boomerang-boomerang  
You're my boomerang-boomerang  
How many tears do we have to cry  
How many sleepless lonely nights  
To work it up is it worth enough  
Should we go ahead  
Or should we turn around  
I know I'll see you tomorrow  
'Cause I'm bad at lettin' you go lettin' you go  
Lettin' you go lettin' you go  
Moving on moving on moving on moving on  
I'm ready to go ready to go  
I'm ready to throw ready to throw  
You're my boomerang-boomerang  
You're my boomerang-boomerang  
Just because it isn't easy doesn't mean that it is wrong  
Everything that we've been working on working on so long  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
You're my boomerang-boomerang  
Ooh  
You're my boomerang-boomerang  
You're my boomerang-boomerang  
You're my Boome-Boome-rang-rang  
Lettin' you go lettin' you go  
Boome-rang-rang  
Lettin' you go lettin' you go  
Boome-rang-rang  
Moving on moving on  
Boome-rang-rang  
Moving on moving on  
Boome-rang-rang  
Ready to go ready to go  
Boome-rang-rang  
Ready to throw ready to throw  
You're my boomerang-boomerang  
You're my boomerang-boomerang  
Lettin' you go lettin' you go  
Boome-rang-rang  
Lettin' you go lettin' you go  
Boome-rang-rang  
Moving on moving on  
Boome-rang-rang  
Moving on moving on  
Boome-rang-rang  
Ready to go ready to go  
Boome-rang-rang  
Ready to throw ready to throw  
You're my boomerang-boomerang  
You're my boomerang-boomerang
