### Rise Up歌词：

I was hoping for an indication  
I was seeking higher elevation  
Ay ay ay ay ay ay  
I've been shaken wakin' in the night light  
I've been breaking hiding from the spotlight  
Ay ay ay ay ay ay  
The more I stray the less I fear  
And the more I reach the more I fade away  
The darkness right in front of me  
Oh it's calling out and I won't walk away  
I would always open up the door  
Always looking up at higher floors  
Want to see it all give me more  
Rise rise up  
I was always up for making changes  
Walking down the streets meeting strangers  
Flipping through my life turning pages  
Rise rise up  
Like a prayer that only needs a reason  
Like a hunter waiting for the season  
Ay ay ay ay ay ay  
I was there but I was always leaving  
I was living but I was never breathing  
Ay ay ay ay ay ay  
The more I stray the less I fear  
And the more I reach the more I fade away  
The darkness right in front of me  
Oh it's calling out and I won't walk away  
I would always open up the door  
Always looking up at higher floors  
Want to see it all give me more  
Rise rise up  
I was always up for making changes  
Walking down the streets meeting strangers  
Flipping through my life turning pages  
Rise rise up  
I'm bursting like the fourth of July so color me and blow me away  
I'm broken in the prime of my life  
So embrace it and leave me to stray  
I would always open up the door  
Always looking up at higher floors  
Want to see it all give me more  
Rise rise up  
I was always up for making changes  
Walking down the streets meeting strangers  
Flipping through my life turning pages  
Rise rise up  
I would always open up the door  
Always looking up at higher floors  
Want to see it all give me more  
Rise rise up  
I was always up for making changes  
Walking down the streets meeting strangers  
Flipping through my life turning pages  
Rise rise up
