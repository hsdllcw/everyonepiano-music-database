### My Foolish Heart歌词：

The scene is set for dreaming  
Love's knocking at the door  
But oh my heart, I'm reluctant to start  
For we've been fooled before  
The night is like a lovely tune  
Beware, my foolish heart  
How white the ever constant moon  
Take care, my foolish heart  
There's a line between love and fascination  
That's hard to see on an evening such as this  
For they both give the very same sensation  
When you are lost in the magic of a kiss  
Her lips are much too close to mine  
Beware, my foolish heart  
But should our eager lips combine  
Then let the fire start  
For this time, it isn't fascination  
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart  
It's love, this time it's love, my foolish heart  
For this time, it isn't fascination  
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart  
It's love, this time it's love, my foolish heart
