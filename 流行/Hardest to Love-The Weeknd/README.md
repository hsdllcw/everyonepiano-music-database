### Hardest to Love歌词：

No yeah  
Oh yeah  
Oh yeah  
Yeah uh  
You try with me so many times yeah  
You're cryin' out behind the smiles  
And I can see right through the lies  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
And what we had is dead inside yeah  
You're actin' like it's still alive ayy  
And you still wanna make it right yeah  
I know  
But I've been the hardest to love  
You're tryna let me go yeah  
And I can see it I can see it  
I've been the hardest to love  
It's hard to let me go yeah  
And I can feel it I can feel it  
Oh yeah  
I don't feel it anymore  
Yeah  
The house I bought is not a home  
No  
Together we are so alone  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Oh  
Don't regret the day we met  
We met  
Don't forget that time we spent  
We spent  
Forget that we're in different beds  
I know  
'Cause I've been the hardest to love  
You're tryna let me go yeah  
And I can see it I can see it  
I've been the hardest to love  
It's hard to let me go yeah  
And I can feel it I can feel it  
I can't can't believe you want me  
After all the heart breaks after all I've done oh-oh-oh  
Oh oh oh  
No I can't can't believe you trust me  
Trust me  
After all the rough days you still call me up  
Me up oh-oh-oh  
'Cause I've been the hardest to love  
You're tryna let me go  
Tryna let me go  
Yeah  
And I can see it I can see it  
I can see it  
I've been the hardest to love  
Love baby  
You're tryna let me go yeah  
And I can feel it I can feel it
