### Ain't Nobody歌词：

Captured effortlessly  
That's the way it was  
Happened so naturally  
I did not know it was love  
The next thing I felt was  
You holding me close  
What was I gonna do?  
I let myself go

And now we're flyin' through the stars  
I hope this night will last forever

Ain't nobody  
Loves me better  
Makes me happy  
Makes me feel this way  
Ain't nobody  
Loves me better than you

I've been waitin' for you  
It's been so long  
I knew just what I would do  
When I heard your song  
You filled my heart with a kiss  
Ya gave me freedom  
You knew I could not resist  
I needed someone

Ain't nobody  
Loves me better  
Makes me happy  
Makes me feel this way  
Ain't nobody  
Loves me better than you

I make my wish upon a star  
And hope this night will last forever  
I make my wish upon a star  
And hope this night will last forever

Ain't nobody  
Loves me better  
Makes me happy  
Makes me feel this way  
Ain't nobody  
Loves me better than you

At first you put your arms around me  
Then you put your charms around me  
We stare into each other's eyes  
And what we see is no surprise  
Got a feeling most would treasure  
And a love so deep we cannot measure

Ain't nobody  
Loves me better  
Makes me happy  
Makes me feel this way  
Ain't nobody  
Loves me better than you
