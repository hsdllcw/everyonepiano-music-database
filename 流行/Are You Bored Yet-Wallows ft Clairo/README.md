### Are You Bored Yet歌词：

What's wrong you've been askin'  
But I don't have an answer  
How come I'm still thinkin'  
Let's pretend to fall asleep now  
When we get old will we regret this  
Too young to think about all that s**t  
And stalling only goes so far  
When you've got a head start  
'Cause we could stay at home and watch the sunset  
But I can't help from asking are you bored yet  
And if you're feelin' lonely you should tell me  
Before this ends up as another memory  
Will you tell the truth so I don't have to lie  
Will you tell the truth so I don't have to lie  
Feels like I've known you my whole life  
I can see right through your lies  
I don't know where we're goin'  
But I'd like to be by your side  
If you could tell me how you're feelin'  
Maybe we could get through this undefeated  
Holdin' on for so long oh  
'Cause we could stay at home and watch the sunset  
But I can't help from asking are you bored yet  
And if you're feelin' lonely you should tell me  
Before this ends up as another memory  
Will you tell the truth so I don't have to lie  
Will you tell the truth so I don't have to lie
