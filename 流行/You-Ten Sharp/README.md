### You歌词：

It's all right with me  
as long as you  
are by my side  
Talk or just say nothing  
I don't mind your looks never lie  
I was always on the run  
finding out what I was looking for  
And I was always insecure  
just until I found  
Words often don't come easy  
I never learned  
to show you the inside of me  
I know my baby  
You were always patient  
dragging out what I try to hide  
I was always on the run  
finding out what I was looking for  
and I was always insecure  
until I found  
You, you were always on my mind  
you, you're the one I've been living for  
you, you're my everlasting fire  
you're my always shining star  
The night's always a good friend  
a glass of wine, and the lights are low  
you lying beside me, me full of love  
and filled with hope....
