### Tee Shirt歌词：

In the morning  
when you wake up  
I like to believe you are  
thinking of me  
And when the sun comes  
through your window I  
like to believe you’ve been  
dreaming of me  
Dreaming mmm mmm  
I know  
'cause I've spent  
half this morning  
thinking about the t-shirt you sleep in  
I should know  
'cause I've spent  
all the whole day  
listening your message I’m keeping

and never deleting

When I saw you,  
everyone knew I  
liked the effect that you  
had on my eyes  
when no one else heard  
the weight of your words or  
felt the effect that they  
had on my mind  
Falling mmm mmm  
I know  
'cause I've spent  
half this morning  
thinking about the t-shirt you sleep in  
I should know  
'cause I've spent  
all the whole day  
listening to your message I’m keeping  
And never deleting
