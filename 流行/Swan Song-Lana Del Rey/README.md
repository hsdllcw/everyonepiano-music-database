**Swan Song双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Swan Song_ 是Lana Del Rey演唱歌曲，收录于专辑《Honeymoon》，专辑于2015年9月18日发行。Lana Del
Rey之所以会为专辑取这个标题的原因，是因为她本人认为“Honeymoon”这个词代表了终极梦想的总和，蜜月就是生命、爱情、天堂、自由等等，它们都是永恒的。此外，Lana
Del
Rey也对自己这张专辑的音乐艺术风格定位明晰，表示专辑听起来会与她上一张录音室专辑《Ultraviolence》完全不同，专辑的音乐风格会比较接近于她的首张录音室专辑《Born
to Die》，这也是她个人比较喜欢的一种音乐类型。

### Swan Song歌词：

Put your white tennis shoes on and follow me  
Why work so hard when you could just be free?  
You got your moment now, you got your legacy  
Let's leave the world for the ones who change everything  
Nothing could stop the two of us  
Let's just get lost, that's what we want

And I will never sing again  
And you won't work another day  
I will never sing again  
With just one wave it goes away  
It will be our swan song  
It will be our swan song  
Be our swan song  
It will be our swan song

Dive in, dive deep in dark blue my sweet  
Rushing up from the water where the ice meets  
And you've been gone so long, you missed everything  
The world can change in a day if you go away  
But nothing could stop the two of us  
If that's what we want  
We could just get lost

And I will never sing again  
And you won't work another day  
I will never sing again  
With just one wave it goes away  
It will be our swan song  
It will be our swan song  
Be our swan song  
It will be our swan song

Do you like  
Do you like where you've been and  
Where you're going to (going to)  
Say goodnight  
Say goodnight to the life and the world you knew  
I'm going to follow you

And I will never sing again  
And you won't work another day  
And I will never sing again  
You won't work another day  
It will be our swan song  
It will be our swan song  
Be our swan song  
It will be our swan song

Put your white tennis shoes on and follow me  
Put your white tennis shoes on and follow me  
Put your white tennis shoes on and follow me  
Why you work so hard when you could just be free
