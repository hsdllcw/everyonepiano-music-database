**Physical双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Physical_ 是阿尔巴尼亚裔英国歌手Dua
Lipa的歌曲。此曲延续着前两首先行曲的复古Disco舞曲风格。前奏低沉闷响的鼓点急促滚动，金属刮擦般的电子音效带来一种暗夜降临的冷冽质感。全曲以强劲有力的重节拍为主，与动感欢快的弦乐编曲渲染出躁动火热的音乐氛围。Dua
Lipa偏中性的嗓音与如此节奏跳脱的曲风相配再合适不过，平稳递进的中音到副歌部分爬升为充满力量感的高音，诚邀我们加入她的派对，连空气都突然之间炽热沸腾，让人欲罢不能地沉沦。当这首歌在耳机里炸裂开时，体内仿佛燃烧起了熊熊火焰，恍然间已然混迹于上世纪80年代的迪斯科舞厅，忍不住跟随着热烈的旋律和舞动的人群一起动感摇摆，彻夜狂欢。

### Physical歌词：

Common love isn't for us  
We created something phenomenal  
Don't you agree  
Don't you agree  
You got me feeling diamond rich  
Nothing on this planet compares to it  
Don't you agree  
Don't you agree  
Who needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me  
All night I'll riot with you  
I know you got my back and you know I got you  
So come on  
Come on  
Come on  
Come on  
Come on  
Come on  
Let's get physical  
Lights out follow the noise  
Baby keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice  
So come on  
Come on  
Come on  
Come on  
Come on  
Let's get physical  
Adrenaline keeps on rushing in  
Love the simulation we're dreaming in  
Don't you agree  
Don't you agree  
I don't wanna live another life  
'Cause this one's pretty nice  
Living it up  
Who needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me  
All night I'll riot with you  
I know you got my back and you know I got you  
So come on  
Come on  
Come on  
Come on  
Come on  
Come on  
Let's get physical  
Lights out follow the noise  
Baby keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice  
So come on  
Come on  
Come on  
Come on  
Come on  
Let's get physical  
Hold on just a little tighter  
Come on hold on tell me if you're ready  
Come on  
Come on come on  
Baby keep on dancing  
Let's get physical  
Hold on just a little tighter  
Come on hold on tell me if you're ready  
Come on  
Come on come on  
Baby keep on dancing  
Let's get physical  
All night I'll riot with you  
I know you got my back and you know I got you  
So come on come on come on  
Let's get physical  
Lights out follow the noise  
Baby keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice  
So come on  
Come on  
Come on  
Come on  
Come on  
Let's get physical  
Physical physical  
Let's get physical  
Physical physical  
Physical  
Physical physical  
Let's get physical  
Physical physical  
Come on phy-phy-phy-physical
