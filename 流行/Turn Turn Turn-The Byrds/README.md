**Turn! Turn! Turn!** 是美国60年代的一支乐队The Byrds所演唱的歌曲。乐队共由五人组成，都热爱民谣。

The Byrds是摇滚史上最被低估的乐队之一。对于The Byrds来说 " _Turn! Turn! Turn! (To Everything
There is A Season)_ "是如此的重要 --他们是首次将旋律同强节奏，充满热情的歌词的英式入侵民谣融合起来的乐队。The Byrds
毫不费力的像一件带有羽毛的Lear飞机一般，穿梭在Bob Dylan的冥想，内心的奇特幻觉和整个美国音乐影响范围中，让乡村音乐拥有了更多的听众。

### Turn! Turn! Turn!歌词：

To everything - turn, turn, turn  
There is a season - turn, turn, turn  
And a time to every purpose under heaven

A time to be born, a time to die  
A time to plant, a time to reap  
A time to kill, a time to heal  
A time to laugh, a time to weep

To everything - turn, turn, turn  
There is a season - turn, turn, turn  
And a time to every purpose under heaven

A time to build up, a time to break down  
A time to dance, a time to mourn  
A time to cast away stones  
A time to gather stones together

To everything - turn, turn, turn  
There is a season - turn, turn, turn  
And a time to every purpose under heaven

A time of love, a time of hate  
A time of war, a time of peace  
A time you may embrace  
A time to refrain from embracing

To everything - turn, turn, turn  
There is a season - turn, turn, turn  
And a time to every purpose under heaven

A time to gain, a time to lose  
A time to rend, a time to sew  
A time for love, a time for hate  
A time for peace, I swear it's not too late!
