英国歌手Harry Styles时隔两年半携全新单曲《 **As It Was**
》强势回归，首周无悬念空降冠军宝座！此曲既是发自内心的哭泣，也是不可抗拒的舞池挑战！

仔细听《 _As It Was_
》这首歌，你会发现歌词是在失去和孤独的抒情探索。复古活泼的背后带着一点悲伤，比起拥有家的感觉，更像一切都失去以后的遗憾与回忆，你带着孩子们走了，一切都不像以前那样了，只剩下这个空荡荡的home，幸福喧嚣的美梦破碎后玻璃渣子落了一地，由午后的沉寂回归了现实，深深渗透了孤独和忧郁的情感！

可以说，《As It Was》是Harry
Styles创作过的最具感染力的歌曲之一。他唱到了如何面对个人的转变，副歌部分写道:“在这个世界上，只有我们/你知道，现在和以前不一样了。”充满了情感的脆弱！

### As It Was歌词：

Come on Harry we wanna say "Goodnight" to you  
Holding me back gravity's holding me back  
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand  
Why don't we leave it at that  
Nothing to say and everything gets in the way  
Seems you cannot be replaced  
And I'm the one who will stay oh oh oh  
In this world it's just us  
You know it's not the same as it was  
In this world it's just us  
You know it's not the same as it was  
As it was as it was  
You know it's not the same  
Answer the phone "Harry you're no good alone  
Why are you sitting at home on the floor  
What kinda pills are you on"  
Ringing the bell and nobody's coming to help  
Your daddy lives by himself  
He just wants to know that you're well oh oh oh  
In this world it's just us  
You know it's not the same as it was  
In this world it's just us  
You know it's not the same as it was  
As it was as it was  
You know it's not the same  
Go home get ahead light-speed internet  
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was  
Leave America two kids follow her  
I don't wanna talk about who's doing it first  
Hey  
As it was  
You know it's not the same as it was  
As it was as it was
