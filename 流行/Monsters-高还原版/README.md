《 **Monsters** 》原是Katie
Sky演唱的歌曲，收录在于2014年5月11日发行的专辑《Monsters》中。此曲很好听，被反复翻唱。其中，周深在某综艺节目里选择它作为参赛歌曲。

这是一首非常治愈的歌曲。原唱Katie
Sky通过温柔且富有力量的嗓音，向听众传递了一种果敢且坚定的信念：不管你正在面临怎样的苦难，我都愿意和你一起承担。而周深的演唱是另一种美感，胜在节奏把握到位，舞台足够活泼。Katie
Sky 本人也看过周深的翻唱，也是赞不绝口！

### Monsters歌词：

I see your monsters I see your pain  
Tell me your problems I'll chase them away  
I'll be your lighthouse  
I'll make it okay  
When I see your monsters  
I'll stand there so brave  
And chase them all away  
In the dark we we  
We stand apart we we  
Never see that the things we need are staring right at us  
You just want to hide hide hide  
Never show your smile smile  
Stand alone when you need someone it's the hardest thing of all  
That you see are the bad bad bad  
Bad memories take your time and you'll find me  
I see your monsters I see your pain  
Tell me your problems I'll chase them away  
I'll be your lighthouse I'll make it okay  
When I see your monsters I'll stand there so brave  
And chase them all away  
I could see the sky sky sky  
Beautiful tonight night  
When you breathe why can't you see that the clouds are in your head  
I would stay there there there  
There's no need to fear fear  
And when you need to talk it out with someone you can trust  
What you see are the bad bad bad  
Bad memories take your time and you'll find me  
I see your monsters I see your pain  
Tell me your problems I'll chase them away  
I'll be your lighthouse I'll make it okay  
When I see your monsters I'll stand there so brave  
And chase them all away  
I'll chase them all away  
You've got the chance to see the light  
Even in the darkest night  
And I'll be here like you were for me  
So just let me in  
Cause I see your monsters I see your pain  
Tell me your problems I'll chase them away  
I'll be your lighthouse I'll make it okay  
When I see your monsters I'll stand there so brave  
I see your monsters I see your pain  
Tell me your problems I'll chase them away  
I'll be your lighthouse I'll make it okay  
When I see your monsters I'll stand there so brave  
And chase them all away
