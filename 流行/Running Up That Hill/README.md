**Running Up That Hill双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Running Up That Hill_ 是歌手Kate Bush演唱的歌曲。Kate
Bush的演唱完全无法区分风格，三个八度自由跳跃的嗓音，可以从《呼啸山庄》这样的文学作品中汲取音乐的精魂，使得她的歌曲充满了自己的特点，无人可以模仿她，她当然也没有兴趣将别人的歌曲原版翻唱。她无疑是女性另类音乐的划时代的开拓者，狂野的天籁之音永远是她的标志，诡异、梦幻、凄美永远是她的关键词。受到她的音乐和演唱风格影响的人更是无数，包括Tori
Amos、Bjork。

1985年8月5日，Kate Bush在BBC TV’s Wogan show上表演了Running up that
hill。赞扬从四面八方飞来。“令人震惊的……印象深刻的，感动”……18个月内，NME承认该曲是英国乐史上非黑人艺人最佳单曲。

### Running Up That Hill歌词：

If I only could, I'd be running up that hill.  
If I only could, I'd be running up that hill."  
It doesn't hurt me.  
Do you want to feel how it feels?  
Do you want to know that it doesn't hurt me?  
Do you want to hear about the deal that I'm making?  
You, it's you and me.  
And if I only could,  
I'd make a deal with God,  
And I'd get him to swap our places,  
Be running up that road,  
Be running up that hill,  
Be running up that building.  
If I only could, oh...  
You don't want to hurt me,  
But see how deep the bullet lies.  
Unaware I'm tearing you asunder.  
Ooh, there is thunder in our hearts.  
Is there so much hate for the ones we love?  
Tell me, we both matter, don't we?  
You, it's you and me.  
It's you and me won't be unhappy.  
And if I only could,  
I'd make a deal with God,  
And I'd get him to swap our places,  
Be running up that road,  
Be running up that hill,  
Be running up that building,  
Say, if I only could, oh...  
You,  
It's you and me,  
It's you and me won't be unhappy.  
"C'mon, baby, c'mon darling,  
Let me steal this moment from you now.  
C'mon, angel, c'mon, c'mon, darling,  
Let's exchange the experience, oh..."  
And if I only could,  
I'd make a deal with God,  
And I'd get him to swap our places,  
Be running up that road,  
Be running up that hill,  
With no problems.  
And if I only could,  
I'd make a deal with God,  
And I'd get him to swap our places,  
Be running up that road,  
Be running up that hill,  
With no problems.  
And if I only could,  
I'd make a deal with God,  
And I'd get him to swap our places,  
Be running up that road,  
Be running up that hill,  
With no problems.  
If I only could  
Be running up that hill  
With no problems...  
"If I only could, I'd be running up that hill.  
If I only could, I'd be running up that hill.
