### Don't Leave Me Alone歌词：

I don't wanna lie can we be honest  
Right now while you're sitting on my chest  
I don't know what I'd do without your comfort  
If you really go first if you really left  
I don't know if I would be alive today  
With or without you like night and day  
Read and repeat every conversation  
Being with you every day is a Saturday  
But every Sunday you've got me praying  
Don't you ever leave me don't you ever go  
I've seen it on TV I know how it goes  
Even when you're angry even when I'm cold  
Don't you ever leave me don't leave me alone  
Don't leave me a  
Ah ah alone  
Ah ah ha  
Ah ah alone  
Ah ah  
I don't wanna call and you don't answer  
Never see your face light up my phone  
Never see you singing tiny dancer  
Every time my head hurts every time I'm low  
Cause I don't know if I would be alive today  
With or without you like night and day  
Everything about you uncomplicated  
Here with you every day is a Saturday  
But every Sunday you've got me praying  
Don't you ever leave me don't you ever go  
I've seen it on TV I know how it goes  
Even when you're angry even when I'm cold  
Don't you ever leave me don't leave me alone  
Don't leave me a  
Ah ah alone  
Ah ah ha  
Ah ah alone  
Ah ah  
Don't you ever leave me  
Don't you ever go  
Don't you ever leave me  
No oh  
Don't you ever leave me don't you ever go  
I've seen it on TV I know how it goes  
Even when you're angry even when I'm cold  
Don't you ever leave me don't leave me alone  
Don't you ever leave me don't you ever go  
I've seen it on TV I know how it goes  
Even when you're angry even when I'm cold  
Don't you ever leave me don't leave me alone  
Even when you're angry even when I'm cold  
Don't you ever leave me don't leave me alone
