### Lost Control歌词：

Mirrors they never lie  
Don't see myself inside  
Why can't I get it right  
I don't know  
You're always watching me fall  
Shadows they like my wall  
Why do I feel so small  
I don't know  
So I walk into the dead of night  
Where my monsters like to hide  
Chaos feels so good inside  
Now I know  
I lost  
I lost  
I lost control again  
Always do the same and I'm to blame  
I lost control again  
I don't  
I don't  
I don't know who I am  
Always do the same and I'm to blame  
I lost control again  
Oooh  
I'm tired of being afraid  
But lately I lost my faith  
What is love without pain  
It ain't home  
You're watching me but I'm below  
When I get caught I hope  
It's that kind of blackout that will  
Take me home  
So I walk into the dead of night  
Where my monsters like to hide  
Chaos feels so good inside  
Now I know  
I lost  
I lost  
I lost control again  
Always do the same and I'm to blame  
I lost control again  
I don't  
I don't  
I don't know who I am  
Always do the same and I'm to blame  
I lost control again  
I know that I'm a mess  
But I ain't tryna be the best  
So whatever's coming next  
I'd better pray  
Never said I was an angel  
I am damaged all the way  
So whatever's coming next  
I'd better pray  
I lost  
I lost  
I lost control again  
Always do the same and I'm to blame  
I lost control again  
I don't  
I don't  
I don't know who I am  
Always do the same and I'm to blame  
I lost control again
