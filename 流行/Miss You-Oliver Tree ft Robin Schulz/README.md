### Miss You歌词：

Don't remind me  
I'm mindin' my own d**n business  
Don't try to find me  
I'm better left alone than in this  
It doesn't surprise me  
Do you really think that I could care  
If you really don't like me  
Find somebody else  
It could be anyone else out there  
Don't fret  
I don't ever wanna see you  
And I never wanna meet you again  
One thing  
When you're angry you're a jerk  
And then you treat me like I'm worth nothin'  
Don't fret  
I don't ever wanna see you  
And I never wanna meet you again  
It'll happen again  
I watch it happen over and over again  
Don't fret  
I don't ever wanna see you  
And I never wanna meet you again  
One thing  
When you're angry you're a jerk  
And then you treat me like I'm worth nothin'  
Don't remind me  
I'm mindin' my own d**n business  
Don't try to find me  
I'm better left alone than in this  
It doesn't surprise me  
Do you really think that I could care  
If you really don't like me  
Find somebody else  
It could be anyone else out there  
Don't fret  
I don't ever wanna see you  
And I never wanna meet you again  
One thing  
When you're angry you're a jerk  
And then you treat me like I'm worth nothin'  
Don't fret  
I don't ever wanna see you  
And I never wanna meet you again  
It'll happen again  
I watch it happen over and over again  
Don't fret  
I don't ever wanna see you  
And I never wanna meet you again  
One thing  
When you're angry you're a jerk  
And then you treat me like I'm worth nothin'
