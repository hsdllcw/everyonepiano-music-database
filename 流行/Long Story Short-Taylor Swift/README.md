### Long Story Short歌词：

Fatefully  
I tried to pick my battles 'til the battle picked me  
Misery  
Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep  
And you passed right by  
I was in the alley surrounded on all sides  
The knife cuts both ways  
If the shoe fits walk in it 'til your high heels break  
And I fell from the pedestal  
Right down the rabbit hole  
Long story short it was a bad time  
Pushed from the precipice  
Clung to the nearest lips  
Long story short it was the wrong guy  
Now I'm all about you  
I'm all about you ah  
Yeah yeah  
I'm all about you ah  
Yeah yeah  
Actually  
I always felt I must look better in the rear view  
Missing me  
At the golden gates they once held the keys to  
When I dropped my sword  
I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door  
And we live in peace  
But if someone comes at us  
This time I'm ready  
'Cause I fell from the pedestal  
Right down the rabbit hole  
Long story short it was a bad time  
Pushed from the precipice  
Clung to the nearest lips  
Long story short it was the wrong guy  
Now I'm all about you  
I'm all about you ah  
Yeah yeah  
I'm all about you ah  
No more keeping score  
Now I just keep you warm  
Keep you warm  
No more tug of war  
Now I just know there's more  
Know there's more  
No more keeping score  
Now I just keep you warm  
Keep you warm  
And my waves meet your shore  
Ever and evermore  
Past me  
I wanna tell you not to get lost in these petty things  
Your nemeses  
Will defeat themselves before you get the chance to swing  
And he's passing by  
Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky  
And he feels like home  
If the shoe fits walk in it  
Everywhere you go  
And I fell from the pedestal  
Right down the rabbit hole  
Long story short it was a bad time  
Pushed from the precipice  
Climbed right back up the cliff  
Long story short I survived  
Now I'm all about you  
I'm all about you ah  
I'm all about you  
I'm all about you  
Yeah yeah  
I'm all about you  
Yeah yeah  
I'm all about you  
Long story short it was a bad time  
Long story short I survived
