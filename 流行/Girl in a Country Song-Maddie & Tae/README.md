### Girl in a Country Song歌词：

("No country music was harmed in the making of this song, this is only a test-
t-t")

Well I wish I had some shoes on my two bare feet  
And it's gettin' kinda cold in these painted on cut off jeans  
I hate the way this bikini top chafes  
Do I really have to wear it all day? (Yeah baby)

I hear you over there on your tailgate whistlin' [*whistle*]  
Sayin', "Hey girl"  
But you know I ain't listenin'  
Cause I got a name  
And to you it ain't "pretty little thing", "honey" or "baby"  
Yeah it's drivin' me red-red-red-red-red-red-red neck crazy

[Chorus:]  
Bein' the girl in a country song  
How in the world did it go so wrong?  
Like all we're good for  
Is looking good for you and your friends on the weekend  
Nothing more  
We used to get a little respect  
Now we're lucky if we even get  
To climb up in your truck, keep my mouth shut and ride along  
And be the girl in a country song

Well shakin' my moneymaker ain’t ever made me a dime  
And there ain't no sugar for you in this shaker of mine  
Tell me one more time, "you gotta get you some of that"  
Sure I'll slide on over, but you’re gonna get slapped (Hah!)  
These days it ain't easy being that

[Chorus:]  
Girl in a country song  
How in the world did it go so wrong?  
Like all we're good for  
Is looking good for you and your friends on the weekend  
Nothing more  
We used to get a little respect  
Now we're lucky if we even get  
To climb up in your truck, keep my mouth shut and ride along  
And be the girl in a country song (Yeah, yeah baby)

Aww no, Conway and George Strait  
Never did it this way  
Back in the old days  
Aww y'all, we ain't a cliché  
That ain't no way  
To treat a lady

[Chorus:]  
Like a girl in a country song  
How in the world did it go so wrong?  
Like all we're good for  
Is looking good for you and your friends on the weekend  
Nothing more  
We used to get a little respect  
Now we're lucky if we even get  
To climb up in your truck, keep my mouth shut and ride along  
Down some old dirt road we don't even wanna be on  
And be the girl in a country song

("Yeah baby, I ain't your tan legged Juliet. Can I put on some real clothes
now?")

Aww, no
