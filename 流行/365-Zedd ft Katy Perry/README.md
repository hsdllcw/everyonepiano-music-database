### 365歌词：

Waking up next to you in the middle of the week  
Never needed anyone to send me off to sleep  
And I know I said go slow but I can't hold back no more  
Got a premonition this ain't gonna be a fling  
You make a weekend feel like a year  
Baby you got me changing  
24/7 I want you here  
I hope you feel the same thing  
I want you to be the one that's on my mind on my mind on my mind  
I want you to be there around Monday night Tuesday night every night  
How you gonna be the one's that's on my mind 365 all the time  
I want you to be the one to stay  
And give me the night and day  
Love it when you come back and can't take it when you leave  
Got me fantasizing our initials already  
And I wanna just let go  
Falling deeper than before  
Say that you are ready  
I'll get off in a heartbeat  
I want you to be the one that's on my mind on my mind on my mind  
I want you to be there around Monday night Tuesday night every night  
How you gonna be the one's that's on my mind 365 all the time  
I want you to be the one to stay  
And give me the night and day  
I think about you all the time 24/7 365  
I think about you all the time 24/7 365  
Are you gonna be the one  
Are you gonna be the one  
I want you to be the one  
I want you to be the one that's on my mind on my mind on my mind  
I want you to be there around Monday night Tuesday night every night  
How you gonna be the one's that's on my mind 365 all the time  
I want you to be the one to stay  
And give me the night and day  
I think about you all the time 24/7 365  
I think about you all the time 24/7 365
