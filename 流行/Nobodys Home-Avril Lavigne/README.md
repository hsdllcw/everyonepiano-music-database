### Nobody's Home歌词：

I couldn't tell you  
Why she felt that way  
She felt it every day  
And I couldn't help her  
I just watched her make  
The same mistakes again  
What's wrong what's wrong now  
Too many too many problems  
Don't know where she belongs  
Where she belongs  
She wants to go home  
But nobody's home  
That's where she lies  
Broken inside  
With no place to go  
No place to go  
To dry her eyes  
Broken inside  
Open your eyes  
And look outside  
Find the reasons why  
You've been rejected  
And now you can't find  
What you've left behind  
Be strong be strong now  
Too many too many problems  
Don't know where she belongs  
Where she belongs  
She wants to go home  
But nobody's home  
That's where she lies  
Broken inside  
With no place to go  
No place to go  
To dry her eyes  
Broken inside

And her feelings she hides  
Her dreams she can't find  
She's losing her mind  
She's falling behind  
She can't find her place  
She's losing her faith  
She's falling from grace  
She's all over the place yeah  
She wants to go home  
But nobody's home  
That's where she lies  
Broken inside  
With no place to go  
No place to go  
To dry her eyes  
Broken inside  
She's lost inside lost inside  
She's lost inside lost inside  
She's lost inside lost inside
