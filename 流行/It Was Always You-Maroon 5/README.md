### It Was Always You歌词：

Woke up sweat and from a dream  
With a different kind of feeling  
All day long my heart was beating  
Searching for the meaning  
Hazel eyes  
I was so colorblind  
We were just wasting time  
For my all life  
we never cross the line  
Only friends in my mind  
But now I realize  
It was always you  
Can’t believe I could not see it all this time  
All this time  
It was always you  
Now I know why my heart wasn’t satisfied  
Satisfied  
It was always you ~ you ~  
No more guessing who  
Looking by now  
know it was always you  
Always you  
All my hidden desires finally come alive  
No I never told lieto you so why would I  
Start tonight  
Hazel eyes  
I was so colorblind  
We were just wasting time  
For my all life  
We never cross the line  
Only friends in my mind  
But now I realize  
It was always you  
Can’t believe I could not see it all this time  
All this time  
It was always you  
Now I know why my heart wasn’t satisfied  
Satisfied  
It was always you ~ you ~  
No more guess it who  
Looking by now  
Iknow it was always you  
Always you  
Woke up sweat and from a dream  
With a different kind of feeling  
It was always you  
Can’t believe I could not see it all this time  
All this time  
It was always you  
Now I know why my heart wasn’t satisfied  
Satisfied  
It was always you ~ you ~  
No more guessing who  
Looking by now  
I know it was always you  
Always you  
It was always you
