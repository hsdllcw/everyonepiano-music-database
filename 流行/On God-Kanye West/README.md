### On God歌词：

Yo Pi'erre Yo Pi'erre  
How you get so much favor on your side  
Accept Him as your Lord and Saviour I replied  
Thou should love thy neighbor not divide  
I'ma ride that's on God  
His lights shine the brightest in the dark  
Single mothers know they got my heart  
And all my brothers locked up on the yard  
You can still be anything you wanna be  
Went from one in four to one in three  
Thirteenth amendment  
Gotta' end it that's on me  
He the new commander and the chief  
That's on Keef  
That's on God  
Before the ranch  
I had horses in the garage  
When the Forbes cover was just a mirage  
They had me chasin' statues that's on pride  
Oh my God Bust said  
That's on tribe  
When I thought the Book of Job was a job  
The Devil had my soul I can't lie  
Life gon' have some lows and some highs  
Before the Grammy's ever gave a nod  
I wore my heart on my sleeve I couldn't hide  
In '03 they told me not to drive  
I bleached my hair for every time I could've died  
But I survived that's on God  
I've been tellin' y'all since '05  
The greatest artist restin' or alive  
That's on L.A. Reid that's on Clive  
That's no Jive that's on God  
Off the 350s he supplied  
The IRS want they fifty plus our tithe  
Man that's over half of the pot  
I felt dry that's on God  
That's why I charge the prices that I charge  
I can't be out here dancin' with the stars  
No I cannot let my family starve  
I go hard that's on God  
Yo Pi'erre you wanna come out here  
Okay  
Okay  
Okay  
Okay okay okay okay
