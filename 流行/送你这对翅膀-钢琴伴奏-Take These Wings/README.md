### 送你这对翅膀歌词：

I found a sparrow lying on the ground;  
Her life I knew would soon be at an end.  
I knelt before her as she made a sound,  
and listened as she said. "My friend.  
Take these wings and learn to fly  
to the highest mountain in the sky;  
Take these eyes and learn to see  
all the things so dear to me.  
Take this song and learn to sing,  
fill your voice with all the joys of spring;  
Take this heart and set it free,  
Let it fly﹝Let it fly, let it fly﹞  
beyond the sea."  
I found another sparrow lying on the sand,  
A tiny bird whose life had just begun.  
I picked him and held him in my hand;  
I smiled at him and said, "My son.  
Take these wings and learn to fly  
to the highest mountain in the sky;  
Take these eyes and learn to see  
all the things so dear to me.  
Take this song and learn to sing,  
fill your voice with all the joys of spring;  
Take this heart and set it free,  
Let it fly﹝Let it fly, let it fly﹞  
beyond the sea."
