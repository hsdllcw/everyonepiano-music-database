### What Now歌词：

演唱：Rihanna

  
I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat  
I shouldn't be crying  
Tears were for the weaker days  
I'm stronger now or so I say  
But something's missing

Whatever it is, it feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-
sided mirror  
Whatever it is, it's just sitting there laughing at me  
And I just wanna scream

What now? I just can't figure it out  
What now? I guess I'll just wait it out  
What now? ohhhh what now?

I found the one he changed my life  
But was it me that changed  
And he just happened to come at the right time  
I'm supposed to be in love  
But i'm not mugging

Whatever it is, it feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-
sided mirror  
Whatever it is, it's just sitting there laughing at me  
And I just wanna scream

What now? I just can't figure it out  
What now? I guess I'll just wait it out  
What now? please tell me  
What now?

There's no one to call cause im just playing games with them all  
The most where im happy, the more that im feeling alone  
Cause I spent every hour just going through the motions  
I cant even get the emotions to come out  
Dry as a bone, but I just wanna shout

What now? I just can't figure it out  
What now? I guess I'll just wait it out  
What now? somebody tell me  
What now?

I dont know where to go  
I dont know what to feel  
I dont know how to cry  
I dont know ow ow why  
I dont know where to go  
I dont know what to feel  
I dont know how to cry  
I dont know ow ow why  
I dont know where to go  
I dont know what to feel  
I dont know how to cry  
I dont know ow ow why

So what now?
