### Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!歌词：

Oh, the weather outside is frightful  
But the fire is so delightful  
And since we've no place to go  
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow,  
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow,  
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow  
It doesn't show signs of stopping  
And I've bought some corn for popping  
The lights are turned away down low  
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow,  
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow,  
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow  
When we finally kiss goodnight  
How I'll hate going out in the storm  
But if you'll really hold me tight  
All the way home  
I'll be warm  
The fire is slowly dying  
And, my dear, we're still good-bying  
But as long as you love me so  
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow,  
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow,  
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow  
When we finally kiss goodnight  
How I'll hate going out in the storm  
But if you'll really hold me tight  
All the way home  
I'll be warm  
The fire is slowly dying  
And my dear, we're still good-bying  
But as long as you love me so  
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow,  
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow,  
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow  
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow,  
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow,  
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow  
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow,  
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow,  
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow
