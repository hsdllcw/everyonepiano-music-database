### Smooth歌词：

Man, it's a hot one  
Like seven inches from the midday sun  
Well, I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone  
But you stay so cool

My muñequita,  
My Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa  
You're my reason for reason  
The step in my groove, yeah.

[Bridge]  
And if you said, "This life ain't good enough."  
I would give my world to lift you up  
I could change my life to better suit your mood  
Because you're so smooth

[Chorus]  
And it's just like the ocean under the moon  
Well, that's the same as the emotion that I get from you  
You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth, yeah.  
Gimme your heart, make it real  
Or else forget about it

Well, I'll tell you one thing  
If you would leave it'd be a crying shame  
In every breath and every word  
I hear your name calling me out

Out from the barrio,  
You hear my rhythm on your radio  
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow  
Turning you 'round and 'round

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

Or else forget about it  
Or else forget about it  
Oh, let's don't forget about it  
(Gimme your heart, make it real)  
Let's don't forget about it (hey)  
Let's don't forget about it (no oh no oh)  
Let's don't forget about it (no no no oh)  
Let's don't forget about it (hey no no oh)  
Let's don't forget about it (hey hey hey)
