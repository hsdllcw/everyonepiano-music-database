### Forget Me Too歌词：

Machine Gun Kelly：  
Let me take my f**king bracelet off  
You want me to forget you  
Okay forget me too  
You tell me you hate me baby  
Yeah I bet you do  
D**n  
I saw you walk in the room and I tried my best  
Not to panic while I'm lookin' for the back door  
I smell the perfume and it's obvious  
I'm gonna stay and put my key in the back more  
I can't I can't I can't pretend to forget you  
The reason I punched a hole in the wall back home  
And then and then  
And then a couple hours later we're in room 29 at The Chateau  
I left before you woke up  
I don't feel right  
See you sober  
You want me to forget you  
Okay forget me too  
You tell me that you hate me baby  
Yeah I bet you do  
I'm keepin' you waitin'  
But I won't wait on you  
Want me to forget you  
Okay forget me too  
Halsey：  
I've wasted so much time  
Waitin' around for your phone calls every night  
My bad dreams are silk screens  
'Cause I taste blood when you bleed  
It's eating me alive  
We'd both be better off alone  
Still think I'd get you on the phone  
With one last breath in me  
I'd die before I let you leave  
You left before I woke up  
Why don't I ever see you sober  
You want me to forget you  
Okay forget me too  
You tell me that you hate me baby  
Yeah I bet you do  
I'm keepin' you waitin'  
But I won't wait on you  
You want me to forget you  
Okay forget me too  
Both：  
Hey you  
Tell me why you do the things that make me hate you  
It's an emotional kaleidoscope when I face you  
Permanent calligraphy I just tattooed your name on me forever  
You want me to forget you  
Okay forget me too  
You tell me that you hate me baby  
Yeah I bet you do  
I'm keepin' you waitin'  
But I won't wait on you  
You want me to forget you  
Okay forget me too
