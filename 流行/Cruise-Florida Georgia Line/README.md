### Cruise歌词：

Baby you a song  
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise  
Hey baby  
When I first saw that bikini top on her  
She''s poppin'' right out of the South Georgia water  
Thought ol'' good lord she had them long tanned legs  
Couldn''t help myself so I walked up and said  
Baby you a song  
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise  
Down a back road blowin'' stop signs through the middle  
Every little farm town with you  
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit  
It''d look a hell lot better with you up in it  
So baby you a song  
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise  
She was sippin'' on southern and singin'' bars of tucker  
We were falling in love in the sweet heart of summer  
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said  
Fire it up let''s go get this thing stuck  
Baby you a song  
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise  
Down a back road blowin'' stop signs through the middle  
Every little farm town with you  
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit  
It''d look a hell lot better with you up in it  
So baby you a song  
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise  
When that summer sun fell to its knees  
I looked at her and she looked at me  
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night  
Cause it felt so right, her and I, man we felt so right  
I put it in parking  
Grabbed my guitar  
And strummed a couple chords  
And sang from the heart  
Girl you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin''  
Hell I can''t get you out of my head  
Baby you a song  
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise  
Down a back road blowin'' stop signs through the middle  
Every little farm town with you  
Baby you a song  
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise  
Down a back road blowin'' stop signs through the middle  
Every little farm town with you  
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit  
It''d look a hell lot better with you up in it  
Come on  
Baby you a song  
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise  
Come on girl  
Get those windows down and cruise  
Aww yea
