### My Happy Ending歌词：

Oh~ Oh!  
So much for my happy ending  
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...  
Let's talk this over/让我们好好谈谈吧  
It's not like we're dead/像我们之间还未结束那样  
Was it something I did?/是我做了什么  
Was it something You said?/还是你说了什么  
Don't leave me hanging/别把我丢下  
In a city so dead/在这个死寂的城市  
Held up so high/有点恐惧  
On such a breakable thread/我们之间的关系岌岌可危  
You were all the things I thought I knew/我曾天真的以为我很了解你  
And I thought we could be/我们可以永远在一起  
You were everything, everything that I wanted/曾经，你是我梦寐以求的一切  
We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it/我们本命中注定要在一起，但却事与愿违  
And all of the memories, so close to me, just fade away/那些记忆感觉如此清晰却又淡淡逝去  
All this time you were pretending/一直以来 你努力假装着  
So much for my happy ending/只为给我一个快乐结局  
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...  
So much for my happy ending/这就是我的快乐结局  
You've got your dumb friends/你的那些愚蠢的朋友们  
I know what they say/我知道他们会说什麼  
They tell you I'm difficult/他们会告诉你我很难相处  
But so are they/但其实他们也一样  
But they don't know me/但他们并不了解我  
Do they even know you?/他们甚至连你也不了解  
All the things you hide from me/一切你对我隐藏的事  
All the shit that you do/那些你不愿提起的苟且之事  
You were all the things I thought I knew/曾经我以为我很了解你  
And I thought we could be/以为我们能永远走下去  
You were everything, everything that I wanted/曾经，你是我梦寐以求的一切  
We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it/我们本命中注定要在一起，但却事与愿违  
And all of the memories, so close to me, just fade away/那些记忆感觉如此清晰却又淡淡逝去  
All this time you were pretending/一直以来 你努力假装着  
So much for my happy ending/只为给我一个快乐结局  
It's nice to know that you were there/真的很开心你曾陪在我身边  
Thanks for acting like you cared/也谢谢你假装你还在乎  
And making me feel like I was the only one/让我傻傻的以为 我就是你的唯一  
It's nice to know we had it all/感谢你给的所有的虚幻的回忆  
Thanks for watching as I fall/也谢谢你在我跌倒的时候冷眼旁观  
And letting me know we were done/让我终于明白 我们要结束了  
He was everything, everything that I wanted/曾经，他是我梦寐以求的一切  
We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it/我们本命中注定要在一起，但却事与愿违  
And all of the memories, so close to me, just fade away/那些记忆感觉如此清晰却又淡淡逝去  
All this time you were pretending/一直以来 你努力假装着

We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it/我们本命中注定要在一起，但却事与愿违  
And all of the memories, so close to me, just fade away/那些记忆感觉如此清晰却又淡淡逝去  
All this time you were pretending/一直以来 你努力假装着  
So much for my happy ending/只为给我一个快乐结局  
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...
