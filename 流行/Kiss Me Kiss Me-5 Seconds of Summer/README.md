### Kiss Me Kiss Me歌词：

Whoa-oh-oh  
Whoa-oh  
Here's to teenage memories

Whoa-oh-oh  
Whoa-oh  
Here's to teenage memories

Can I call wake you up on a Sunday?  
Late night, I think we need to get away.  
Head lights, hold tight turn the radio loud.  
Let me know where to go and I'll get you there.  
Tell the truth and I'll show you how to dare.  
Flash lights held tight we could own this town.  
Never say goodbye.

And so kiss me, kiss me, kiss me  
And tell me that I'll see you again  
'Cause I don't know,  
If I can let you go

And so kiss me, kiss me, kiss me  
I'm dying just to see you again  
Let's make tonight  
The best of our lives,  
Yeah.  
Here's to teenage memories

Whoa-oh-oh  
Whoa-oh  
Here's to teenage memories

Close your eyes you'll be mine and it's alright.  
Take a breath no rest till the sunrise.  
Heartbeat so sweet, when your lips touch mine.  
We don't have to go home right now,  
We're never gonna stop 'cause we're dreaming out loud.  
We know what we want, we know we're going to get it somehow.  
Never say goodbye

And so kiss me, kiss me, kiss me  
And tell me that I'll see you again  
'Cause I don't know,  
If I can let you go

So kiss me, kiss me, kiss me  
I'm dying just to see you again  
Let's make tonight  
The best of our lives,  
Yeah.  
Here's to teenage memories.  
Here's to teenage memories.

And so kiss me, kiss me, kiss me  
And tell me that I'll see you again  
'Cause I don't know, if I can let you go

So kiss me, kiss me, kiss me  
I'm dying just to see you again  
Let's make tonight  
The best of our lives,  
Yeah.  
Here's to teenage memories.

Whoa-oh-oh  
Whoa-oh  
Here's to teenage memories

Whoa-oh-oh  
Whoa-oh  
Here's to teenage, memories
