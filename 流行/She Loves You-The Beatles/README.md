### She Loves You歌词：

She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah  
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah  
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah  
You think youve lost your love  
Well, I saw her yesterday-yi-yay  
Its you shes thinking of  
And she told me what to say-yi-yay  
She says she loves you  
and you know that cant be bad  
Yes, she loves you  
and you know you should be glad  
She said you hurt her so  
She almost lost her mind  
And now she says she knows  
Youre not the hurting kind  
She says she loves you  
and you know that cant be bad  
Yes, she loves you  
and you know you should be glad  
Oo, she loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah  
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah  
And with a love like that  
You know you should be glad  
You know its up to you  
I think its only fair  
Pride can hurt you too  
Apologize to her  
Because she loves you  
and you know that cant be bad  
Yes, she loves you  
and you know you should be glad  
Oo, she loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah  
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah  
And with a love like that  
You know you should be glad  
And with a love like that  
you know you should be glad
