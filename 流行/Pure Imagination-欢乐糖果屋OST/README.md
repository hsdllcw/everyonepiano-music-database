Pure Imagination歌词：

  
Willy Wonka:  
[Spoken]  
Hold your breath  
Make a wish  
Count to three

[Sung]  
Come with me  
And you'll be  
In a world of  
Pure imagination  
Take a look  
And you'll see  
Into your imagination

We'll begin  
With a spin  
Traveling in  
The world of my creation  
What we'll see  
Will defy  
Explanation

If you want to view paradise  
Simply look around and view it  
Anything you want to, do it  
Wanta change the world?  
There's nothing  
To it

There is no  
Life I know  
To compare with  
Pure imagination  
Living there  
You'll be free  
If you truly wish to be

If you want to view paradise  
Simply look around and view it  
Anything you want to, do it  
Wanta change the world?  
There's nothing  
To it

There is no  
Life I know  
To compare with  
Pure imagination  
Living there  
You'll be free  
If you truly  
Wish to be
