Ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah  
Not like I'm countin' the days ah ah ah  
But it's been twenty-five ah ah ah  
You're out there killin' the game ah ah ah  
But d**n I miss you tonight ah ah mmm  
And I'm out at a party they're playin' our song  
I cry on the dance floor it's so embarrassing  
Don't send me photos you're makin' it worse  
'Cause you're so hot it's hurtin' my feelings  
I get a little lonely  
Get a little more close to me  
You're the only one who knows me babe  
So hot you're hurtin' my feelings woo  
Can't deal  
Before the X-rated dreamin' ah ah ah  
Back on the coast-to-coast life ah ah ah  
You know I live for the hustle ah ah ah  
But d**n I miss you tonight ah ah mmm  
And I'm out at a party they're playin' our song  
I cry on the dance floor it's so embarrassing  
Don't send me photos you're makin' it worse  
'Cause you're so hot it's hurtin' my feelings  
I get a little lonely  
Get a little more close to me  
You're the only one who knows me babe  
So hot you're hurtin' my feelings woo  
Can't deal  
Show me love na-na-na  
Na-na na-na-na  
Show me love na-na-na  
Na na na  
Show me love na-na-na  
Na-na na-na-na  
Show me love na-na-na  
Na-na-na-na  
And I'm out at a party they're playin' our song  
I cry on the dance floor it's so embarrassing  
Don't send me photos you're makin' it worse  
'Cause you're so hot it's hurtin' my feelings  
I get a little lonely  
Get a little more close to me  
You're the only one who knows me babe  
Only one who knows me babe  
So hot you're hurtin' my feelings woo  
Can't deal  
So hot you're hurtin' my feelings woo  
Can't deal woo  
So hot you're hurtin' my feelings woo  
Can't deal woo  
So hot you're hurtin' my feelings woo  
Can't deal
