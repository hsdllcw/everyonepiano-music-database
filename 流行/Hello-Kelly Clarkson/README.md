### Hello歌词：

Yes I stumbled into the night  
We're touching but I feel like you're still out of reach  
The people here are buzzing like a bug on a light  
I'm feeling like I always see them, but they can't see me  
Sentimental feelings  
Never get me anywhere  
My heart continues beating  
Is there anybody, anybody?  
Hello, hello  
Is anybody listening?  
Let go! As everyone lets go of mee  
Oh oh, won't somebody show me that I'm not alone, not alone  
Yeah I'm coming through this desert of stone  
These faces on the statues that I used to know  
Wishing I was more than what my story has told  
Or hoping that I'm dreaming in the day and this isn't happening  
Gotta keep it altogether  
Longing for a hand to hold  
Keep clear on the shadows  
Is there anybody, anybody?  
Hello, hello  
Is anybody listening?  
Let go! As everyone lets go of mee  
Oh oh, won't somebody show me that I'm not alone, not alone  
Holding on to the memories of when I, I didn't know  
Ignorance isn't wise but it beats being alone  
Hello,  
Is anybody listening?  
Let go! As everyone lets go of me  
Oh oh, won't somebody show me that I'm not alone, not alone  
Hello,  
Is anybody listening?  
Let go! As everyone lets go of me  
Oh oh, won't somebody show me that I'm not alone, not alone
