### Beautiful Now歌词：

I see what you're wearing, there's nothing beneath it  
Forgive me for staring, forgive me for breathing  
We might not know why, we might not know how  
But baby, tonight, we're beautiful now

We're beautiful now  
We're beautiful now

We might not know why, we might not know how  
But baby, tonight, we're beautiful now  
We'll light up the sky, we'll open the clouds  
Cause baby, tonight, we're beautiful now, we're beautiful [x2]

Wherever it's going, I'm gonna chase it  
What's left of this moment, I'm not gonna waste it  
Stranded together, our worlds have collided  
This won't be forever, so why try to fight it?

We're beautiful now  
We're beautiful now

We might not know why, we might not know how  
But baby, tonight, we're beautiful now  
We'll light up the sky, we'll open the clouds  
Cause baby, tonight, we're beautiful now, we're beautiful [x2]

Let's live tonight like fireflies  
And one by one light up the sky  
We disappear and pass the crown  
You're beautiful, you're beautiful

We're beautiful now  
We're beautiful now  
We're beautiful now  
We're beautiful now

We might not know why, we might not know how  
But baby, tonight, we're beautiful now  
We'll light up the sky, we'll open the clouds  
Cause baby, tonight, we're beautiful now, we're beautiful [x2]
