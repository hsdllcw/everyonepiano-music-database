### Bulletproof歌词：

I said don't go baby my heart's wide open for you  
But you went out and you found somebody new  
So tell me something that I don't already know  
Because this loneliness is starting to get old  
You gave up diamonds and roses and gold  
You gave up diamonds and roses and gold  
Don't you know baby that you can't fight fire with fire  
'Cause you fought so hard that you burned down your whole empire  
Because I'm strong but I'm not bulletproof bulletproof  
Because I'm strong but I'm not bulletproof bulletproof  
We shoulda fought it out  
Instead of giving up  
Instead of walkin' out  
Should have defended us  
And now you're saying that you need me baby  
But you gave up  
Oh you gave up  
You gave up diamonds and roses and gold  
You gave up diamonds and roses and gold  
Don't you know baby that you can't fight fire with fire  
'Cause you fought so hard that you burned down your whole empire  
'Cause I'm strong but I'm not bulletproof bulletproof  
'Cause I'm strong but I'm not bulletproof bulletproof  
Don't you know baby that you can't fight fire with fire  
'Cause you fought so hard that you burned down your whole empire  
'Cause I'm strong but I'm not bulletproof bulletproof  
'Cause I'm strong but I'm not bulletproof bulletproof  
'Cause I'm strong but I'm not bulletproof bulletproof  
'Cause I'm strong but I'm not bulletproof bulletproof
