_  
孤独的牧羊人_ 是音乐剧或电影《the sound of
music》/《音乐之声》的插曲。玛利亚带领孩子们为男爵夫人表演木偶剧，他们的表演和歌曲都十分幽默而风趣。该曲是由美国著名的流行音乐及音乐剧作曲家Richard
Rodgers创作的。他一生中获得过各类奖项：包括艾美奖、格林美奖、奥斯卡奖、东尼奖、普立兹奖等，他既是首位完成演艺圈大满贯（EGOT，即先后获得前面4项殊荣）的音乐家，亦是能在现今美国最主要的音乐颁奖礼中皆曾获取奖项的音乐人（能同样获得如此殊荣的，只有作曲家兼指挥马文•哈姆利奇）。

### 孤独的牧羊人歌词：

MARIA (sings)  
High on a hill was a lonely goatherd  
Lay ee odl lay ee odl lay hee hoo  
Loud was the voice of the lonely goatherd  
Lay ee odl lay ee odl-oo  
Folks in a town that was quite remote heard  
Lay ee odl lay ee odl lay hee hoo  
Lusty and clear from the goatherd's throat heard  
Lay ee odl lay ee odl-oo  
Above the stage, the children work the puppet strings. On stage, goats dance
alongside the shepherd.  
CHILDREN (singing)  
O ho lay dee odl lee o, o ho lay dee odl ay  
O ho lay dee odl lee o, lay dee odl lee o lay  
MARIA (whispers) Marta! Marta!  
Marta unrolls a new backdrop: a castle.  
MARIA (whispers) Gretl! The prince!  
Gretl shoves a prince puppet onstage.  
MARIA (sings)  
A prince on the bridge of a castle moat heard  
Lay ee odl lay ee odl lay hee hoo  
Two bearded male puppets with backpacks walk on.  
THE BOYS (singing)  
Men on a road with a load to tote heard  
Lay ee odl lay ee odl-oo  
A curtain rises to show: A beer hall. A puppet carrying many mugs of beer to
two men sitting at a table with forks and knives at the ready. Marionette
musicians play while marionette customers drink mugs of marionette beer.  
THE CHILDREN (singing)  
Men in the midst of a table d'hote heard  
Lay ee odl lay ee odl lay hee hoo  
MARIA (sings)  
Men drinking beer with the foam afloat heard  
Lay ee odl lay ee odl-oo  
Marta blows the foam from a beer and splashes Maria who coughs. A girl puppet
with blonde braids appears to join the shepherd.  
MARIA (sings)  
One little girl in a pale pink coat heard  
Lay ee odl lay ee odl lay hee hoo  
BRIGITTA (sings)  
She yodeled back to the lonely goatherd  
Lay ee odl lay ee odl-oo  
The blonde girl's bosomy mother appears and pushes the girl to the shepherd.  
MARIA (sings)  
Soon her Mama with a gleaming gloat heard  
Lay ee odl lay ee odl lay hee hoo  
What a duet for a girl and goatherd  
MARIA AND THE CHILDREN (singing)  
Lay ee odl lay ee odl-oo  
Mother and daughter dance with the shepherd. Three couples dance the polka as
the band continues to play. Above them, Maria and the children manipulate the
puppets with all the consummate skill of professional puppeteers like, oh, for
example, Bill and Cora Baird. Max, the Baroness, and the Captain laugh with
delight.  
MARIA AND THE CHILDREN (singing)  
Ummm (ummm) ...  
Odl lay ee (odl lay ee)  
Odl lay hee hee (odl lay hee hee)  
Odl lay ee ...  
Maria breaks out into a serious case of yodeling. She sighs, wipes her brow,
and signals to Marta for the next backdrop. Onstage, a boy and girl goat
replace the shepherd and his girlfriend.  
BRIGITTA (sings)  
One little girl in a pale pink coat heard  
MARIA (sings)  
Lay ee odl lay ee odl lay hoo hoo  
BRIGITTA (sings)  
She yodeled back to the lonely goatherd  
LIESL (sings)  
Lay ee odl lay ee odl-oo  
The girl goat's mother appears and bucks her daughter into the boy goat.  
MARIA (sings)  
Soon her Mama with a gleaming gloat heard  
Lay ee odl lay ee odl lay hmm hmm  
What a duet for a girl and goatherd  
Lay ee odl lay ee odl-oo  
The two goats snuggle and that's all it takes for a baby goat to appear and
dance with them. Apparently, the Austrian mountain goat is equipped with some
very advanced biological mechanisms.  
MARIA AND THE CHILDREN (singing)  
Happy are they lay dee olay dee lee o ...  
Lay ee odl lay ee odl lay hee hoo  
Soon the duet will become a trio  
MARIA (sings)  
Lay ee odl lay ee odl-oo  
MARIA AND THE CHILDREN (singing)  
Odl lay ee, odl lay ee (odl lay ee)  
Odl lay hee hee (odl lay hee hee),  
Odl lay ee (odl lay ee)  
Odl lay odl lay (odl lay odl lay),  
Odl lay odl lee (odl lay odl lee)  
Odl lay odl lee (odl lay odl lee)  
Odl lay odl lay odl lay  
THE CHILDREN  
Whoo!
