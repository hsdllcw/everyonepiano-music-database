### Superheroes歌词：

All the life, she has seen  
All the meaner side of me  
They took away the prophet's dream  
For a profit on the street  
Now she's stronger than you know  
A heart of steel starts to grow  
All his life, he's been told  
He'll be nothing when he's old  
All the kicks and all the blows  
He will never let it show  
Cause he's stronger than you know  
A heart of steel starts to grow  
When you've been fighting  
for it all your life  
You've been struggling to  
make things right  
That's how a superhero  
learns to fly  
When you've been fighting  
for it all your life  
You've been working every day  
and night  
That's how a superhero  
learns to fly  
All the hurt, all the lies  
All the tears that they cry  
When the moment is just right  
You'll see fire in their eyes  
Cause they're stronger  
than you know  
A heart of steel starts to grow  
When you've been fighting  
for it all your life  
You've been struggling to  
make things right  
That's how a superhero learns to fly  
When you've been fighting  
for it all your life  
You've been working every day  
and night  
Tha's how a superhero  
learns to fly  
Every day, every hour  
Turn the pain into power  
Every day, every hour  
Turn the pain into power  
Every day, every hour  
Turn the pain into power  
She's got a lions in her heart  
A fire in her soul  
He's a got a beast in his belly  
That's so hard to control  
Cause they've taken too much hits  
Taking blow by blow  
Now light them up, stand back,  
watch them explode  
She's got a lions in her heart  
A fire in her soul  
He's a got a beast in his belly  
That's so hard to control  
Cause they've taken too much hits  
Taking blow by blow  
Now light them up, stand back,  
watch them explode  
When you've been fighting  
for it all your life  
You've been struggling  
to make things right  
That's how a superhero  
learns to fly  
When you've been fighting  
for it all your life  
You've been working every day  
and night  
That's how a superhero  
learns to fly  
Every day, every hour  
Turn the pain into power  
Oh yeah  
Every day, every hour  
Turn the pain into power  
Ooh yeah  
Woah  
When you've been fighting  
for it all your life  
You've been struggling to  
make things right  
That's how a superhero learns to fly
