### WDIA (Would Do It Again)歌词：

Time didn't change me  
But what about you  
I think of you lately  
And I wonder if you do  
If you try to erase me  
Do I kill you in ways that kill me too  
'Cause I'll take all the pain all the bruises and blame  
And repeat it 'til I go insane  
If I could go back  
Chasing what we had  
Straight through the pitch black  
I would do it again  
You pull me inside  
Into your riptide  
Under a landslide  
But I would do it again  
I was a child  
Imitating a woman  
Caught in the wild  
And you trained me what to do  
And I was chained to the feeling  
The sickness the habit  
The highs and the tragic  
The depths that you fall to for love  
And I'll take all the pain shoot it inside my veins  
And repeat it 'til I go insane  
If I could go back  
Go go back  
Chasing what we had  
We we had  
Straight through the pitch black  
Pitch black  
I would do it again  
Again again again  
You pull me inside  
In inside  
Into your riptide  
Rip riptide  
Under a landslide  
Landslide  
I would do it again I would do it again yeah  
I would  
Lie to myself just to make you the truth  
I would  
Run through the flames to get closer of you  
I would  
If I could go back  
Go go back  
Chasing what we had  
We we had  
Straight through the pitch black  
Pitch black  
I would do it again  
Again again again  
You pull me inside  
In inside  
Into your riptide  
Rip riptide  
Under a landslide  
Landslide  
I would do it again  
I would do it again  
Yeah I would
