**Bam Bam** 是古巴裔美国流行乐女歌手Camila Cabello与英国歌手Ed
Sheeran合作的歌曲，收录在Cabello即将发行的第三张录音室专辑《Familia》中。

这是一首Cabello将充满希望、快乐和幸福的形象展现出来的歌曲。她将拉丁音乐的炽热，动感的元素带入主流的流行音乐。初听一遍就一整个爱住了，就像直接越过春天，进入炽热的初夏，又或者像在迈阿密海滩上，带上墨镜，手拿一杯椰汁，享受着美好的生活。同样这首歌也仿佛告诉我们，有什么困难渡不过呢？有什么事走不出来呢？That's
just life baby，是啊，这就是生活。

### Bam Bam歌词：

You said you hated the ocean, but you're surfin' now  
I said I'd love you for life, but I just sold our house  
We were kids at the start, I guess we're grown-ups now (Mmm)  
Couldn't ever imagine even havin' doubts  
But not everything works out, no  
Now I'm out dancin' with strangers  
You could be casually datin'  
Damn, it's all changin' so fast  
Así es la vida, sí  
Yeah, that's just life, baby  
Yeah, love came around  
And it knocked me down  
But I'm back on my feet  
Así es la vida, sí  
Yeah, that's just life, baby  
I was barely standin'  
But now I'm dancin'  
He's all over me  
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam  
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam  
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam  
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam (Así es la vida)  
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam (Uh-huh)  
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam (Eh, eh, uh-huh)  
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam (Uh-huh)  
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam  
It's been a hell of a year, thank God we made it out  
Yeah we were riding a wave, and trying not to drown  
And on the surface I held it together  
But underneath, I sorta came unwound  
Where would I be? You're all that I need  
My world, baby, you hold me down  
You always hold me down, now  
I've been the breaker and broken  
Every mistake turned to moments  
Wouldn't take anything back  
Así es la vida, sí (Así es)  
Yeah, that's just life, baby  
Yeah, love came around  
And it knocked me down  
But I'm back on my feet  
Así es la vida, sí  
Yeah, that's just life, baby  
I was barely standin'  
But now I'm dancin'  
She's all over me (He's all over me)  
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam  
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam  
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam  
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam (Ahí, ahí)  
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam  
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam  
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam  
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam (Pónganle azúcar, mi gente!)  
Sigue bailando, hey  
Sigue bailando (Keep dancing, yeah)  
Sigue bailando (Keep dancing, yeah)  
Sigue bailando  
(Hay amor en todos lados) Sigue bailando  
(Sigue, sigue, sigue bailando) Sigue bailando  
(Hay amor en todos lados) Sigue bailando, woh  
(Sigue, sigue, sigue bailando)  
Así es la vida, sí  
Yeah, that's just life, baby  
Yeah, love came around  
And it knocked me down  
But I'm back on my feet  
Así es la vida, sí  
Yeah, that's just life, baby  
I was barely standin'  
But now I'm dancin'  
She's all over me (He's all over me) (Hey! Hey!)  
Now I'm, Now I'm dancin' (Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam)  
Keep dancing, yeah  
Now I'm, Now I'm dancin' (Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam)  
Keep dancing, yeah  
Now I'm, Now I'm dancin' (Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam)  
Keep dancing, yeah (Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam) (Hey! Hey!)  
(Bidi, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam)  
And now I'm dancin' (Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam)  
Keep dancing, yeah  
Now I'm dancin' (Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam)  
Keep dancing, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam)  
Eh!
