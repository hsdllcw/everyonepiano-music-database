《 **Rasputin** 》（拉斯普京）是Boney M.于1978年8月28日发行的单曲，为第三张录音室专辑《Nightflight to
Venus》的第二首歌曲。

《 _Rasputin_
》曲调与土耳其民歌“Kâtibim”的后半部分相似，是一部关于二十世纪初俄罗斯沙皇尼古拉二世及其家人的朋友和顾问格里戈里•拉斯普廷的半传记歌曲。

这首歌以各种花哨的方式将拉斯普京描述为一名花花公子、神秘的治疗师和政治操纵者。

另外，此曲后被翻唱为不同的版本：  
《心上人》原曲旋律、晨曦填词、高凌风演唱。（收录于1979年宝丽金发行之迪斯科专辑）。  
《青春豆》原曲旋律、徐小明填词与演唱。（收录于1980年文志唱片公司发行之专辑）。  
《爱情真有趣》原曲旋律、林潇填词、高山演唱。（收录于1979年《热潮名曲：雨中情侣》大碟）。

### Rasputin歌词：

There lived a certain man in Russia long ago  
He was big and strong' in his eyes a flaming glow  
Most people looked at him with terror and with fear  
But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear  
He could preach the Bible like a preacher  
Full of ecstacy and fire  
But he also was the kind of teacher  
Women would desire  
There lived a certain man in Russia long ago  
He was big and strong' in his eyes a flaming glow  
Most people looked at him with terror and with fear  
But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear  
He could preach the Bible like a preacher  
Full of ecstacy and fire  
But he also was the kind of teacher  
Women would desire  
Ra ra rasputin  
Lover of the Russian queen  
There was a cat that really was gone  
Ra ra rasputin  
Russias greatest love machine  
It was a shame how he carried on  
He ruled the Russian land and never mind the czar  
But the kasachok he danced really wunderbar  
In all affairs of state he was the man to please  
But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze  
For the queen he was no wheeler dealer  
Though shed heard the things hed done  
She believed he was a holy healer  
Who would heal her son  
Ra ra rasputin  
Lover of the Russian queen  
There was a cat that really was gone  
Ra ra rasputin  
Russias greatest love machine  
It was a shame how he carried on  
But when his drinking and lusting  
And his hunger for power  
Became known to more and more people'  
The demands to do something about this outrageous  
Man became louder and louder  
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey  
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey  
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey  
Hey hey  
This mans just got to go  
Declared his enemies  
But the ladies begged  
Don't you try to do it' please  
No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms  
Though he was a brute they just fell into his arms  
Then one night some men of higher standing  
Set a trap they're not to blame  
Come to visit us they kept demanding  
And he really came  
Ra ra rasputin  
Lover of the Russian queen  
They put some poison into his wine  
Ra ra rasputin  
Russias greatest love machine  
He drank it all and he said I feel fine  
Ra ra rasputin  
Lover of the Russian queen  
They didnt quit' they wanted his head  
Ra ra rasputin  
Russias greatest love machine  
And so they shot him till he was dead  
Oh' those Russians
