If I tell you once won't tell you twice  
I'm real discreet like a thief in the night  
Look

If I call you bae you bae for the day  
Or a bae for the night you not my wife  
She want a killer to f**k all night  
I wanna f**k on a thot gimme head all night  
AP big rocks in the hood with the 'rillas  
Five K on the dinner bring three hundred thou' to the dealer  
Pop Smoke/Lil Baby：

If I tell you once won't tell you twice  
I'm real discreet like a thief in the night  
Baby  
Lil Baby：  
I'm rich but I'm ridin' I'm low on exotic  
I'm 'bout to fly out and go get me some  
Nothin' ain't seen all this money on me  
Hunnid racks in the bag that's honey bun  
Baby OG I been runnin' these streets  
Got the game from Lashawn I'm my mama's son  
Learned 'bout the triple cross when  
I was young and I know  
I ain't goin' so I keep a gun  
I flew to Paris just to buy some Dior  
She beggin' for attention I don't see her  
See I peeped Pop out wish  
That you could see us  
Me and Cash plus whenever I go re-up  
I got some n***as in the street won't beat me  
I got the industry tryna be me  
I just go Ray Charles they can't see me  
I'm in a Rolls-Royce with a RiRi  
Pop Smoke/DaBaby：  
I did some wrong  
Oh oh  
But I'm always right  
Oh oh  
Said I know how to shoot  
Oh oh  
And I know how to fight  
If I tell you once won't tell you twice  
I'm real discreet like a thief in the night  
Yeah  
DaBaby/Pop Smoke：  
Like a thief in the night  
Thief  
I pull up give her D for the night  
Uh-huh

We can't f**k up my seats 'cause they white  
That's my seats watch my motherf**kin' seats  
I'm livin' like "Thriller"  
I only come out at the night time  
She don't f**k with liquor don't like bein' tipsy  
She don't do the Henny just white wine

Park the Porsche and pull up in a Lambo  
Hmph

Cuban link full of rocks it's a choker  
Oh  
Rest in peace to the Pop make me smoke ya  
Pop Smoke：  
I did some wrong

But I'm always right  
Oh oh  
Said I know how to shoot  
Oh oh  
And I know how to fight  
If I tell you once won't tell you twice  
I'm real discreet like a thief in the night
