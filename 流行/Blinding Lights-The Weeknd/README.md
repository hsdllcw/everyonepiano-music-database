**Blinding Lights双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Blinding Lights_ 是加拿大创作型歌手The Weeknd演唱的歌曲。浓浓的复古disco风，听到前奏就让人忍不住跟着恣意摇摆。The
Weeknd的音乐不愧为“听觉的慢性麻醉药”。不过从歌词里可以看出他依然是那个外表桀骜不驯，内心脆弱敏感的Abel，他身上那种阴郁的艺术气质，与他作品里的颓丧气息和暗黑风格融为一体，唱出了这个信息爆炸的虚拟时代里，孤独敏感的年轻一代的心声。

### Blinding Lights歌词：

Yeah  
I've been tryna call  
I've been on my own for long enough  
Maybe you can show me how to love  
Maybe  
I'm going through withdrawals  
You don't even have to do too much  
You can turn me on with just a touch baby  
I look around and  
Sin city's cold and empty  
Oh  
No one's around to judge me  
Oh  
I can't see clearly when you're gone  
Oh oh  
I said ooh I'm blinded by the lights  
No I can't sleep until I feel your touch  
I said ooh I'm drowning in the night  
Oh when I'm like this you're the one I trust  
Hey hey hey  
I'm running out of time  
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky  
So I hit the road in overdrive baby oh  
The city's cold and empty  
Oh  
No one's around to judge me  
Oh  
I can't see clearly when you're gone  
Oh oh  
I said ooh I'm blinded by the lights  
No I can't sleep until I feel your touch  
I said ooh I'm drowning in the night  
Oh when I'm like this you're the one I trust  
I'm just walking by to let you know  
By to let you know  
I can never say it on the phone  
Say it on the phone  
Will never let you go this time  
Ooh  
I said ooh I'm blinded by the lights  
No I can't sleep until I feel your touch  
Hey hey hey  
Hey hey hey  
I said ooh I'm blinded by the lights  
No I can't sleep until I feel your touch
