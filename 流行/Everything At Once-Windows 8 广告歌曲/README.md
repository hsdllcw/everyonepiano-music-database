### Everything At Once(Windows 8 广告歌曲)英文歌词：

**演唱：Lenka**

As sly as a fox as strong as an ox  
As fast as a hare as brave as a bear  
As free as a bird as neat as a word  
As quiet as a mouse as big as a house  
Ah …… Are you wanna be  
Ah …… Are you wanna be  
Ohhh ah …… Are you wanna be  
Is everything  
As mean as a wolf as sharp as a tooth  
As deep as a bite as dark as the night  
As sweet as a song as right as a wrong  
As long as a road as ugly as a toad  
As pretty as a picture hanging from a fixture  
Strong like a family strong as I wanna be  
Bright as day as light as play  
As hard as nails as grand as a whale  
Ah…… Are you wanna be  
Ohhh ah …… Are you wanna be  
Ohhh ah …… Are you wanna be  
Is everything  
Everything at once  
Everything at once  
Ahh everything at once  
As warm as the sun as silly as fun  
As cool as a tree as scary as the sea  
As hot as fire cold as ice  
Sweet as sugar and everything nice  
As old as time as straight as a line  
As royal as a queen as buzzed as a bee  
Stealth as a tiger smooth as a glide  
Pure as a melody pure as I wanna be  
Ah …… Are you wanna be,  
Ohhh ah …… Are you wanna be  
Ohhh ah …… Are you wanna be  
Is everything  
Everything at once

### Everything At Once(Windows 8 广告歌曲)歌词中文对照：

像狐狸一样狡猾 像牛一样强壮

像野兔一样快 像熊一样勇敢

像鸟一样悠闲 像字一样工整

像老鼠一样安静 像房子一样宽大

你想要成为吗

你想要成为吗

啊 你想要成为吗

所有的事物

像狼一样卑鄙 像牙一样尖锐

像伤痕一样深 像夜晚一样黑

像歌曲一样甜 像对的也像错的 像路一样长 像蛤蟆一样丑

像挂在夹子中的图画一样美丽

像一个家族那样强大 像我想象的那样强大 像白天一样亮 像音乐一样轻快 像钉子一样坚硬 像鲸一样高贵

你想要成为吗

啊 你想要成为吗

啊 你想要成为吗

所有的事物

所有的都是第一次

所有的都是第一次

啊 所有的都是第一次

像阳光一样温暖 像愚蠢的也像有趣的

像树一样凉爽 像海一样可怕

像火一样热 像冰一样冷

像糖一样甜蜜 什么事物都这么美好

像时光一样老 像绳子一样长

像女王一样华丽 像蜜蜂一样嗡嗡叫

像老虎一样鬼鬼祟祟 像滑翔机一样平坦

像音乐一样纯净 像我想要成为的

啊 你想要成为吗

啊 你想要成为吗

啊 你想要成为吗

是所有的事物

所有的都是第一次
