### Close to Me歌词：

Ellie Goulding：  
Even though we both know we're liars and we start each other's fires  
We just know that we'll be alright  
Even though we're kicked out the party 'cause we both hate everybody  
We're the ones they wanna be like  
So don't let me down  
Keep me in trouble  
Born to be wild  
Out in the jungle  
Ellie Goulding/Swae Lee：  
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body  
Close to me  
And if it wasn't you  
I wouldn't want anybody
