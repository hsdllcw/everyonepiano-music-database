### Square Hammer歌词：

Living in the night  
'Neath devils torn asunder  
You call on me to solve a crooked rhyme  
As I'm closing in  
Imposing on your slumber  
You call on me as bells begin to chime  
Are you on the square  
Are you on the level  
Are you ready to swear right here right now  
Before the devil  
That you're on the square  
That you're on the level  
That you're ready to stand right here right now  
Right here right now  
Hiding from the light  
Sacrificing nothing  
Still you call on me for entrance to the shrine  
Hammering the nails  
Into a sacred coffin  
You call on me for powers clandestine  
Are you on the square  
Are you on the level  
Are you ready to swear right here right now  
Before the devil  
That you're on the square  
That you're on the level  
That you're ready to stand right here right now  
Right here right now  
Are you on the square  
Are you on the level  
Are you ready to swear right here right now  
Before the devil  
That you're on the square  
That you're on the level  
That you're ready to stand right here right now  
Right here right now  
Right here right now  
Right here right now  
Right here right now  
Right here right now
