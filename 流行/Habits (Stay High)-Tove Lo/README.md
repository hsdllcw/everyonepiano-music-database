### Habits (Stay High)歌词：

I eat my dinner in my bathtub  
Then I go to sexclubs  
Watching freaky people gettin' it on  
It doesn't make me nervous  
If anything I'm restless  
Yeah, I've been around and I've seen it all

I get home, I got the munchies  
Binge on all my Twinkies  
Throw up in the tub  
Then I go to sleep  
And I drank up all my money  
Tasted kinda lonely

You're gone and I gotta stay  
High all the time  
To keep you off my mind  
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh  
High all the time  
To keep you off my mind  
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh  
Spend my days locked in a haze  
Trying to forget you babe  
I fall back down  
Gotta stay high all my life  
To forget I'm missing you  
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Pick up daddies at the playground  
How I spend my daytime  
Loosen up the frown,  
Make them feel alive  
I'll make it fast and greasy  
I'm on my way too easy

You're gone and I gotta stay  
High all the time  
To keep you off my mind  
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh  
High all the time  
To keep you off my mind  
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh  
Spend my days locked in a haze  
Trying to forget you babe  
I fall back down  
Gotta stay high all my life  
To forget I'm missing you  
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Staying in my play pretend  
Where the fun ain't got no end  
Ooh  
Can't go home alone again  
Need someone to numb the pain  
Ooh

Staying in my play pretend  
Where the fun ain't got no end  
Ooh  
Can't go home alone again  
Need someone to numb the pain  
Ooh

You're gone and I gotta stay  
High all the time  
To keep you off my mind  
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh  
High all the time  
To keep you off my mind  
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh  
Spend my days locked in a haze  
Trying to forget you babe  
I fall back down  
Gotta stay high all my life  
To forget I'm missing you  
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
