**Style** 是美国流行女歌手Taylor Swift演唱的一首歌曲，歌曲由Ali Payami、马克斯•马丁、Shellback和泰勒•斯威夫特编写
，音乐制作由马克斯•马丁、Shellback、Ali
Payami负责。收录在泰勒•斯威夫特的第五张录音室专辑《1989》中，并作为促销专辑的第三支单曲，被发布于2015年2月10日。

《 _Style_ 》是一首感性的流行放克（funk-
pop）歌曲。在这首歌中，泰勒•斯威夫特的歌声带有浪漫的气息，甚至还有性感，歌曲歌词给人一种熟悉的情感，这是泰勒•斯威夫特从未有过的风格，显然带有80年代末的音乐氛围。它就像一部80年代、父母那一辈常看的老电影，带领听者闪回至某个放纵享乐的夜晚
。

从电吉他轻扫的和弦、再到合成器流畅的鼓点，这首歌让乐迷们听到了焕然一新的泰勒•斯威夫特；相比于泰勒之前的作品，《Style》在歌词上更有“暗示性”，甚至说“性暗示”。泰勒在歌曲中继续展现了她个人的创作才华，当“Take
me home”的桥段响起时，放纵整晚的她忽然困意来袭，并温存地让男孩带她回家。

### Style歌词：

Midnight,  
You come and pick me up, no headlights  
A long drive,  
Could end in burning flames or paradise  
Fade into view, oh, it's been a while since I have even heard from you (heard
from you)

I should just tell you to leave 'cause I  
Know exactly where it leads but I  
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye  
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like  
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time  
'Cause we never go out of style  
We never go out of style

You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt  
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt  
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time  
'Cause we never go out of style  
We never go out of style.

So it goes  
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road  
Takes me home  
Lights are off, he's taking off his coat, hmm, yeah.  
I say, "I heard, oh, that you've been out and about with some other girl, some
other girl."

He says, "What you've heard is true but I  
Can't stop thinking about you," and I...  
I said, "I've been there, too, a few times."

'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye  
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like  
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time  
'Cause we never go out of style  
We never go out of style

You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt  
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (tight little skirt)  
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time  
'Cause we never go out of style  
We never go out of style

Take me home  
Just take me home, yeah.  
Just take me home  
(out of style)

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye  
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like  
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time  
'Cause we never go out of style  
We never go out of style
