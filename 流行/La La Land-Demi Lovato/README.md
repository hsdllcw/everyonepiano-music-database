**La La Land** 出自于美国青年歌手Demi Lovato 2008年9月23日发行的个人首张录音室专辑，是该专辑的第二支单曲。

《 _La La Land_ 》是一首Pop Rock风格的单曲，歌曲MV于2008年12月19日发行。这首二单讲述了“Don't let others
change who you are.”以及“Be
yourself.”的意义。歌曲MV中展现了好莱坞明星们为名声而放弃真我，而Demi确是其中特立独行不为名声而改变自我的一人，MV更是邀请到Demi在Sonny
With A Chance剧集中的众位好友参与拍摄。

来自BBC Music(British Broadcasting Corporation)的Fraser McAlpine
给这首歌打出了4/5这样一个较高的分数，并评价说：“整体来说这首歌基调风格为Rock，但Demi的演绎让这首变得活泼，充满力量，给人一种邻家女孩儿的感觉，因此这首歌在突显Demi坚持自我的主题时才会感觉很自然。Demi在唱这首歌的时候，你几乎都能听到狗仔队按下快门儿的声音。”

### La La Land歌词：

I am confident but  
I still have my moments.  
Baby, that's just me.

I'm not a supermodel,  
[CD version:] I still eat McDonald's.  
[video version:] I still eat at Ronald's.  
Baby, that's just me.

Well, some may say I need to be afraid  
Of losing everything.  
Because of where I  
Had my start and where I made my name  
Well everything's the same  
In the la-la land machine, machine.

Who said I can't wear my converse with my dress?  
Well, baby, that's just me!

And who said I can't be single  
And have to go out and mingle  
Baby, that's not me, no, no.

Well, some may say I need to be afraid  
Of losing everything.  
Because of where I  
Had my start and where I made my name  
Well, everything's the same  
In the la-la land.

Tell me do you feel the way I feel  
'Cause nothing else is real  
In the la-la land appeal

[Guitar solo]

Some may say I need to be afraid  
Of losing everything  
Because of where I  
Had my start and where I made my name  
Well, everything's the same  
In the la-la land machine

Well, I'm not gonna change  
In the la-la land machine  
I will stay the same  
In the la-la land...

Machine  
Machine  
Machine

I won't change anything in my life  
(I won't change anything in my life)  
I'm staying myself tonight  
(I'm staying myself tonight)

La la la la la....
