### River歌词：

I've been a liar, been a thief  
我曾口吐谎言 偷掠劫窃  
Been a lover, been a cheat  
曾置身爱中 亦也有过二心  
All my sins need holy water, feel it washin' over me  
只有那汩汩圣水 才能将我的罪孽洗清  
A little one, I don't want to admit to something  
无辜的孩子啊 如果一切最终只能以苦痛收尾 【Little One指Em还未出生的孩子】  
If all it's gonna cause is pain  
多说也已无益  
Truth in my lies right now are falling like the rain  
谎言与真相交相编织 化作雨滴飞降大地  
So let the river run  
汇聚成河奔流不息  
He's coming home with his neck scratched to catch flack  
脖颈上欢爱过后留下的抓痕 深知他要遭受女友的责问  
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatch  
身着运动衫却把西装长裤穿起 是不是太匆太急穿错了衣服  
On his breast jackets is sex addict  
身上残存着浓重酒气 他嗜爱成瘾  
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back

Actually, just shit on my last chick  
毫不犹豫 我就此把前任抛弃  
And she has what my ex lacks  
她身上有着更完美的东西【Ex lacks与Ex-Lax谐音 后者为一款泻药 意味丢却抛弃】  
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath  
她就喜欢那铤而走险的感觉 而我喜欢这股狠劲  
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that  
就你那点德行还想要有人爱上你 连我都比你懂得明看得清  
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back  
而她却只是苦思冥想着该如何在他背后捅刀陷害  
Knife in hand, says the relationship's hanging by a strand  
手握利刃 说彼此的关系已悬于一线  
So she's been on the web lately  
她如蜘蛛侠穿行网里 监视着他的一举一行  
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man  
说她会对我付诸真情实意 刁难嘲讽她的男友 （Gwen Stacy此处喻指对爱情矢志不渝的象征 Spite her man与Spiderman谐音 Web双关
一指互联网 二指蜘蛛侠的蛛网）
