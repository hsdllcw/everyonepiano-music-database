### Believe歌词：

No matter how hard I try  
You keep pushing me aside  
And I can't break through  
There's no talking to you  
It's so sad that you're leavin'  
It takes time to believe it  
But after all is said and done  
You're gonna be the lonely one  
Do you believe in life after love?  
I can feel something inside me say  
I really don't think you're strong enough now  
Do you believe in life after love?

I can feel something inside me say  
I really don't think you're strong enough now  
What am I supposed to do  
Sit around and wait for you  
Well I can't do that  
And there's no turnin' back  
I need time to move on  
I need love to feel strong  
'Cos I've had time to think it through  
'N' maybe I'm too good for you  
Oh, do you believe in life after love?  
I can feel something inside me say  
I really don't think you're strong enough now  
Oh, do you believe in life after love?  
I can feel something inside me say  
I really don't think you're strong enough now  
Well I know that I'll get through this  
'Cos I know that I am strong  
I don't need you anymore  
I don't need you anymore  
No, I don't need you anymore  
I don't need you anymore  
Oh, do you believe in life after love?  
I can feel something inside me say  
I really don't think you're strong enough now  
Oh, do you believe in life after love?  
I can feel something inside me say  
I really don't think you're strong enough now  
Oh, do you believe in life after love?  
I can feel something inside me say  
I really don't think you're strong enough now  
Oh, do you believe in life after love?  
I can feel something inside me say  
I really don't think you're strong enough now
