**I Don't Know Why双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_I Don't Know Why_ 出自美国另类摇滚乐队Imagine Dragons的第三张录音室专辑。专辑于2017年6月23日发行。

乐队在坚守摇滚乐质感这方面做的十分出色，从《Radioactive》、《It's
Time》到《Believer》等等，摇滚乐的颗粒感始终处于高亮状态。最直观表现就是侧重鼓部分的运用，具体歌曲里，鼓始终都是重要的架构。格外突出“鼓”，是乐队区别于市面上其它主流摇滚乐队的特质。

### I Don't Know Why歌词：

We could be strangers in the night  
We could be passing in the shadows  
We couldn't be closer if we tried  
When we're caught in the headlights  
We could be faces in the crowd  
We could be passing in the shadows  
Loving the risk of being found  
When we're caught in the headlights  
Dangerous  
Your love is always dangerous  
And now I'm lost in us  
We're livin' in a lying trust  
I don't know why but I guess  
It's got something to do with you  
To do with you  
I don't know why but I guess  
It's got something to do with you  
To do with you  
I was a fakeing alibi  
Trading the truth in for a lie oh  
We were the essence of desire  
And were caught in the headlights  
Dangerous  
Your love is always dangerous  
And now I'm lost in us  
We're livin' in a lying trust  
I don't know why but I guess  
It's got something to do with you  
To do with you  
I don't know why but I guess  
It's got something to do with you  
To do with you I don't know why  
I don't know why but I guess  
It's got something to do with you I don't know  
To do with you I don't know why  
I don't know why but I guess  
It's got something to do with you  
To do with you  
Tell me that you love me  
Tell me that you love me  
Tell me that you love me  
Tell me that you love me  
Dangerous  
Tell me that you love me  
Tell me that you love me  
I don't know why  
I don't know why but I guess  
It's got something to do with you  
I don't know  
To do with you I don't know why  
I don't know why I don't know why  
But I guess it's got something to do with you  
Do with do with do with  
To do with you I don't know why  
I don't know why but I guess  
It's got something to do with you  
I don't know  
To do with you I don't know why  
I don't know why but I guess  
It's got something to do with you  
To do with you
