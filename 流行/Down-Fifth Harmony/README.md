### Down歌词：

[Gucci Mane:]  
It's Gucci  
Fifth Harmony  
[Lauren:]  
I need somebody with some patience  
'Cause you know I got a temperament  
And yeah, you got a reputation  
Nothin' that a little love can't fix  
There ain't no kinda situation  
Where I wouldn't cross a line for you  
FBI interrogation  
I would get up there and lie for you  
[Dinah:]  
When push come to shove  
You show me love  
When push come to shove, aye  
[Fifth Harmony:]  
Long as you're holding me down, down, down  
I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, down  
Long as you're holding me down, down, down  
I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, down  
I'm gon' keep lovin' you  
[Normani:]  
You the type that I could bake for (bake for)  
'Cause baby, you know how to take that cake  
And I'm the only one you wait for  
'Cause baby, you know that I'm worth the wait  
[Ally:]  
When push come to shove  
You show me love (you show me love)  
When push come to shove, aye  
[Fifth Harmony:]  
Long as you're holding me down, down, down  
I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, down  
Long as you're holding me down, down, down  
I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, down  
I'm gon' keep lovin' you  
[Gucci Mane:]  
It's like Bonnie and Clyde just walked in  
A gangster and his bride just walked in  
We on the same team and we ballin'  
Got me showin' off my ring like I'm Jordan  
And I'ma hold you down like you hold me  
And I'll never tell a soul what you told me  
When I was sittin' in the cells is when you showed me  
It takes a real one to put up with the old me  
That's why you in the coupe with the low seat  
That's why we at the game on the floor seats  
My diamonds that they seein' from the nosebleeds  
You make 'em mad, feel like you won a trophy  
[Fifth Harmony:]  
Long as you're holding me down, down, down  
I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, down  
Long as you're holding me down, down, down  
I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, down (love you down)  
I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, down  
Long as you're holding me down, down, down  
I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, down  
Long as you're holding me down, down, down (I'm gon' love you down)  
I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, down (long as you're lovin' me, boy)  
I'm gon' keep lovin' you
