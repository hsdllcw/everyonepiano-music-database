**Pac-Man双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Pac-Man_ 是Gorillaz与Schoolboy Q一同合作的单曲。Gorillaz，由Damon Albarn和Jamie
Hewlett共同创造的英国虚拟乐队，由主唱2-D、贝斯手Murdoc Niccals、吉他手Noodle和鼓手Russel
Hobbs四位虚拟角色组成。这是一支有趣的的说唱摇滚混搭虚拟乐队，四个成员的人物设定非常荒谬又充满创意，他们各有不同的擅长乐器与曲风以及个性作风。在他们的专辑中，人们可以听到纽约的黑人嘻哈、牙买加的雷鬼DUB、古巴的传统情歌或英伦的靡克摇滚。

### Pac-Man歌词：

Alrighty  
Let's go  
Uh ah  
You can freak me out you can throw me in the lion pit  
You can borrow my hands and tell me I'm not here  
I'm a mad Pac-Man livin' in a leveled world  
Everywhere I go I don't know where I am  
You can call me cracked you can call me mad and stifled  
You can hold my hand sail me into bathing light  
Everybody knows when I was sad I fell for you  
Everywhere I go I'm stressin' out I'm stressin' out  
I'm stressin' out I'm stressin' out stressin' out  
You can hide your head you can throw me in the lion pit  
You can borrow my days and tell me I'm not blue  
Everybody knows when I was sad I fell for you  
Everywhere I go I don't know where I am  
I'm stressin' out I'm stressin' out  
I'm stressin' out I'm stressin' out  
I'm stressin' out I'm stressin' out  
I'm stressin' out I'm stressin' out  
I'm stressin' out I'm stressin' out  
I'm stressin' out I'm stressin' out  
I'm stressin' out I'm stressin' out  
I'm stressin' out  
ScHoolboy Q：  
Uh how can I trust truth  
Uh when I ain't got nothin' to sell  
I shattered my thoughts to get out my shell  
Uh why would I hold my tongue to tuck in my tails  
Ayy can't dream if my ego is broke nah  
The jokes that try to find the answer to nope  
Uh  
My type of drive you can't buy this s**t  
You got a heart but it don't beat like this  
I had a spark then my mind went trip  
Create the wave so the vibe all mix  
2-D/ScHoolboy Q：  
I'm a mad Pac-Man  
Suu  
Livin' in a leveled world  
ScHoolboy Q：  
Yo I been at the top of the top  
Fell from the ceiling before I fail  
'Cause I needed to grow Bruce Lee royal with the glow  
Uh walked on the edge f**k tryna dream in the bed  
'Fore I die on these meds n***as gon' die on the feds  
'Fore I make it to jail prolly put one in the head  
F**k the judge and the prosecutor for hangin' me dead  
Plus thirty and still movin' I'm closer to live right  
Closer to live right  
All the trauma from past never taught me to fear heights  
Normal to fly now can't be stuck in the red lights  
Take flight the life gon' bloom for the Black Knight  
Keep a piece no Buddhist got the whole hood boomin'  
I'm like a Crip how I stewed it you on your a*s stuck stupid  
You makin' we look bad I rock the beat won't crash  
I had to fill my bag I had to hide my stash  
You know the cops' lights flash I had to clear my dash  
I represent my flag I gave the hood my last  
Every full-grown minute I had to change my image  
The brain don't got limits you think a mill' mean winnin'  
Pigs out here skinnin' your soul ain't authentic  
You died and still ain't livin'
