### Bills歌词：

I got bills I gotta pay  
So I'm gon' work, work, work every day  
I got mouths I gotta feed,  
So I'm gon' make sure everybody eats  
I got bills!

All these bills pile up my desk  
They looking like a mount (Everest!)  
All the little kids run around  
I can hear their stomachs growl (grrr!)  
It's a full moon out  
And my girl just keep on howlin' (ooh, ooh)  
She said she gonna leave me  
If I don't come home with fifty thousand (fifty thousand?)

God damn, God damn, God damn, God damn  
Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man  
God damn, oh man, God damn, oh man

I got bills I gotta pay  
So I'm gon' work, work, work every day  
I got mouths I gotta feed  
So I'm gon' make sure everybody eats  
I got bills

Woke up and I bumped my head  
Stubbed my toe on the edge of the bed  
Opened the fridge and the food all gone  
Neighbor damn dog crapped on my lawn  
Hopped in the car and the car won't start  
It's too damn hot but I still gotta walk  
Behind an old lady in the grocery line  
Praying that my card don't get declined

God damn, God damn, God damn, God damn  
Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man  
God damn, oh man, God damn, oh man

I got bills I gotta pay  
So I'm gon' work, work, work every day  
I got mouths I gotta feed  
So I'm gon' make sure everybody eats  
I got!

(Bringin' everybody trouble!)

And my shoes, my shoes  
I said my shoes!  
Ain't got no sole

I got bills I gotta pay  
So I'm gon' work, work, work every day  
I got mouths I gotta feed  
So I'm gon' make sure everybody eats

I got bills I gotta pay  
So I'm gon' work, work, work every day  
I got mouths I gotta feed  
So I'm gon' make sure everybody eats  
I got bills.

(Mama got bills! Yo' daddy got bills! Yo' sister got bills! Yo' auntie got
bills!)  
I got bills.  
(Yo' Uncle got bills! Everybody got bills! Everybody got bills!)
