### All Falls Down歌词：

What's the trick I wish I knew  
I'm so done with thinking through  
All the things I could've been  
And I know you wonder too  
All it takes is that one look you do  
And I run right back to you  
U crossed the line  
& it's time to say F u  
What's the point in saying that  
When u know how I'll react  
U think u can just take it back  
But sh*t just don't work like that  
You're the drug that I'm addicted to  
And I want you so bad  
Guess I'm stuck with you  
And that's that  
Cus when it all falls down then whatever  
When it don't work out for the better  
If we just ain't right and it's time to say goodbye  
When it all falls down  
When it all falls down  
I'll be fine  
I'll be fine  
You're the drug that I'm addicted to  
And I want you so bad  
But I'll be fine  
Why we fight I don't know  
We say what hurts the most  
Oh I try staying cold  
But you take it personal  
All this firing shots  
And making grounder  
It's way too hard to cope  
But I still can't let you go go go  
Cus when it all falls down then whatever  
When it don't work out for the better  
If we just ain't right and it's time to say goodbye  
When it all falls down  
When it all falls down  
I'll be fine  
I'll be fine  
You're the drug that I'm addicted to  
And I want you so bad  
But I'll be fine  
I'll be fine  
I'll be fine  
I'll be fine  
Falling down  
I'll be fine  
I'll be fine  
I'll be fine fine fine  
I'll be fine  
I'll be fine  
I'll be fine  
Falling down  
I'll be fine  
I'll be fine  
I'll be fine  
Cus when it all falls down then whatever  
When it don't work out for the better  
If we just ain't right and it's time to say goodbye  
When it all falls down  
When it all falls down  
I'll be fine  
Fine fine fine  
I'll be fine  
I'll be fine  
You're the drug that I'm addicted to  
And I want you so bad  
But I'll be fine  
I'll be fine  
And that's that
