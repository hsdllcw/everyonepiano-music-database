**I Lived** 是OneRepublic演唱的一首歌曲，收录在OneRepublic发行的专辑《Native》中，于2014年8月5日发行。  
  
Native处处充满多样融合与对比的创意：在销售所得捐给关怀儿童权利组织「Save The Children」的单曲"Feel
Again"中邀请危地马拉的孩童参与合唱，细腻揉合了福音风格的旋律，流露着手打拍子般整齐划一的和声，书写着关于救赎的歌词，是一首震撼心弦的作品；在碰触黑暗主题的歌曲"If
I Lose
Myself"中，乐团藉由宏伟的音乐氛围来堆砌情感的动能，同时也选择以耀眼夺目的舞曲节奏来掩护较为忧郁的歌曲主题。专辑中多首满载着快乐能量的歌曲也各具特色，像是创作灵感源自于披头士名曲"Hey
Jude"的"Something I Need"拥有激起乐迷齐声高唱的副歌段落，至于"Life In
Color"则是透过飞驰快感的鼓击节拍与暖色调的合成器音色与Ryan
Tedder宽广的唱腔来酝酿情境。Ryan表示Native是一张非常摩登的专辑，是一张2013年的生活快照，专辑中的歌曲有关生死、爱、希望、绝望、信念、失败，包含了所有的人类情感，试着在没有说教色彩的情况下为歌词增添一点份量，做出一种能够与人们产生链接的音乐。

### I Lived歌词：

Hoping you take that jump  
But don't fear the fall  
Hope when the water rises  
You built a wall  
Hoping the crowd screams out  
Screaming your name  
Hope if everybody runs  
You chose to stay  
Hope that you fall in love  
And it hurts so bad  
The only way you can know  
Is give it all you have  
And I hope that you don't suffer  
But take the pain  
Hope when the moment comes  
You say......  
I, I did it all  
I, I did it all  
I owned every second  
That this world could give  
I saw so many places  
And things that I did  
Of every broken bone  
I swear I lived  
Hope that you spend your days  
But they all add up  
And when that sun goes down  
Hope you raise your cup  
I wish that I could witness  
All you drawed  
And all your pain  
But until my moment comes  
I'll say...  
I, I did it all  
I, I did it all  
I owned every second  
That this world could give  
I saw so many places  
And things that I did  
Of every broken bone  
I swear I lived  
Woah  
Woah  
Woah  
Oh  
Oh  
Of every broken bone  
I swear I lived  
Of every broken bone  
I swear I lived  
I, I did it all  
I, I did it all  
I owned every second  
That this world could give  
I saw so many places  
And things that I did  
Of every broken bone  
I swear I lived  
Woah  
Woah  
I swear I lived  
Woah  
Oh  
Oh
