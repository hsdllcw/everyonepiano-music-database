### OK Not To Be OK歌词：

Feeling like a drop in the ocean  
That don't nobody notice  
Maybe it's all just in your head  
Feeling like you're trapped in your own skin  
And now your body's frozen  
Broken down you've got nothing left  
When you're high on emotion  
And you're losing your focus  
And you feel too exhausted to pray  
Don't get lost in the moment  
Or give up when you're closest  
All you need is somebody to say  
It's okay not to be okay  
It's okay not to be okay  
When you're down and you feel ashamed  
It's okay not to be okay  
Feeling like your life's an illusion  
And lately you're secluded  
Thinking you'll never get your chancе  
Feeling like you got no solution  
It's only 'cause you're human  
No control it's out of your hands  
When you're high on emotion  
And you're losing your focus  
And you feel too exhausted to pray  
Don't get lost in the moment  
Or give up when you're closest  
All you need is somebody to say  
It's okay not to be okay  
It's okay not to be okay  
When you're down and you feel ashamed  
It's okay not to be okay  
When you're high on emotion  
And you're losing your focus  
And you feel too exhausted to pray  
Aah  
Don't get lost in the moment  
Or give up when you're closest  
All you need is somebody to say  
It's okay not to be okay  
Ooh  
It's okay not to be okay  
No no no  
When you're down and you feel ashamed  
When you feel ashamed  
It's okay not to be okay  
No no no  
It's okay not to be okay
