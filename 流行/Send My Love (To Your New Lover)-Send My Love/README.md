**Send My Love (To Your New Lover)** 是英国流行歌手Adele演唱的一首歌，是其2015新专辑《25》中的第2首。

在实体唱片几乎已经被淘汰的时代，阿黛尔这张专辑销量的逆生长，对整个音乐产业来讲，其实只是一个特例，而没有任何能够复制的可能性。在一个缺乏超级巨星的时代，阿黛尔以唱功、歌曲、演唱等几大纯音乐的元素而赢得听众。尤其是将个人的情绪，唱出一种大歌的效果，而这种雅俗共赏的大气，恰恰是这个崇尚个性却缺乏共性的时代最为缺少的音乐气质。另一方面，阿黛尔虽然年轻，但她主打的并不是年轻人的市场。

### Send My Love (To Your New Lover)歌词：

Just the guitar, okay cool

This was all you, none of it me  
You put your hands on, on my body and told me  
You told me you were ready  
For the big one, for the big jump  
I'd be your last love everlasting you and me  
That was what you told me

I'm giving you up  
I've forgiven it all  
You set me free, oh

Send my love to your new lover  
Treat her better  
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts  
We both know we ain't kids no more  
Send my love to your new lover  
Treat her better  
We gotta let go of all of our ghosts  
We both know we ain't kids no more

I was too strong you were trembling  
You couldn't handle the hot heat rising (rising)  
Baby I'm so rising  
I was running, you were walking  
You couldn't keep up, you were falling down (down)  
Mmm there's only one way down

I'm giving you up  
I've forgiven it all  
You set me free-ee

Send my love to your new lover  
Treat her better  
We gotta let go of all of our ghosts  
We both know we ain't kids no more  
Send my love to your new lover  
Treat her better  
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts  
We both know we ain't kids no more

If you're ready, if you're ready  
If you're ready, I am ready  
If you're ready, if you're ready  
We both know we ain't kids no more  
No, we ain't kids no more

I'm giving you up  
I've forgiven it all  
You set me free-ee

Send my love to your new lover  
Treat her better  
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts  
We both know we ain't kids no more  
Send my love to your new lover  
Treat her better  
We gotta let go of all of our ghosts  
We both know we ain't kids no more

If you're ready, if you're ready (Send my love to your new lover)  
If you're ready, are you ready? (Treat her better)  
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts  
We both know we ain't kids no more  
If you're ready, if you're ready (Send my love to your new lover)  
If you're ready, are you ready? (Treat her better)  
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts  
We both know we ain't kids no more
