**Why双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Why_ 是由加拿大流行男歌手Shawn Mendes录唱的一首歌曲。该歌曲被收录在Shawn Mendes的同名录音室专辑《Shawn
Mendes》，为专辑中的第八首歌曲。

小编觉得这首歌应该是写给卡妹的，记得在一个采访里Shawn说过「She’s my favorite person in the whole
world」（卡妹是我这个世界上最喜欢的人），而卡妹回应「I shouldn't be crying at this time in the morning
but I AM」（我今天早上这时候不该哭的，但我哭了），可见他们之间的友谊真的令人羡慕。

### Why歌词：

I know a girl she's like a curse  
We want each other no one will break first  
So many nights trying to find someone new  
They don't mean nothing compared to her and I know  
When people ask about us now we just brush it off  
I don't know why we act like it means nothing at all  
I wish that I could tell you that you're all that I want yeah  
I pretend that I'm not ready  
Why do we put each other through hell  
Why can't we just get over ourselves  
And you say hi like you just met me  
Why do we put each other through hell  
Why can't we just get over ourselves  
Why can't we just get over ourselves  
When I hear you sing it gets hard to breathe  
Can't help but think every song's about me  
And every line every word that I write  
You are the muse in the back of my mind oh  
Don't want to ask about it 'cause you might brush it off  
I'm afraid you think that it means nothing at all  
I don't know why I won't admit that you're all I want  
I pretend that I'm not ready  
Why do we put each other through hell  
Why can't we just get over ourselves  
And you say hi like you just met me  
Why do we put each other through hell  
Why can't we just get over ourselves  
I pretend that I'm not ready  
Why do we put each other through hell  
Why can't we just get over ourselves  
And you say hi like you just met me  
Why do we put each other through hell  
Why can't we just get over ourselves  
I know a girl she's like a curse  
We want each other no one will break first  
So many nights trying to find someone new  
They don't mean nothing compared to you
