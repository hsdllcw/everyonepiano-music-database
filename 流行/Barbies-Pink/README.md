### Barbies歌词：

Another day another sin  
Another day I'm late again  
Oh just like that my money's spent  
Where did it all go  
Another night another heart  
Another one leaves in the dark  
And I'm searching for my counterpart  
Where did they all go  
And I lock every single door  
And I look behind me even more  
Now I've turned into someone that I swore  
I would never be  
I wish I could go back to playing Barbies in my room  
They never say that you gotta grow up quite this soon  
How fast things change and now I'm here  
And all I wanna do  
Is go back to playing Barbies in my room  
I see it on my father's face  
Another line that comes with age  
I know that time will have its way  
Where did it all go  
They say that things were simple then  
Although I don't remember when  
I wanna know what happens next  
Where do we all go  
And I lock every single door  
And I look behind me even more  
Now I've turned into someone that I swore I would never be  
I wish I could go back to playing Barbies in my room  
They never say that you gotta grow up quite this soon  
How fast things change and now I'm here  
And all I wanna do  
Is go back to playing Barbies in my room  
Pink canopies and grass-stained knees  
Putting fireflies in a jar  
Getting home before it's dark  
Scotch-taping posters on my wall  
Rolling pixie sticks to smoke  
Couldn't wait till I was older  
And I wish I could go back to playing Barbies in my room  
They never say that you gotta grow up quite this soon  
How fast things change and now I'm here  
And all I wanna do  
Is go back to playing Barbies in my room  
Back to playing Barbies  
I wish that I could go back  
I wish that I could go back  
I wish that I could go back  
Back to playing Barbies in my room
