### Bumpin' the Night歌词：

The week was long  
But now it's gone, the drink is gone  
So fill your cup and turn the good time music up  
Pick up that swing, somebody wrap your arms around it's friday night  
Get a little lost in the party  
Flow your trouble like a champagne bubble, saying  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Two bottles of Bud  
Two speakers in the trunk  
Two people in love  
Just bumpin' the night  
Two crazy hearts  
Looking in the dark for a place to park it to their life  
Find an old school way-and-bee  
And put a little shine on the bottle seat  
Two bottles of Bud  
Two speakers in the trunk  
Two people in love  
Just bumpin' the night  
The night is young  
The night is free  
And so are we  
So let it out  
And let me stay inside your drink  
Lipstick all along  
Next sipping star lie on the windoe tripping down  
Off in the distance the lights of town  
Can you see it now?  
Two bottles of Bud  
Two speakers in the trunk  
Two people in love  
Just bumpin' the night  
Two crazy hearts  
Looking in the dark for a place to park it to their life  
Find an old school way-and-bee  
And put a little shine on the bottle seat  
Two bottles of Bud  
Two speakers in the trunk  
Two people in love  
Just bumpin' the night  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Two bottles of Bud  
Two speakers in the trunk  
Two people in love  
Just bumpin' the night  
Two crazy hearts  
Looking in the dark for a place to park it to their life  
Find an old school way-and-bee  
And put a little shine on the bottle seat  
Two bottles of Bud  
Two speakers in the trunk  
Two people in love  
Just bumpin' the night  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Just bumpin' the night  
Two bottles of Bud  
Two speakers in the trunk  
Two people in love  
Just bumpin' the night
