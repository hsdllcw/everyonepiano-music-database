**Underdog双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Underdog_ 是15次格莱美获奖琴韵天后Alicia
Keys为努力打拼的人发声的2020年首发单曲。此曲开头有那种在一片空旷的地方才能够唱出来的那种音调，整首歌也很有渲染力。但真正有渲染力的是歌词，歌词里写出了各种行业的人的平常生活经历感悟。所以我们不能做生活的失败者，我们要对每一天充满希望。

### Underdog歌词：

Ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh  
She was walking in the street looked up and noticed  
He was nameless he was homeless  
She asked him his name and told him what hers was  
He gave her a story 'bout life  
With a glint in his eye and a corner of a smile  
One conversation a simple moment  
The things that change us if we notice  
When we look up sometimes  
They said I would never make it  
But I was built to break the mold  
The only dream that I've been chasing is my own  
So I sing a song for the hustlers trading at the bus stop  
Single mothers waiting on a check to come  
Young teachers student doctors  
Sons on the front line knowing they don't get to run  
This goes out to the underdog  
Keep on keeping at what you love  
You'll find that someday soon enough  
You will rise up rise up yeah  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh  
She's riding in a taxi back to the kitchen  
Talking to the driver 'bout his wife and his children  
On the run from a country where they put you in prison  
For being a woman and speaking your mind  
She looked in his eyes in the mirror and he smiled  
One conversation a simple momenth  
The things that change us if we notice  
When we look up sometimes  
They said I would never make it  
But I was built to break the mold  
The only dream that I've been chasing is my own  
So I sing a song for the hustlers trading at the bus stop  
Single mothers waiting on a check to come  
Young teachers student doctors  
Sons on the front line knowing they don't get to run  
This goes out to the underdog  
Keep on keeping at what you love  
You'll find that someday soon enough  
You will rise up rise up yeah  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Everybody rise up  
You gonna rise up ayy  
So I sing a song for the hustlers trading at the bus stop  
Single mothers waiting on a check to come  
Single mothers  
Young teachers student doctors  
Yeah  
Sons on the front line knowing they don't get to run  
This goes out to the underdog  
Keep on keeping at what you love  
You'll find that someday soon enough  
You will rise up rise up yeah  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh
