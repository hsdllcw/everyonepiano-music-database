### Under The Bridge歌词：

Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner  
Sometimes I feel like my only friend  
Is the city I live in  
The city of angels  
Lonely as I am  
together we cry  
I drive on her streets  
'Cause she's my companion  
I walk through her hills  
'Cause She knows who I am  
She sees my good deeds  
And she kisses me windy  
I never worry  
Now that is a lie  
I don't ever want to feel  
Like I did that day  
Take me to the place I love  
Take me all the way  
It's hard to believe  
That there's nobody out there  
It's hard to believe  
That I'm all alone  
At least I have her love  
The city she loves me
