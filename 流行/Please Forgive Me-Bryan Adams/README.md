Please Forgive Me歌词：

  
Still feels like our first night together,  
Feels like the first kiss,  
It's getting' better. Baby,  
no one can better this.  
Still holdin' on, you're still the one.  
First time our eyes met,  
Same feelin' I get,  
Only feels much stronger,  
Wanna love you longer.  
You still turn the fire on.  
So if you're feelin' lonely, don't,  
So if you're feelin' lonely, don't,  
You're the only one I ever want.  
You're the only one I ever want.  
I only wanna make it good,  
I only wanna make it good,  
So if I love you a little more than I should  
So if I love you a little more than I should  
Please forgive me,  
Please forgive me,  
I know not what I do,  
I know not what I do,  
Please forgive me,  
Please forgive me,  
I can't stop lovin' you.  
I can't stop lovin' you.  
Don't deny me,  
Don't deny me,  
this pain I'm goin' through,  
this pain I'm goin' through,  
Please forgive me,  
Please forgive me,  
if I need you like I do.  
if I need you like I do.  
I believe that  
Please believe me ,  
every word I say is true,  
every word I say is true,  
Please forgive me,  
Please forgive me,  
I can't stop lovin' you.  
I can't stop lovin' you.  
Still feels like our best times are together,  
Feels like the first touch,  
Still getting' closer, baby,  
can't get close enough,  
Still holdin' on, still number one.  
I remember the smell of your skin,  
I remember everything,  
I remember all your moves,  
I remember you.  
I remember the nights,  
ya know I still do.  
CHORUS  
One thing I'm sure of  
Is the way we make love  
And one thing I depend on  
Is for us to stay strong.  
With every word and every breath I'm prayin',  
That's why I'm sayin'  
Please forgive me, I know not what I do,  
Please forgive me, I can't stop lovin' you.  
Don't deny me, this pain I'm goin' through,  
Please forgive me if I need you like I do.  
Babe, believe me every word I say is true,  
Please forgive me if I can't stop lovin' you.  
Never leave me, I don't know what I'd do,  
Please forgive me, I can't stop lovin' you.  
Can't stop lovin' you.
