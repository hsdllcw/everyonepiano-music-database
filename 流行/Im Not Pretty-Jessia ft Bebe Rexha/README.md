### I'm Not Pretty歌词：

Maybe I'm not pretty maybe I'm just fun  
'Cause I got a belly and I got a bum  
And I'm always jelly of all the other ones  
With their itty bitty bellies and their rump-ump-ump-ums  
I know that I should love myself  
But it's getting kinda hard when you're constantly feeling like garbage  
Know I shouldn't hurt myself  
But I can't find a way to lose weight without literally starving  
Every other song says I'm beautiful  
But what if I don't feel like I'm beautiful  
I wish my body image didn't say  
That I should be another kinda way  
Maybe I'm not pretty maybe I'm just fun  
'Cause I got a belly and I got a bum  
But I can't be jelly of all the other ones  
So I'm falling in lovе with my rump-ump-ump-um  
I'm not gonna ask for help  
'Cause all you're gonna say is  
&quot;You'rе perfect and oh you're so worth it&quot;  
Sometimes I hate myself  
I get inside my head and I think that I somehow deserve this  
Every other song says I'm beautiful  
But what if I don't feel like I'm beautiful  
I wish my body image didn't say  
That I should be another kinda way  
Maybe I'm not pretty maybe I'm just fun  
'Cause I got a belly and I got a bum  
But I can't be jelly of all the other ones  
So I'm falling in love with my rump-ump-ump-um  
Maybe I'm not pretty maybe I'm just fun  
'Cause I got a belly and I got a bum  
But I can't be jelly of all the other ones  
So I'm falling in love with my rump-ump-ump-um  
I'm not pretty  
I'm not pretty  
So I'm falling in love with my rump-ump-ump-um
