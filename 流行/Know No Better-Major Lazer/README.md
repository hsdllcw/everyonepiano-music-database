### Know No Better歌词：

[Travis Scott:]  
Yeah  
Straight up  
Wrist look like it been dipped  
Dipped in that, dipped in that, dipped in that  
Script look like it been flipped  
Flippin' that, flippin' that, flippin' that  
Pull up in that foreign, my God  
Whole squad get in that, get in that  
Please say it ain't true  
I had to go and cop two  
Hell nah, we can't fit in that  
Wild ones, like we fresh out the cage  
Showtime baby, fresh out the stage  
Bad lil' mama, fresh off the page  
Front like you love it, but you know that you hate it  
Yeah you know no better  
Yeah you know no better  
Yeah you know no better, ooh  
[Camila Cabello (Travis Scott):]  
Yeah, you know no better  
Say you different, who you kidding?  
Yeah, you know no better  
Ooh, save that talk for the ones who don't know no better  
'Cause baby I know you better  
('Cause baby I know no better)  
Baby I know you better (baby I know)  
Baby I know you better  
Baby I know you better (straight up)  
Baby I know you better  
(Baby I know, I know no better)  
[Travis Scott:]  
Top dropped off on my whip  
Wippin' that, wippin' that, wippin' that  
Yellow and that purple on mix  
Mixin' that, mixin' that, mixin' that  
Copped my bitch from the tropics (yeah)  
You know where she sitting at  
Taking shots, pouring bottle after bottle after bottle  
Hell nah, we ain't sipping that  
Wild ones, like we fresh out the cage  
Showtime baby, fresh out the stage  
Bad lil' mama, fresh off the page  
Front like you love it, but you know that you hate it  
Yeah you know no better  
Yeah you know no better  
Yeah you know no better, ooh  
[Camila Cabello (Travis Scott):]  
Yeah, you know no better  
Say you different, who you kidding?  
Yeah, you know no better  
Ooh, save that talk for the ones who don't know no better  
'Cause baby I know you better  
(Cause baby I know no better)  
Baby I know you better (baby I know)  
Baby I know you better  
Baby I know you better  
Baby I know you better  
(Baby I know, I know no better)  
[Quavo:]  
Quavo!  
Drop top on the whip (drop top)  
Dab of ranch on the chips (dab)  
Ice cream gave her chills (ice cream)  
Too much cash pay the bills  
I make her ride Mercedes (skrr skrr)  
I can afford the latest (yeah)  
Baby ignore the ratings (ignore 'em)  
Cause pull up, we pump up, we raging  
We know no better (no)  
Stack my bread up (stack)  
Don't get fed up (nope)  
Ain't gonna let up (yeah)  
You told me to shut up (shut up)  
But I'ma do better (huh?)  
It's not my race (woo!)  
Get out my face (get out)  
Drop my case (drop it)  
Which way? (where?)  
That way  
[Camila Cabello (Travis Scott):]  
Yeah, you know no better  
Say you different, who you kidding?  
Yeah, you know no better  
Ooh, save that talk for the ones who don't know no better  
'Cause baby I know you better  
Baby I know you better (straight up)  
Baby I know you better  
Baby I know you better  
Baby I know you better  
(Baby I know, I know no better)
