### Bless the Broken Road英文歌词：

I set out on a narrow way many years ago .  
Hoping I would find true love along the broken road .  
But I got lost a time or two.  
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through  
I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you.  
Every long lost dream,  
lead me to where you are.  
Others who broke my heart ,  
they were like northern stars.  
Pointing me on my way,  
into your loving arms.  
This much I know is true.  
That God blessed the broken road .  
That led me straight to you.  
I think about the years I spent just passing through.  
I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you.  
But you just smile and take my hand.  
You've been there you understand.  
It's all part of a grander plan that is coming true .  
Every long lost dream,  
lead me to where you are .  
Others who broke my heart ,  
they were like northern stars.  
Pointing me on my way ,  
into your loving arms .  
This much I know is true .  
That God blessed the broken road.  
That led me straight to you.  
Now I'm just rollin' home  
into my lover's arms.  
This much I know is true.  
That God blessed the broken road.  
That led me straight to you.  
That God blessed the broken road.  
That led me straight to you.

### Bless the Broken Road中文歌词：

多年前我从一条狭窄的路上启程  
希望能在这坎坷的路途中发现真爱  
可我一而再地迷失  
擦干额头，继续前行  
却找不到通向你的路  
每一个久违的梦境  
都指引着你的所在  
那些让我心碎的人  
他们也好像是北极星  
指出了通向你怀抱的那条路  
我知道这一切多么真实  
上帝保佑着我这坎坷的旅程  
让我找到了你  
我回想着那些逝去的时光  
我想曾经逝去的时光  
以后会和你共同度过  
你笑着牵起我的手  
此刻你就在这里  
感受着我的心  
这就是我全部的梦  
如今成真了  
（最后一段副歌）  
现在我正和我的爱人携手  
走在回家的路途中  
我知道这一切是多么的真实  
上帝保佑着我这坎坷的旅程  
让我找到了你
