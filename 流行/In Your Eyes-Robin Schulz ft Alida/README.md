### In Your Eyes歌词：

Hearing whispers in the night  
Voices filling up your mind  
You're like a ghost of you  
You've been drowning in the rain  
Slowly saving up the pain  
So deep inside of you  
See the colors of the sky  
Slowly turn from black and white  
A rising hope bright as gold  
Now there's nothing left to lose  
So we're breaking all the rules  
And they don't know what we know  
'Cause I can hear  
The thunder from afar  
A lightening in the dark  
I can feel the fire come alive  
So calm before the storm  
So dark before the dawn  
Oh I can see the fire in your eyes  
In your eyes  
Oh I can see the fire in your eyes  
In your eyes  
Oh I can see the fire in your eyes  
Oh I can see the fire in your eyes  
Now you'll never be the same  
Once you've felt that burning flame  
You're chasing stars alive  
What was broken's left behind  
Watch it crumble in the light  
Nothing can stop you now  
See the colours of the sky  
Slowing turn from black and white  
A rising hope bright as gold  
Now there's nothing left to lose  
So we're breaking all the rules  
And they don't know what we know whoa  
'Cause I can hear  
The thunder from afar  
A lightening in the dark  
I can feel the fire come alive  
So calm before the storm  
So dark before the dawn  
Oh I can see the fire in your eyes  
In your eyes  
Oh I can see the fire in your eyes  
In your eyes  
Oh I can see the fire in your eyes  
Oh I can see the fire in your eyes  
Oh I can see the fire in your eyes  
In your eyes  
Oh I can see the fire in your eyes  
In your eyes  
Oh I can see the fire in your eyes
