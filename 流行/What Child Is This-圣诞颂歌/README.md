### What Child Is This歌词：

What child is this, who, laid to rest  
On Mary's lap is sleeping?  
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet  
While shepherds watch are keeping?  
This, this is Christ the King  
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing;  
Haste, haste to bring Him laud  
The babe, the son of Mary  
Why lies He in such mean estate  
Where ox and ass are feeding?  
Good Christian, fear, for sinners here  
The silent Word is pleading  
This, this is Christ the King  
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing;  
Haste, haste to bring Him laud  
The babe, the son of Mary  
So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh  
Come, peasant, King, to own Him;  
The King of kings salvation brings  
Let loving hearts enthrone Him  
This, this is Christ the King  
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing;  
Haste, haste to bring Him laud  
The babe, the son of Mary
