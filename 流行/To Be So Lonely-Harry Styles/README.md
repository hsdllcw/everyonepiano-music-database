### To Be So Lonely歌词：

Don't blame me for falling  
I was just a little boy  
Don't blame the drunk calling  
Wasn't ready for it all  
You can't blame me darling  
Not even a little bit  
I was away  
I'm just an arrogant son of a b***h who can't admit when he's sorry  
Don't call me baby again you've got your reasons  
Know that you're trying to be friends know you mean it  
Don't call me baby again it's hard for me to go home  
Be so lonely  
I just hope you see me in a little better light  
Do you think it's easy being of the jealous kind  
'Cause I miss the shape of your lips  
Your wit it's just a trick  
This is it so I'm sorry  
Don't call me baby again you've got your reasons  
Know that you're trying to be friends know you mean it  
Don't call me baby again it's hard for me to go home  
Be so lonely  
To be so lonely to be so  
To be so lonely  
To be so lonely to be so  
To be so lonely  
And I'm just an arrogant son of a b***h  
Who can't admit when he's sorry  
Don't call me baby again you've got your reasons  
Know that you're trying to be friends I know you mean it  
Don't call me baby again it's hard for me to go home  
Be so lonely  
To be so lonely to be so  
To be so lonely  
To be so lonely to be so  
To be so lonely
