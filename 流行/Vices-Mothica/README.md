### Vices歌词：

Feel like I'm just passing by  
It's not love it's just a guy  
And it's got me feeling right for the night but  
In the morning when he's gone  
I'm alone with all my thoughts  
So I gotta drink 'em up 'til I'm numb  
And  
Ooh  
It's never enough, pass me the cup  
Got nowhere to run, so pour me another one  
I'm taking it all  
I'm getting lost  
I'm making a fool of myself  
With all these  
Vices  
I really don't know why I'm like this  
And I just don't care what the price is  
'Cause I need these vices (oh)  
If it's not drugs it's drinks  
If it's not drinks it's things  
If it's not things it's people  
Places I don't wanna be  
These vices  
Is it okay I'm not okay?  
I don't sleep too much these days  
And I hate being awake when the sun's out  
Lock my door and shut the blinds  
They can't see my bloodshot eyes  
I got habits I can't hide in the light and  
Ooh  
It's never enough, pass me the cup  
Got nowhere to run, so pour me another one  
I'm taking it all  
I'm getting lost  
I'm making a fool of myself  
With all these  
Vices  
I really don't know why I'm like this  
And I just don't care what the price is  
'Cause I need these vices (oh)  
If it's not drugs it's drinks  
If it's not drinks it's things  
If it's not things it's people, places I don't wanna be  
These vices  
And I just don't care what the price is  
I'm tryna fill up the silence  
With all  
These vices (oh)  
Burning through a cigarette  
Got somebody in my bed  
But I'm still just in my head, in my head and  
All the signs are turning red  
And I'm starting to regret, and I'm starting to regret  
To regret these  
Vices  
I really don't know why I'm like this  
And I just don't care what the price is  
'Cause I need these vices (oh)  
If it's not drugs it's drinks  
If it's not drinks it's things  
If it's not things it's people, places I don't wanna be  
These vices  
And I just don't care what the price is  
I'm tryna fill up the silence with all  
These vices (oh)
