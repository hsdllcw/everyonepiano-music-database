### (I Just) Died in Your Arms歌词：

Oh I I just died in your arms tonight  
It must have been something you said  
I just died in your arms tonight  
I keep looking for something I can't get  
Broken hearts they're all around me  
And I don't see an easier way to get out of this  
Her diary sits by the bedside table  
The curtains are closed the cats in the cradle  
Who would have thought that a boy like me could come to this  
Oh I I just died in your arms tonight  
It must have been something you said  
I just died in your arms tonight  
Oh I I just died in your arms tonight  
It must have been some kind of kiss  
I should have walked away  
I should have walked away  
Is there any just cause for feeling like this  
On the surface I'm a name on a list  
I try to be discreet but then blow it again  
I've lost and found it's my final mistake  
She's loving by proxy no give and all take  
'Cause I've been thrilled to fantasy one too many times  
Oh I I just died in your arms tonight  
It must have been something you said  
I just died in your arms tonight  
Oh I I just died in your arms tonight  
It must have been some kind of kiss  
I should have walked away  
I should have walked away  
It was a long hot night she made it easy  
She made it feel right  
But now it's over the moment has gone  
I followed my hands to my head I know I was wrong  
Oh I I just died in your arms tonight  
It must have been something you said  
I just died in your arms tonight  
Oh I I just died in your arms tonight  
It must have been some kind of kiss  
I should have walked away  
I should have walked away
