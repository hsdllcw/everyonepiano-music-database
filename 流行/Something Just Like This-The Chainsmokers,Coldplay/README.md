### Something Just Like This歌词：

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]  
I've been reading books of old  
The legends and the myths  
Achilles and his gold  
Hercules and his gifts  
Spiderman's control  
And Batman with his fists  
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]  
She said "Where'd you wanna go?  
How much you wanna risk?  
I'm not looking for somebody  
With some superhuman gifts  
Some superhero  
Some fairytale bliss  
Just something I can turn to  
Somebody I can kiss"

[Bridge: Chris Martin]  
"I want something just like this  
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo  
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo  
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo  
Oh I want something just like this  
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo  
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo  
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo"

[Chorus: Chris Martin]  
"Oh I want something just like this  
I want something just like this"

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]  
I've been reading books of old  
The legends and the myths  
The testaments they told  
The moon and its eclipse  
And Superman unrolls  
A suit before he lifts  
But I'm not the kind of person that it fits

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]  
She said "Where'd you wanna go?  
How much you wanna risk?  
I'm not looking for somebody  
With some superhuman gifts  
Some superhero  
Some fairytale bliss  
Just something I can turn to  
Somebody I can miss"

[Chorus: Chris Martin]  
"I want something just like this  
I want something just like this"

[Bridge: Chris Martin]  
"Oh I want something just like this  
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo  
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo  
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo  
Oh I want something just like this  
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo  
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo  
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo"

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]  
"Where d'ya wanna go?  
How much you wanna risk?  
I'm not looking for somebody  
With some superhuman gifts  
Some superhero  
Some fairytale bliss  
Just something I can turn to  
Somebody I can kiss  
I want something just like this"

[Chorus: Chris Martin]  
"Oh I want something just like this  
Oh I want something just like this  
Oh I want something just like this  
Oh I want something just like this"
