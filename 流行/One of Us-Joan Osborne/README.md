**One of Us** 是歌手Joan Osborne的首张专辑《Relish》中的经典之作。

  
女歌手Joan Osborne经由水星公司推出了自己的首张专辑《Relish》，其中的单曲"One of
Us"不仅传遍全球也为她赢得了歌迷的喜爱。同时这张布鲁斯风格的专辑还给她带来了五项格莱美奖提名，其中最佳新人的提名具有格外重大的意义。此后的两年中，Osborne为推广《Relish》而走遍世界，其间她也经历了"
_One of Us_ "和"St. Teresa"所带来的宗教纠纷。一切结束后，Osborne再次重返录音棚开始制作下张专辑《Righteous
Love》，由于没有唱片公司的资助，她自掏腰包创作并录制新歌，也正是因为这个原因，新专辑包含了从东方风情、宗教风格到纯粹的布鲁斯等众多音乐形式。

### One of Us歌词：

If God had a name, what would it be?  
如果上帝有个名字那会是什么？  
And would you call it to His face  
你会直呼其名么？  
If you were faced with Him in all His glory?  
如果他就在你面前  
What would you ask if you had just one question?  
在他的光辉历程中  
哪个是你要提起的？  
Yeah, yeah, God is Great  
没错,没错,上帝是伟大的~``  
Yeah, yeah, God is Good  
没错,没错,上帝是美好的..  
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah  
没错,没错,没错.......  
What if God was one of us?  
可是如果上帝和我们一样  
Just a slob like one of us?  
就像我们中某一个俗人  
Just a stranger on a bus  
他是一个公车上的陌生人  
Trying to make His way home  
正走在他回家的路上  
If God had a face, what would it look like?  
如果上帝有张面孔会是什么样子？  
And would you want to see  
你会想见见他吗?  
If seeing meant that you would have to believe  
In things like heaven and in Jesus  
And the Saints and all the Prophets  
如果相见  
意味着你不得不相信天堂,耶稣,圣徒和先知这些的东西?  
Yeah, yeah, God is Great  
没错,没错,上帝是伟大的..  
Yeah, yeah, God is Good  
没错,没错,上帝是美好的..  
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah  
没错,没错,没错...~``  
What if God was one of us?  
可是如果上帝和我们一样  
Just a slob like one of us?  
就像我们中某一个俗人  
Just a stranger on a bus  
他是一个公车上的陌生人  
Trying to make His way home  
正走在他回家的路上  
Back up to heaven all alone.  
独自赶回天堂  
Nobody callin' on the phone  
没人会打电话给他  
'Cept for the Pope maybe in Rome.  
也许除了罗马的教皇

没错,没错,没错...  
What if God was one of us?  
Just a slob like one of us?  
Just a stranger on a bus  
Trying to make His way home  
Like a holy rolling stone.  
Back up to heaven all alone  
Just tryin' to make his way Home  
Nobody callin' on the phone  
'Cept for the Pope maybe in Rome.
