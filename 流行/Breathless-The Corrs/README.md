### Breathless歌词：

Go on, go on  
Leave me breathless  
Come On  
The daylight's fading slowly  
But time with you is standing still  
I'm waiting for you only  
The slightest touch and I feel weak  
I cannot lie, from you I cannot hide  
And I'm losing will to try  
Can't hide it, can't fight it  
So go on, go on, come on leave me breathless  
Temp me, tease me, until I can't deny  
This lovin' feeling  
Make me long for your kiss  
Go on, go on, yeah  
Come on  
And if there's no tomorrow  
And all we have is here and now  
I'm happy just to have you  
You're all the love I need somehow  
It's like a dream  
Although I'm not asleep  
And I never want to wake up  
Don't lose it, don't leave it  
So go on, go on, come on leave me breathless  
Temp me, tease me, until I can't deny  
This lovin' feeling  
Make me long for your kiss  
Go on, go on, yeah  
Come on  
And I can't lie  
From you I cannot hide  
And I've lost my will to try  
Can't hide it  
Can't fight it  
So go on, go on, come on leave me breathless  
Temp me, tease me, until I can't deny  
This lovin' feeling  
Make me long for your kiss  
Go on, go on, come on leave me breathless  
Go on, go on, come on leave me breathless  
Go on, go on, come on leave me breathless  
Go on, go on
