_Walk It Talk It_ 是Migos与Drake一同合作的单曲。

Migos，美国说唱三人组，由Quavo、Offset和Takeoff组成。三位成员各有特点，Quavo的声音很像Gucci
Mane、Takeoff的声音听起来比酱爆弟弟更加自信、Offset的声音则让人联想到Future。他们能够创造出典型的trap音乐，他们的音乐总是让人耳目一新。而Drake的音乐对Hip
Hop有颠覆，风格更贴近流行歌曲，无疑更容易被大众接纳。有乐迷就称他为“说唱界的泰勒•斯威夫特”。

She just bought a new ass But got the same boobs (same boobs!)  
Whipping up dope, scientist (whip it up, whip it up)  
(Cook it up, cook it up) (Skrrt-Skrrt!)  
That's my sauce, where you find it?

Adding up checks, no minus  
(Add it up, add it up, add it up) (Add it up, yeah)  
Get your "respek" in diamonds (ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice)  
I bought a 'Plain Jane' Rollie  
These niggas bought they fame (woo!)  
I bet my back got scoliosis 'cause I swerve the lane (skrrt!)  
Heard you signed your life,  
For that brand new chain (I heard)  
Think it came with stripes,  
But you ain't straight with the gang (Gang, gang!)

Aye! I gotta stay in my zone  
Say that we been beefing, dog  
But you on your own!  
First night, she gon' let me fuck 'cause we grown  
I hit her, gave her back  
To the city, she home! (she at home now!)  
That was that  
So I can't be beefing with no wack nigga, got no backbone  
Heard you living in a mansion In all your raps though  
But your shit look like the trap on this Google Maps, though  
We been brothers since Versace bando, whoa  
Name ringing like a Migo trap phone, whoa  
Used to be with Vashtie at Santo's  
That's on Tommy Campos  
We live like 'Sopranos'  
And I-  
Walk it, like I talk it (walk it)  
Walk it, like I talk it  
Walk it, walk it like I talk it (talk it)  
Walk it, like I talk it (woo!)

Quadruple the profit! (profit!)

Drop dead fresh, I need a coffin  
Balling, something we do often (ball)  
Take the pot and I'm splashing up, dolphin (splash)
