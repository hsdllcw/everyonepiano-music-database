### Infinity歌词：

Down to Earth  
即使我知道那会很疼很疼  
Keep 'em falling when I know it hurts  
我以时速百万英里自由坠落  
Going faster than a million miles an hour  
努力深呼吸即使徒劳  
Trying to catch my breath some way, somehow  
我在空中自由坠落  
Down to Earth  
心已被冰封  
It's like I'm frozen, but the world still turns  
然而世界的齿轮仍旧不停转动  
Stuck in motion, but the wheels keep spinning 'round  
时光在倒流，无路可走  
Moving in reverse with no way out  
每当我靠近生命一步  
And now I'm one step closer to being  
我就离你远两步  
Two steps far from you  
每个人都喜欢你  
When everybody wants you  
每个人都想拥有你  
Everybody wants you  
数清天上所有的星星需要多少个夜晚  
How many nights does it take to count the stars?  
我心上的伤痕就需要多少个夜晚来弥补  
That's the time it would take to fix my heart  
亲爱的，我一直在那里等你  
Oh, baby, I was there for you  
我只想要你的真心话，  
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah  
你希望你爱的人停留多少个夜晚  
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?  
你彻夜未眠，祈祷他们平安  
Lay awake only hoping they're okay  
我从来没想过自己能停留多少个夜晚  
I never counted all of mine  
如果可以，我想是永远  
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity  
永远，永远，yeah  
Infinity, infinity, yeah  
永远  
Infinity  
我的眼睛  
Eyes can't shine  
只有看到发光的你时才会闪耀  
Unless there's something burning bright behind  
你离开了，我就一无所有  
Since you went away, there's nothing left in mine  
我感到自己的生命在流逝  
I feel myself running out of time  
每当我靠近生命一步  
And now I'm one step closer to being  
我就离你远两步  
Two steps far from you  
每个人都喜欢你  
When everybody wants you  
每个人都想拥有你  
Everybody wants you  
数清天上所有的星星需要多少个夜晚  
How many nights does it take to count the stars?  
我心上的伤痕就需要多少个夜晚来弥补  
That's the time it would take to fix my heart  
亲爱的，我一直在那里等你  
Oh, baby, I was there for you  
我只想要你的真心话，  
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah  
你希望你爱的人停留多少个夜晚  
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?

Lay awake only hoping they're okay

永远，永远，yeah  
Infinity, infinity, yeah  
永远  
Infinity
