### Traitor歌词：

Ooh ooh  
Ah ah ah ah ah  
Brown guilty eyes and  
Little white lies yeah  
I played dumb but I always knew  
That you talked to her  
Maybe did even worse  
I kept quiet so I could keep you  
And ain't it funny how you ran to her  
The second that we called it quits  
And ain't it funny how you said you were friends  
Now it sure as hell don't look like it  
You betrayed me  
And I know that you'll never feel sorry  
For the way I hurt yeah  
You talked to her when we were together  
Loved you at your worst but that didn't matter  
It took you two weeks to go off and date her  
Guess you didn't cheat but you're still a traitor  
Now you bring her around  
Just to shut me down  
Show her off like she's a new trophy  
And I know if you were true  
There's no d**n way that you  
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly  
And ain't it funny all the twisted games  
All the questions you used to avoid  
Ain't it funny remember I brought her up  
And you told me I was paranoid  
You betrayed me  
And I know that you'll never feel sorry  
For the way I hurt yeah  
You talked to her when we were together  
Loved you at your worst but that didn't matter  
It took you two weeks to go off and date her  
Guess you didn't cheat but you're still a traitor  
Ah-ah-ah  
God I wish that you had thought this through  
Before I went and fell in love with you  
Ah-ah-ah  
When she's sleepin' in the bed we made  
Don't you dare forget about the way you  
Betrayed me  
'Cause I know that you'll never feel sorry  
For the way I hurt yeah  
You talked to her when we were together  
You gave me your word but that didn't matter  
It took you two weeks to go off and date her  
Guess you didn't cheat but you're still you're still a traitor  
Ah-ah-ah  
Yeah you're still a traitor  
Ooh ooh ooh  
God I wish that you had thought this through  
Before I went and fell in love with you
