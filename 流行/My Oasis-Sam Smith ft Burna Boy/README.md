Sam Smith联手Burna Boy新歌“ **My Oasis**
”，依旧没让大家失望。一开口就让人心醉，用独特嗓音诉说内心愿望，探讨爱为何物，情为哪般。渴望爱情，如同身处枯寂的土地上，希望得到一场久旱逢甘霖般的滋润。渴望爱情，如同身处刺骨的寒风中，希望得到一缕温暖人心的阳光普照。渴望爱情，如同身处死亡的荒漠，希望得到一片能活下去的绿洲希望。即使被玩弄于股掌之中，失去理智，无法自拔，也毫无怨言。

### My Oasis歌词：

Sam Smith：  
Keep thinking that I'm seeing water  
You're playing tricks on me in the sun  
See your shadow in the courtyard  
Stays until the day is done  
The desert don't end  
The rain don't fall  
And I can't pretend I don't want you all  
Cos I want you all  
(You all you all you all)  
Oh babe I really need you  
My feelings getting deeper  
My mind is in a free fall  
But there's nothing I can do when it comes to you  
You play with my emotions  
I'm flowing like the ocean  
I pray for your devotion  
Cos there's nothing I can do when it comes to you  
My oasis  
My oasis  
My oasis  
My oasis  
My oasis  
My oasis  
My oasis  
My oasis  
My oasis  
There's nothing I can do when it comes to you  
Burna Boy：  
Wait a minute tell me why you're moving like that  
Na you wey I choose but you make it so hard  
I gave you my heart you're making it so dark  
But there is nothing I can do when it comes to you  
You taking it for granted  
A lot of silence  
The river don't end  
Cuz I want you all  
Yeah  
Sam Smith：  
(You all you all you all)  
Oh babe I really need you  
My feelings getting deeper  
My mind is in a free fall  
But there's nothing I can do when it comes to you  
You play with my emotions  
I'm flowing like the ocean  
I pray for your devotion  
Cos there's nothing I can do when it comes to you  
My oasis  
My oasis  
My oasis  
My oasis  
My oasis  
My oasis  
My oasis  
My oasis  
My oasis  
There's nothing I can do when it comes to you  
My oasis  
My oasis  
My oasis  
My oasis  
My oasis  
My oasis  
My oasis  
My oasis  
My oasis  
There's nothing I can do when it comes to you
