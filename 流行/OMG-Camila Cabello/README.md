### OMG歌词：

[Verse 1: Camila Cabello]  
Baby, what'cha say?  
I ain't here to, I ain't here to conversate  
Baby, I don't play  
From Miami, causin' trouble in LA  
Rowdy, Tennessee  
If I don't send for you, best not come for me  
Jordan, 23  
Guarantee you're gonna wanna leave with me  
[Chorus: Camila Cabello]  
I got that li-li-li-like  
Pull up, pull up, pull up straight from Tokyo  
You cannot believe it when we come through  
Woo, my God, you look good today  
Woo, my God, you look good today, yeah  
Back up, back up, back up, do it slow-mo  
When she drop, it bounce back like a yo-yo  
Woo, my God, you look good today  
You look good today, yeah  
Oh my God  
[Post-Chorus: Quavo & Camila Cabello]  
Oh my God, yah, uh  
Oh my God, you're awesome (Oh my God)  
Oh my God, yah, uh  
Oh my God, you're awesome (Oh my God)  
Oh my God, yah, uh  
Oh my God, you're awesome (Oh my God)  
Oh my God, yah  
[Verse 2: Camila Cabello]  
Ice cold like my drink  
Lose your concentration when you take a sip, yeah (sip it, sip it)  
Cyclone, make it spin  
'Cause all I, all I, all I, all I do is win  
[Bridge: Camila Cabello]  
Yeah, I'm cut like a diamond, I'm cold  
4 AM, bloom like a rose  
Girls like the summer, we're gold, uh  
[Chorus: Camila Cabello]  
We got that li-li-li-like  
Pull up, pull up, pull up straight from Tokyo  
You cannot believe it when we come through (yeah, yeah)  
Woo, my God, you look good today  
Woo, my God, you look good today, yeah  
Back up, back up, back up, do it slow-mo  
When she drop, it bounce back like a yo-yo  
Woo, my God (My God), you look good today  
You look good today, yeah  
Oh my God  
[Post-Chorus: Quavo & Camila Cabello]  
Oh my God, yah, uh  
Oh my God, you're awesome (Oh my God)  
Oh my God, yah, uh  
Oh my God, you're awesome (Oh my God)  
Oh my God, yah, uh  
Oh my God, you're awesome (Oh my God)  
Oh my God, yah  
[Verse 3: Quavo & Camila Cabello]  
Oh my God, she's so right, though (you know you're so right)  
Me and you, that's a iso  
Waist so small, look like lipo (li-lipo)  
Moonwalk, my diamonds Michael (Mi-Michael)  
She's so fine, I call my best man (brr)  
Ain't no rings on her left hand (no rings)  
I had a dream I was in quicksand (dream)  
Then I woke up with the best plans (yeah)  
Oh my God, yah (uh)  
Oh my god, you're awesome (yah)  
Smoke more green than Boston (green)  
I make a play and call 'em (yah)  
Oh my God, she flossin' (woo)  
On the cover of magazines, I'ma crown the queen (queen)  
Bad and boujee, thick and pretty  
I'm givin' her wet dreams (yuh)  
I'm the main reason why her friends like me (hey)  
Havin' her mad at me, tackle me like I'm an athlete (ooh, yuh)  
[Chorus: Camila Cabello]  
Pull up, pull up, pull up straight from Tokyo  
You cannot believe it when we come through  
Woo, my God, you look good today  
Woo, my God, you look good today, yeah  
Back up, back up, back up, do it slow-mo  
When she drop, it bounce back like a yo-yo  
Woo, my God, you look good today  
You look good today, yeah  
Oh my God
