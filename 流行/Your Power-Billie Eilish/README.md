### Your Power歌词：

Try not to abuse your power  
I know we didn't choose to change  
You might not wanna lose your power  
But having it's so strange  
She said you were a hero  
You played the part  
But you ruined her in a year  
Don't act like it was hard  
And you swear you didn't know  
Didn't know  
No wonder why you didn't ask  
She was sleeping in your clothes  
In your clothes  
But now she's got to get to class  
How dare you  
And how could you  
Will you only feel bad when they find out  
If you could take it all back would you  
Try not to abuse your power  
I know we didn't choose to change  
You might not wanna lose your power  
But having it's so strange  
I thought that I was special  
You made me feel  
Like it was my fault you were the devil  
Lost your appeal  
Does it keep you in control  
In control  
For you to keep her in a cage  
And you swear you didn't know  
Didn't know  
You said you thought she was your age  
How dare you  
And how could you  
Will you only feel bad if it turns out  
That they kill your contract would you  
Try not to abuse your power  
I know we didn't choose to change  
You might not wanna lose your power  
But power isn't pain
