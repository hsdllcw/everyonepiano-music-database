### Fade歌词：

It ain't no wonder why we lose control  
When we're always heart attack away from falling in love  
Well I know that we've been hardly holding on  
To tell the truth I can't believe we got this far  
Running near on empty  
I wish somebody would've told me  
That I'd end up so caught up in need of your demons  
That I'd be lost without you leading me astray  
Guess that I'm a fool for the way that you caught me  
Girl you make my heart break more every day  
But don't fade away  
And when I'm just about to pass the point of it all  
You come ripping all the air from out of my lungs  
And now it's so hard to be  
I wish somebody would've told me  
That I'd end up so caught up in need of your demons  
That I'd be lost without you leading me astray  
Guess that I'm a fool for the way that you caught me  
Girl you make my heart break more every day  
Well I know that we've been hardly holding on  
To tell the truth I can't believe we got this far oh  
Well I know that we've been hardly holding on  
To tell the truth I can't believe we got this far  
Somebody would've told me  
Somebody would've told me  
That I'd end up so caught up in need of your demons  
That I'd be lost without you leading me astray  
Guess I'm such a f**king fool for the way that you caught me  
Girl you make my heart break more every day  
But don't fade away  
Well I know that we've been hardly holding on  
To tell the truth I can't believe we got this far  
Don't fade away  
Well I know that we've been hardly holding on  
To tell the truth I can't believe we got this far  
Don't fade away
