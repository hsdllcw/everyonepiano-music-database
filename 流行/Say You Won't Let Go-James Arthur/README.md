### Say You Won't Let Go歌词：

I met you in the dark  
You lit me up  
You made me feel as though  
I was enough  
We danced the night away  
We drank too much  
I held your hair back when  
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder  
For a minute, I was stone cold sober  
I pulled you closer to my chest  
And you asked me to stay over  
I said, I already told ya  
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then  
But you'd never know  
Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go  
I know I needed you  
But I never showed  
But I wanna stay with you  
Until we're grey and old  
Just say you won't let go  
Just say you won't let go

I wake you up with some breakfast in bed  
I'll bring you coffee  
With a kiss on your head  
And I'll take the kids to school  
Wave them goodbye  
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder  
For a minute, I forget that I'm older  
I wanna dance with you right now, oh  
And you look as beautiful as ever  
And I swear that everyday you'll get better  
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you  
And I hope you know  
Darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold  
We've come so far my dear  
Look how we've grown  
And I wanna stay with you  
Until we're grey and old  
Just say you won't let go  
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you  
Even when we're ghosts  
Cause you were always there for me  
When I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till  
My lungs give out  
I promise till death we part  
Like in our vows  
So I wrote this song for you  
Now everybody knows  
That it's just you and me  
Until we're grey and old  
Just say you won't let go  
Just say you won't let go

Just say you won't let go  
Oh, just say you won't let go
