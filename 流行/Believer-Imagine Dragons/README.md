### Believer歌词：

First things first  
I'ma say all the words inside my head  
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh  
The way that things have been, oh-ooh  
Second thing second  
Don't you tell me what you think that I can be  
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh  
The master of my sea, oh-ooh

I was broken from a young age  
Taking my sulking to the masses  
Writing my poems for the few  
That looked at me took to me, shook to me, feeling me  
Singing from heart ache from the pain  
Take up my message from the veins  
Speaking my lesson from the brain  
Seeing the beauty through the...

Pain!  
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer  
Pain!  
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer  
Pain!  
I let the bullets fly, oh let them rain  
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...  
Pain!  
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Third things third  
Send a prayer to the ones up above  
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh  
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

I was choking in the crowd  
Living my brain up in the cloud  
Falling like ashes to the ground  
Hoping my feelings, they would drown  
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing  
Inhibited, limited  
Till it broke open and it rained down  
It rained down, like...

Pain!  
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer  
Pain!  
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer  
Pain!  
I let the bullets fly, oh let them rain  
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...  
Pain!  
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Last things last  
By the grace of the fire and the flames  
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh  
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh  
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing  
Inhibited, limited  
Till it broke open and it rained down  
It rained down, like...

Pain!  
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer  
Pain!  
You break me down, you built me up, believer, believer  
Pain!  
I let the bullets fly, oh let them rain  
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...  
Pain!  
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
