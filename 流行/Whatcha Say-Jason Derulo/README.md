### Whatcha Say歌词：

Wh-wh-wh-what did she say?  
Mmm whatcha say?  
Mmm that you only meant well?  
Well of course you did  
Mmm whatcha say?  
(Jason Derulo)  
Mmm that it's all for the best?  
Of course it is

I was so wrong for so long  
Only tryin' to please myself  
Girl, I was caught up in her lust  
When I don't really want no one else

So, no, I know I should've treated you better  
But me and you were meant to last forever  
So let me in  
(Let me in)  
Give me another chance  
(Another chance)  
To really be your man

'Cause when the roof caved in and the truth came out  
I just didn't know what to do  
But when I become a star we'll be living so large  
I'll do anything for you  
So tell me girl

Mmm whatcha say?  
Mmm that you only meant well?  
Well of course you did  
Mmm whatcha say?  
(Whatcha say? Whatcha say?)  
Mmm that it's all for the best?  
Of course it is

Mmm whatcha say?  
Mmm that you only meant well?  
Well of course you did  
Mmm whatcha say?  
(Whatcha say? Whatcha say?)  
Wh-wh-wh-what did she say?

How could I live with myself  
Knowing that I let our love go?  
And ooh, what I'd do for one chance  
I just gotta let you know

I know what I did wasn't clever  
But me and you were meant to be together  
So let me in  
(Let me in)  
Give me another chance  
(Another chance)  
To really be your man

'Cause when the roof caved in and the truth came out  
I just didn't know what to do  
But when I become a star we'll be living so large  
I'll do anything for you  
So tell me girl

Mmm whatcha say?  
Mmm that you only meant well?  
Well of course you did  
Mmm whatcha say?  
(Whatcha say? Whatcha say?)  
Mmm that it's all for the best?  
Of course it is

Mmm whatcha say?  
Mmm that you only meant well?  
Well of course you did  
Mmm whatcha say?  
(Whatcha say? Whatcha say?)  
Wh-wh-wh-what did she say?

Girl, tell me whatcha said  
I don't want you to leave me  
Though you caught me cheatin'  
Tell me, tell me whatcha said  
I really need you in my life  
'Cause things ain't right, girl

Tell me, tell me whatcha said  
I don't want you to leave me  
Though you caught me cheatin'  
Tell me, tell me whatcha said  
I really need you in my life  
'Cause things ain't right

Cause when the roof caved in and the truth came out  
I just didn't know what to do  
(I just didn't know what to do)  
But when I become a star we'll be living so large  
I'll do anything for you  
So baby watcha say?

Mmm whatcha say?  
Mmm that you only meant well?  
Well of course you did  
(Well of course I did, baby)  
Mmm whatcha say?  
(Whatcha say? Whatcha say?)  
Mmm that it's all for the best?  
Of course it is  
(Well, of course it is)

Mmm whatcha say?  
Mmm that you only meant well?  
(Whatcha say?)  
Well of course you did  
Mmm whatcha say?  
(Whatcha say? Whatcha say?)  
Wh-wh-wh-what did she say?
