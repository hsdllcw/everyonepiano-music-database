**Illicit Affairs** 出自美国创作歌手Taylor Swift发行的第八张录音室专辑《Folklore》（民间故事）。

专辑定于Swift上一张录音室专辑《恋人》的十一个月后发行，灵感源于2019冠状病毒病疫情大爆发期间，Swift响应居家隔离时，构思并创作制作完成，由Swift、杰克•安东诺夫及亚伦•戴斯纳担任专辑制作人。《民间故事》仅于发行前一日才被Swift透过社群媒体公布。与Swift以前发行的主流流行乐专辑不同，《民间故事》是由钢琴和吉他铺成的独立民谣、另类摇滚、电子民谣和室内流行专辑。歌词方面，专辑的歌曲结合了生动的讲故事及第三人称叙事。

### Illicit Affairs歌词：

Make sure nobody sees you leave  
Hood over your head  
Keep your eyes down  
Tell your friends you're out for a run  
You'll be flushed when you return  
Take the road less traveled by  
Tell yourself you can always stop  
What started in beautiful rooms  
Ends with meetings in parking lots  
And that's the thing about illicit affairs  
And clandestine meetings  
And longing stares  
It's born from just one single glance  
But it dies and it dies and it dies  
A million little times  
Leave the perfume on the shelf  
That you picked out just for him  
So you leave no trace behind  
Like you don't even exist  
Take the words for what they  
Are A dwindling mercurial high  
A d**g that only worked  
The first few hundred times  
And that's the thing about illicit affairs  
And clandestine meetings  
And stolen stares  
They show their truth one single time  
But they lie and they lie and they lie  
A million little times  
And you wanna scream  
Don't call me kid  
Don't call me baby  
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me  
You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else  
Don't call me kid  
Don't call me baby  
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me  
You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else  
And you know d**n well  
For you I would ruin myself  
A million little times
