### One Right Now歌词：

Na-na-na-na, na-na  
Na-na-na-na, oh no  
Yeah, yeah  
Said you love me, but I don't care  
That I broke my hand on the same wall  
That you told me that he fucked you on (Oh)  
You think it's so easy fuckin' with my feelings  
I got one comin' over and one right now (Uh)  
One right now  
(One right now, one right now, oh)  
I got one comin' over and one right now  
Said you wanna have my babies  
I fucked you so good, you should pay me  
Don't call me "baby" when you did me so wrong  
(When you did me so wrong)  
But I got over what you did already  
Body for a body, so petty  
How many of your friends fit in my Rolls? (Can you fit in my Rolls?)  
Bought you a new face, you should call me "Dad," baby  
Hermès, but you dropped the bag, baby  
Truth is, maybe one's just not enough  
You say you love me, but I don't care  
That I broke my hand on the same wall  
That you told me that he fucked you on (That he fucked you on)  
You think it's so easy fuckin' with my feelings (Feelings)  
I got one comin' over and one right now (Uh)  
One right now (Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
(One right now, one right now, oh yeah)  
I got one comin' over and one right now (Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
(One right now, one right now, oh)  
I got one comin' over and one right now  
You're a stain on my legacy  
We can't be friends, can't be family (Oh)  
You probably fuck all my enemies (Oh)  
I can't let you be next to me  
Oh, you belong to the world now  
So just leave me alone now  
We're not in touch no more  
You say you love me, but I don't care (No, I don't care)  
That I broke my hand on the same wall  
That you told me that he fucked you on (Oh)  
You think it's so easy fuckin' with my feelings (Feelings)  
I got one comin' over and one right now  
One right now (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)  
(Fuckin' with my, fuckin' with my feelings)  
I got one comin' over and one right now  
(Ooh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)  
(One right now)  
I got one comin' over and one right now  
(Hey)  
(One right now, one right now)  
(Ooh yeah)  
I got one comin' over and one right now
