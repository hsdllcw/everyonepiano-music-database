### Wolves歌词：

In your eyes, there's a heavy blue  
你有着一双深蓝色的眼眸  
One to love, and one to lose  
左眼蕴藏爱意 右眼闪烁黯然  
Sweet divine, a heavy truth  
从甜蜜中我察觉到那沉重的事实  
Water or wine, don't make me choose  
千万别让我喝什么离别酒  
I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, night  
我只想重温我们曾一起共度的仲夏之夜  
Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky  
独自在醉意朦胧间仰望繁星点点  
I've been running through the jungle  
我在丛林中不断奔跑  
I've been running with the wolves  
我和狼群一同前行  
To get to you, to get to you  
只为追寻你 前往你身旁  
I've been down the darkest alleys  
我一路沿着墨色浓重的小径前行  
Saw the dark side of the moon  
抬头遥望月球的背面  
To get to you, to get to you  
只为追寻你 前往你身旁  
I've looked for love in every stranger  
我在每个过客的心中搜索爱的踪迹  
Took too much to ease the anger  
喝下太多的酒才稍稍缓解心头之愤  
All for you, yeah, all for you  
都是为了你 都是因为你  
I've been running through the jungle  
我在丛林中不断奔跑  
I've been crying with the wolves  
我和狼群一起嗥鸣  
To get to you, to get to you, to get to you  
只为追寻你 前往你身旁 将你找寻  
To get to you  
只为追寻你  
To get to you  
只为追寻你  
Your fingertips trace my skin  
你的指尖摩挲着我的肌肤  
To places I have never been  
带我去领略从未踏足之境  
Blindly, I am following  
我就这样不假思索地盲从  
Break down these walls and come on in  
越过这垒垒高墙 一窥其中奥妙  
I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, night  
我只想重温我们曾一起共度的仲夏之夜  
Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky  
独自在醉意朦胧间仰望繁星点点  
I've been running through the jungle  
我在丛林中不断奔跑  
I've been running with the wolves
