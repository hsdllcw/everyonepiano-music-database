### Look Up At The Stars歌词：

Look up at the stars they're like pieces of art  
Floating above the ground  
It's a Friday night  
And the streetlights are all saying your name  
They always say your name  
Before you go home I should let you know  
I'm so glad that you came  
I know that we went late but  
Look up at the stars  
They're like pieces of art  
Floating above the ground  
You know we could fly so far  
The universe is ours  
I'm not gonna let you down  
I am feeling so lucky  
Lucky lucky lucky  
The sun shining down on me  
On me on me on me  
Got these angels all around mе  
I'll never be alonе  
Look up at the stars they're like pieces of art  
Floating above the ground  
You know we could fly so far  
The universe is ours  
And I'm not gonna let you down  
Finally we've met  
Now the lights are set  
It's taken us till now  
To be together in this town yeah  
A couple of years we've been making plans  
Somehow you always seem to understand  
So let me spend the night in wonderland with you  
I am feeling so lucky  
Lucky lucky lucky  
The sun shining down on me  
On me on me on me  
Got these angels all around me  
I'll never be alone  
Look up at the stars they're like pieces of art  
Floating above the ground  
You know we could fly so far  
The universe is ours  
And I'm not gonna let you down
