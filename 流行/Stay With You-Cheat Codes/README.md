### Stay With You歌词：

Yeah, I know, know I'm scared of commitment  
But tell me who isn't, tell me who isn't  
I know, it's easier being alone  
But when you come over again  
I'm not gonna pretend I want anyone else 'cause I don't  
I'm tired of being alone  
I wanna stay with you, you, you  
Make love all day with you, you, you  
Stay sipping champagne with you, you, you  
If you wanna do drugs, come through, through, through  
I wanna stay with you, you, you  
Make love all day with you, you, you  
Stay sipping champagne with you, you, you  
If you wanna do drugs, come through, through, through  
I wanna stay with  
Stay with, with  
So let's start where we left  
We can lay in my bed but we won't go to bed  
No we won't  
I'm not one for taking it slow  
So when you come again and again  
With the sheets in your hand  
You can't even pretend that you don't  
Love how I make you moan  
I wanna stay with you, you, you  
Make love all day with you, you, you  
Stay sipping champagne with you, you, you  
If you wanna do drugs, come through, through, through  
I wanna stay with you, you, you  
Make love all day with you, you, you  
Stay sipping champagne with you, you, you  
If you wanna do drugs, come through, through, through  
I wanna stay with  
Stay with, with  
Ooh, stay  
Stay with  
With you  
Stay with you  
Stay with you  
Stay with you  
I'm not looking for something new  
I wanna stay with you, you, you  
Make love all day with you, you, you  
Stay sipping champagne with you, you, you  
If you wanna do drugs, come through, through, through  
I wanna stay with you, yeah  
Stay with, with  
Ooh, stay  
Stay with  
Ooh, with you
