### Burnin' It Down歌词：

You slip your finger through the tear in my t-shirt  
You stirrin' up dirty in the back of my mind  
You keep on flirtin' cause you know that it's workin'  
You stuck in my head girl writing the lines  
Couldn't sing this song without you if I tried  
Let's light it up like it's our last night

We're just hanging around  
Burnin' it down  
Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's  
Jammin' to some old Alabama with you, baby  
Laying right here naked in my bed  
I'm just doing my thing  
You love it when I sing  
Say it makes you feel like an angel  
We about to get a little tangled up right about now  
So girl let's keep burnin' it down  
Burnin' it down  
Burnin' it down

Girl when you want it, you know that I'm on it  
You know that I love lovin' up on you  
Let's hit the switch and let our shadows dance  
And light it up like it's our last chance

We're just hanging around  
Burnin' it down  
Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's  
Jammin' to some old Alabama with you, baby  
Laying right here dreaming in my bed  
I'm just doing my thing  
You love it when I sing  
Say it makes you feel like an angel  
We about to get a little tangled up right about now  
So girl let's keep burnin' it down  
Burnin' it down  
Burnin' it down  
Burnin' it down

Burnin' it down  
Burnin' it down  
Burnin' it down

I wanna rock it all night  
Baby girl, will you rock it out with me?  
I wanna crawl through the dark  
Just to feel your heartbeat against me  
[x2]

We're just hanging around  
Burnin' it down  
Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's  
Jammin' to some old Alabama with you baby  
Laying right here naked in my bed  
I'm just doing my thing  
You love it when I sing  
Say it makes you feel like an angel  
We about to get a little tangled up right about now  
So girl let's keep burnin' it down  
Burnin' it down  
Burnin' it down  
Burnin' it down

Burnin' it down  
Burnin' it down  
Burnin' it down

I wanna rock it all night  
Baby girl, will you rock it out with me?  
I wanna crawl through the dark  
Just to feel your heartbeat against me
