### Believe歌词：

You may call it in this evening  
But you've only lost the night  
Preset all your pretty feelings  
May they comfort you tonight  
And I'm climbing over something  
And I'm running through these walls

I don't even know if I believe [x3]  
Everything you're trying to say to me

I had the strangest feeling  
Your world's not all it seems  
So tired of misconceiving  
What else this could've been

I don't even know if I believe [x3]  
Everything you're trying to say to me

So open up my eyes  
Tell me I'm alive  
This is never gonna go our way  
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind

Say something, say something,  
Something like you love me  
Less you wanna move away  
From the noise of this place

Well I don't even know if I believe [x2]  
I don't even know if I wanna believe  
Anything you're trying to say to me

[x2:]  
So, open up my eyes  
Tell me I'm alive  
This is never gonna go our way  
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind
