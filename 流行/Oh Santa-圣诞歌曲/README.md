### Oh Santa!歌词：

Santas gonna come and make you  
Mine this Christmas  
Santas gonna come and make you mine mine  
OH SANTA  
OH SANTA  
SANTA  
If you get this letter Won't you help me out  
I know you're kinda busy  
With your elves right now  
And I don't know how  
You do the things you do  
While I sleep on Christmas eve But it's amazing  
And I bet that you could bring me back my baby  
Because every time I see Christmas lights  
I feel this burn inside And I just can't take it  
I saw them shopping last week  
And his new girl was so bleak  
And then I swore to myself  
Santa's gonna come and make him  
Mine this Christmas night  
Oh oh oh  
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas  
Santa's gonna come and make you mine oh oh oh  
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas night  
Oh Santa  
I heard that it's really gonna snow this year  
So I hope Rudolph and them all the 8 reindeer  
Get you safely here So you can scoop him up  
And scoop him right down my chimney  
I've been really really really good this year  
So put on that red suit and make him appear  
Make this Christmas cheer  
Just ain't the same without my baby  
Come on oh Kris Kringle send me help  
They say it's unrealistic  
But I believe in you Saint Nick  
So grant this wish for me right quick  
Santa won't you come and make him  
Mine this Christmas night  
Oh oh oh  
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas  
Santa's gonna come and make you mine oh oh oh  
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas night  
Oh Santa Oh Santa  
Oh Santa Claus  
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas  
Santa's gonna come and make you mine mine  
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas  
Santa's gonna come and make you mine mine  
Oh Santa Claus  
If you get this letter Please don't make me wait  
All December I'll be counting down the days  
So hop on your sleigh  
I promise that I won't forget the milk and cookies  
The trees all sparkly and gold But inside I feel so cold  
So soon as you leave the North Pole  
Santa won't you come and make him mine this Christmas  
Santa's gonna come and make you mine oh oh oh  
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas  
Santa's gonna come and make you mine oh oh oh  
Santa's gonna come and make you mine mine  
Santa's gonna come and make you mine oh oh oh  
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas  
Santa's gonna come and make you mine oh oh oh  
Santa's gonna come and make you mine mine  
Santa's gonna come and make you mine oh oh oh  
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas  
Santa's gonna come and make you mine oh oh oh  
Santa's gonna come and make you mine mine
