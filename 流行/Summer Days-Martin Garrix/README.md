### Summer Days歌词：

I got this feeling on a summer day  
Knew it when I saw her face  
I just thought that she could be the one  
She looks good in the morning  
And she don't even know it  
I don't want you to go yet  
Can we stay in the moment  
Don't look in the mirror look into my eyes  
When you see your reflection  
You'll see what I like  
You look good in the morning  
And you don't even know it  
I knew that  
I got this feeling on a summer day  
Knew it when I saw her face  
I just thought that she could be the one  
I got this feeling on a summer day  
Knew it when I saw her face  
I just thought that she could be the one  
Sundress with you on my arm  
Take the coupe out the garage  
Pull the roof back just me you and the stars  
Toast to the gods  
She's the one  
A masterpiece  
She a drug  
Got a fast release  
Got me sprung  
Wrapped in sheets  
Wake up  
F**k and then we going back to sleep  
Me and you on an island  
With the ocean color stuck in your iris  
We're comfortable in silence  
But I prefer when we wilding  
Sundress  
Nothing underneath as we undress  
You could look in my eyes  
See I'm some mess  
Couple of broken people  
Trying to complete each other under one breath  
Don't look in the mirror look into my eyes  
When you see your reflection  
You'll see what I like  
You look good in the morning  
And you don't even know it  
I knew that  
I got this feeling on a summer day  
Knew it when I saw her face  
I just thought that she could be the one  
I got this feeling on a summer day  
Knew it when I saw her face  
I just thought that she could be the one
