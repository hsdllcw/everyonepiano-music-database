《 **Can I Get It**
》是由英国女歌手Adele录唱的一首歌曲，收录于2021年发行的专辑《30》。虽然专辑叫《30》，但实际上讲述的不是三十岁，而是三十岁以后的人生感悟，所以其实这张专辑应该翻译成《三十以后》。如今Adele
更加关注自己的感受，更善于将自己的情感感受塑造成歌曲，创作出了这张充满心痛、母性、绝望和孤独的专辑《30》。

《 _Can I Get It_
》此曲表达了倾其所有疯狂去爱，但在不断发问，我能得到爱吗？我能修复自我吗？编曲用大量节奏和吉他铺陈，副歌的人声让位，去突出编曲，整首歌特别有黄老板的味道。

### Can I Get It歌词：

Pave me a path to follow  
And I'll tread any dangerous road  
I will beg and I'll steal I will borrow  
If I can make it if I can make your heart my home  
Throw me to the water  
I don't care how deep or shallow  
Because my heart can pound like thunder  
And your love and your love can set me free  
Oh I have promised I will love you till the end of time  
Through it all the good the bad the ugly and divine  
I will be the melody the rhythm and your rhyme  
All I want is for you to be mine mine  
So can I get it right now  
Mm  
Can I get it right now  
Can I get it here  
Can I get it right now  
Can I get it right now  
Let me let me just come and get it  
Can I get it  
You tease me with your control  
Because I long to live under your spell  
And without your love I'm hollow  
I won't make it I won't make it on my own  
Oh I have promised I will love you till the end of time  
The end of time  
Through it all the good the bad the ugly and divine  
So divine  
I will be the melody the rhythm and your rhyme  
Mh-mh-mh  
All I want is for you to be mine mine  
So can I get it right now  
Mm  
Can I get it right now  
Can I get it here  
Can I get it right now  
Can I get it right now  
Let me let me just come and get it  
Can I get it  
When will you run with me  
Like I know you wanna  
Like you want to like you want to  
You're the one for me  
And I'm counting on you to put the pieces of me back together  
So can I get it right now  
Mm  
Can I get it right now  
Mm mm  
Can I get it right now  
Can I get it right now  
Let me let me just come and get it
