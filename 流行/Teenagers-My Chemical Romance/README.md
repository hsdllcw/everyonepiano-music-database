### Teenagers歌词：

They're gonna clean up your looks  
With all the lies in the books  
To make a citizen out of you  
Because they sleep with a gun  
And keep an eye on you, son  
So they can watch all the things you do  
Because the drugs never work  
They're gonna give you a smirk  
'Cause they got methods of keeping you clean  
They're gonna rip up your heads  
Your aspirations to shreds  
Another cog in the murder machine  
They say that teenagers scare the living shit out of me  
They couldn't care less as long as someone'll bleed  
So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose  
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me  
The boys and girls in the clique  
The awful names that they stick  
You're never gonna fit in much, kid  
But if you're troubled and hurt  
What you got under your shirt  
We'll make them pay for the things that they did  
They say that teenagers scare the living shit out of me  
They couldn't care less as long as someone'll bleed  
So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose  
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me  
Ohh yeah!  
They say that teenagers scare the living shit out of me  
They couldn't care less as long as someone'll bleed  
So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose  
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me  
All together now!  
Teenagers scare the living shit out of me  
They couldn't care less as long as someone'll bleed  
So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose  
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me  
Teenagers scare the living shit out of me  
They couldn't care less as long as someone'll bleed  
So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose  
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
