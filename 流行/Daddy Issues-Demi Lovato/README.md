### Daddy Issues歌词：

I call you too much  
You never pick up  
Except when you wanna f**k  
And I can't get enough  
You're the man of my dreams  
'Cause you know how to leave  
But I really believe that you'd change it for me  
You're unavailable unavailable  
I'm insatiable  
Lucky for you I got all these daddy issues  
What can I do  
I'm going crazy when I'm with you  
Forget all the therapy that I've been through  
Lucky for you  
I got all these daddy issues  
All these daddy issues  
Daddy issues uh daddy issues uh  
Don't know how to commit  
But I might want your kid  
And after our first kiss  
Got your name on my wrist  
Yeah I get a little obsessive  
A little aggressive a little bit too invested  
And whatever you want whenever you want  
That's what you get 'cause  
You're unavailable unavailable  
I'm insatiable  
Lucky for you  
I got all these daddy issues  
What can I do  
I'm going crazy when I'm with you  
Forget all the therapy that I've been through  
Lucky for you I got all these daddy issues  
All these daddy issues  
Daddy issues uh  
Daddy issues uh  
Never enough  
Addicted to love with the wrong one  
Lucky for you I got all these daddy issues  
What can I do  
I'm going crazy when I'm with you  
Forget all the therapy that I've been through  
Lucky for you I got all these daddy issues  
All these daddy issues  
Daddy issues uh  
All these daddy issues  
Daddy issues uh  
All these daddy issues  
Daddy issues uh  
Daddy issues uh
