### Bury a Friend歌词：

What do you want from me  
Why don't you run from me  
What are you wondering  
What do you know  
Why aren't you scared of me  
Why do you care for me  
When we all fall asleep where do we go  
Come here  
Say it spit it out what is it exactly  
You're payin' is the amount cleanin' you out am I satisfactory  
Today I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly  
The way I'm drinkin' you down  
Like I wanna drown like I wanna end me  
Step on the glass staple your tongue  
Bury a friend try to wake up  
Cannibal class killing the sun  
Bury a friend I wanna end me  
I wanna end me  
I wanna I wanna I wanna end me  
I wanna I wanna I wanna  
What do you want from me  
Why don't you run from me  
What are you wondering  
What do you know  
Why aren't you scared of me  
Why do you care for me  
When we all fall asleep where do we go  
Listen  
Keep you in the dark what had you expected  
Me to make you my art and make you a star  
And get you connected  
I'll meet you in the park I'll be calm and collected  
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart  
'Cause I'm too expensive  
Your talk'll be somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud  
Honestly I thought that I would be dead by now  
Calling security keepin' my head held down  
Bury the hatchet or bury your friend right now  
For the debt I owe gotta sell my soul  
'Cause I can't say no no I can't say no  
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close  
And I can't say no I can't say no  
Careful  
Step on the glass staple your tongue  
Bury a friend try to wake up  
Cannibal class killing the sun  
Bury a friend I wanna end me  
I wanna end me  
I wanna I wanna I wanna end me  
I wanna I wanna I wanna  
What do you want from me  
Why don't you run from me  
What are you wondering  
What do you know  
Why aren't you scared of me  
Why do you care for me  
When we all fall asleep where do we go
