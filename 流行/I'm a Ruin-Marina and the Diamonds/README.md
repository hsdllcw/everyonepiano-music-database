### I'm a Ruin歌词：

I know that I can't have it all  
But without you I am afraid I'll fall  
I know I'm playing with your heart  
And I could treat you better but I'm not that smart

When it comes to love, you're an easy fight  
A flower in a gun, a bird in flight  
It isn't fair and it isn't right  
To lead you on like it's all alright

I played with your heart  
And I could treat you better but I'm not that smart  
You still mean everything to me  
To me  
But I wanna be free

I'll ruin, yeah, I'll ruin you (I'll ruin you)  
I've been doing things I shouldn't do (Things I shouldn't do)

Yeah, uh huh, ooh, yeah  
Yeah, uh huh, ooh, yeah

It's difficult to move on  
When nothing was right and nothing's wrong  
You still can't look me in the eye  
'Cause you've been bitten once and now you're twice as shy

I've had my share of beautiful men  
But I'm still young and I wanna love again  
It's difficult to say goodbye  
And easier to live a lover's lie

And I've tried to say  
Babe, I'm gonna ruin you if you let me stay  
You still mean everything to me,  
To me  
But I wanna be free

I'll ruin, yeah, I'll ruin you (I'll ruin you)  
I've been doing things I shouldn't do (Things I shouldn't do)

Yeah, uh huh, ooh, yeah  
Yeah, uh huh, ooh, yeah

It doesn't feel right and it doesn't feel fair  
When I'm planning to move on and you're still standing there  
Don't wanna keep a secret but I don't know how to keep it fair, yeah

I'll ruin, yeah, I'll ruin you (I'll ruin you)  
I've been doing things I shouldn't do (Things I shouldn't do)

But I don't wanna say goodbye  
But, baby, I don't wanna lie  
To lie, to lie to you  
I'm a ruin

Yeah, uh huh, ooh, yeah  
Yeah, uh huh, ooh, yeah  
Yeah, uh huh, ooh, yeah
