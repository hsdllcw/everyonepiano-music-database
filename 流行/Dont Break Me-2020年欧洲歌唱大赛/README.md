### Don't Break Me歌词：

I don't feel the same buzz when your name comes up on my phone anymore  
Feels like I don't feel you, I fear you and it makes me cry on my floor  
It feels like you're taking me for granted  
I've given you everything I have, yeah  
And I can barely bring to mind the reason why I've stretched myself so far for
you  
But oh, oh, oh I can't take it anymore  
Don't break me Don't break me down, down, down, down  
Don't break me  
Are you hearing me now, now, now, now?  
You thought I was elastic  
But maybe I'm just made of glass  
Don't break me Don't break me down  
Isn't love a compromise, two people tryin' to keep the fire burning?  
You've been busy playing 'round and starting fights while I've been busy
earning  
Every time that I try to explain it  
You think that your pain is more important  
And the hardest thing is that I don't want to give it up, I love you, I love
you, I love you  
But oh, oh, oh I can't take it anymore  
Don't break me  
Don't break me down, down, down, down  
Don't break me  
Are you hearing me now, now, now, now?  
You thought I was elastic  
But maybe I'm just made of glass  
Don't break me Don't break me down  
I lie awake while you're asleep  
I listen to the sound of all the words I couldn't say till now  
Don't break me  
Don't break me down, down, down, down  
Don't break me  
Are you hearing me now, now, now?  
You though I was elastic  
But maybe I'm just made of glass  
Don't break me  
Don't break me down  
Don't break me
