### Uma Thurman歌词：

I can move mountains  
I can work a miracle, work a miracle  
I'll keep you like an oath  
"May nothing but death do us part..."

She wants to dance like Uma Thurman  
Bury me 'til I confess  
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman  
And I can’t get you out of my head

The stench, the stench of summer sex  
And CK eternity, oh, hell, yes  
Divide me down to the smallest I can be  
Put your, put your v-v-venom in me

I can move mountains  
I can work a miracle, work a miracle  
I'll keep you like an oath  
"May nothing but death do us part..."

She wants to dance like Uma Thurman  
Bury me 'til I confess  
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman  
And I can’t get you out of my head

The blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb  
Is worth two lions, but here I am  
And I slept in last night’s clothes and tomorrow’s dreams  
But they’re not quite what they seem

I can move mountains  
I can work a miracle, work a miracle  
I'll keep you like an oath  
"May nothing but death do us part..."

You’ll find your way  
And may death find you alive  
Take me down the line  
In Gem City we turned the tide  
You’ll find your way  
And may death find you alive  
Take me down the line  
In Gem City we turned the tide

She wants to dance like Uma Thurman  
Bury me 'til I confess  
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman  
And I can’t get you out of my head

I can move mountains  
I can work a miracle, work a miracle  
I'll keep you like an oath  
"May nothing but death do us part..."

I can move mountains  
I can work a miracle, work a miracle  
I'll keep you like an oath  
"May nothing but death do us part..."
