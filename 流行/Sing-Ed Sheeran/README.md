### Sing歌词：

It’s late in the evening  
Glass on the side now  
I've been sat with you  
For most of the night  
Ignoring everybody here  
We wish they would disappear  
So maybe we could get down now  
I don’t wanna know  
If you’re getting ahead of the program  
I want you to be mine, lady  
To hold your body close  
Take another step into the no-man’s land  
For the longest time lady  
I need you darling  
Come on set the tone  
If you feel you’re falling  
Won’t you let me know  
If you love me come on get involved  
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe  
Sing!  
Louder!  
Sing!  
This love is a blaze  
I saw flames from the side of the stage  
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days  
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know  
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke  
Let it go until our roads'll change  
Singing we found love in a local rave  
No, I don’t really know what I’m supposed to say  
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray  
I told her my name and said, "it’s nice to meet ya," and then she handed me of
a bottle of water filled with tequila.  
I already know she’s a keeper  
Just from this one small act of kindness I’m in deep  
If anybody finds out  
I’m meant to drive home but I’ve drunk all of it now no  
Sobering up we just sit on the couch  
One thing led to another  
Now she’s kissing my mouth  
I need you darling  
Come on set the tone  
If you feel you’re falling  
Won’t you let me know  
If you love me come on get involved  
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe  
Sing!  
Louder!  
Sing!  
Can you feel it? All the guys in here don’t really wanna dance  
Can you feel it? All that I can hear is music from the back  
Can you feel it? Found you hiding here so won't you take my hand darling  
Before the beat kicks in again  
Can you feel it?  
Can you feel it?  
Sing! (oh-oh, oh-oh)  
I need you darling  
Come on set the tone  
If you feel you’re falling  
Won’t you let me know  
Sing!  
If you love me come on get involved  
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe  
Sing!
