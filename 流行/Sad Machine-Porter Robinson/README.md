### Sad Machine歌词：

It's anyone there  
Play  
Who survives  
Somebody knew  
Anyone else that knew  
On a lonely night  
Once the burning light  
And though I know  
Since you've awakened her again  
She depends on you she depends on you  
Should go on and never speak of this again  
We depend on you we depend on you  
And though I know  
Since you've awakened her again  
She depends on you she depends on you  
Should go on and never speak of this again  
We depend on you we depend on you  
Play  
I don't know much about your  
Life beyond these warm walls  
The fleeting sense of love within  
The star was taking home  
I don't hear it in his voice in every calm  
Let's go much flat  
A hundred years had something lift away  
I'm going home since you've awakened her again  
She depends on you she depends on you  
Should go on and never speak of this again  
We depend on you we depend on you  
I'm going home since you've awakened her again  
She depends on you she depends on you  
Should go on and never speak of this again  
We depend on you we depend on you  
And though I know  
Since you've awakened her again  
She depends on you she depends on you  
Should go on and never speak of this again  
We depend on you we depend on you  
Play
