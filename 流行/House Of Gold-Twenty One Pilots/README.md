### House of Gold歌词：

[Verse 1]  
She asked me, "Son, when I grow old  
Will you buy me a house of gold?  
And when your father turns to stone  
Will you take care of me?"

[Chorus]  
She asked me, "Son, when I grow old  
Will you buy me a house of gold?  
And when your father turns to stone  
Will you take care of me?"  
I will make you queen of everything you see  
I'll put you on the map  
I'll cure you of disease  
[Verse 2]  
Let's say we up and left this town  
And turned our future upside down  
We'll make pretend that you and me  
Live ever after happily

[Chorus]  
She asked me, "Son, when I grow old  
Will you buy me a house of gold?  
And when your father turns to stone  
Will you take care of me?"  
I will make you queen of everything you see  
I'll put you on the map  
I'll cure you of disease

[Verse 3]  
And since we know that dreams are dead  
And life turns plans up on their head  
I will plan to be a bum  
So I just might become someone

[Chorus]  
She asked me, "Son, when I grow old  
Will you buy me a house of gold?  
And when your father turns to stone  
Will you take care of me?"  
I will make you queen of everything you see  
I'll put you on the map  
I'll cure you of disease
