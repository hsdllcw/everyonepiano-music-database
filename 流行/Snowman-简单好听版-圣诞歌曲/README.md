### Snowman歌词：

Don't cry snowman not in front of me  
Who'll catch your tears if you can't catch me darling  
If you can't catch me darling  
Don't cry snowman don't leave me this way  
A puddle of water can't hold me close baby  
Can't hold me close baby  
I want you to know that I'm never leaving  
'Cause I'm Mrs. Snow 'til death we'll be freezing  
Yeah you are my home my home for all seasons  
So come on let's go  
Let's go below zero and hide from the sun  
I'll love you forever where we'll have some fun  
Yes let's hit the North Pole and live happily  
Please don't cry no tears now  
It's Christmas baby  
My snowman and me  
My snowman and me  
Baby  
Don't cry snowman don't you fear the sun  
Who'll carry me without legs to run honey  
Without legs to run honey  
Don't cry snowman don't you shed a tear  
Who'll hear my secrets if you don't have ears baby  
If you don't have ears baby  
I want you to know that I'm never leaving  
'Cause I'm Mrs. Snow 'til death we'll be freezing  
Yeah you are my home my home for all seasons  
So come on let's go  
Let's go below zero and hide from the sun  
I'll love you forever where we'll have some fun  
Yes let's hit the North Pole and live happily  
Please don't cry no tears now  
It's Christmas baby  
My snowman and me  
My snowman and me  
Baby
