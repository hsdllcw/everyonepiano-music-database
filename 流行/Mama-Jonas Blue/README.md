### Mama歌词：

Where should we run to?  
We got the world in our hands and we're ready to play  
They say we're wasted  
But how can we waste it if we're loving every day?  
Okay, I got the keys to the universe  
So stay with me 'cause I got the keys, baby  
Don't wanna wake up one day wishing that we done more  
I wanna live fast and never look back, that's what we here for  
Don't wanna wake up one day wondering where'd it all go  
Cause we'll be home before we know  
I wanna hear you sing it  
Hey, mama, don't stress your mind  
We coming home tonight  
Hey, mama, we gonna be alright  
Dry those eyes  
We'll be back in the morning when the sun stars to rise  
So mama, don't stress your mind  
So mama, don't stress your mind  
Mama, mama, mama, hey  
Mama, mama, mama, hey  
We coming home tonight  
Mama, mama, mama, hey  
We coming home tonight  
Where should be run to?  
We got a ticket that takes us wherever we like  
We got our problems  
But just for the minute, let's push all our troubles aside  
Alright 'cause we got the keys to the universe  
Inside our minds, yeah, we got the keys, baby  
Don't wanna wake up one day wishing that we done more  
I wanna live fast and never look back, that's what we here for  
Don't wanna wake up one day wondering where'd it all go  
Cause we'll be home before we know  
I wanna hear you sing it  
Hey, mama, don't stress your mind  
We coming home tonight  
Hey, mama, we gonna be alright  
Dry those eyes  
We'll be back in the morning when the sun stars to rise  
So mama, don't stress your mind  
So mama, don't stress your mind  
Hey, mama, don't stress your mind  
We coming home tonight  
Hey, mama, we gonna be alright  
Dry those eyes  
We'll be back in the morning when the sun stars to rise  
So mama, don't stress your mind  
So mama, don't stress your mind  
Mama, mama, mama, hey  
We coming home tonight  
Mama, mama, mama, hey  
We coming home tonight
