### No Goodbyes歌词：

Maybe one day I can see you  
We can smile and wave and it'll be okay  
Maybe one day it'll be cool  
We could just be friends without the complications that it brings  
When we start saying things  
Yeah I hurt you and you hurt me  
Yeah we did some things that we can never take back  
And we tried hard just to fix it  
But we broke it more  
And so I guess some things are not meant to last  
Is it too much to ask  
For tonight  
Let's love like there's no goodbyes no goodbyes  
Just for tonight  
Pretend that it's all alright all alright  
Why don't we hold each other use each other whisper pretty lies  
Just for tonight  
Let's love like there's no goodbyes no goodbyes  
No goodbyes  
No goodbyes  
No goodbyes eh  
In a dark room  
We don't have to see the light of truth between me and you  
We can stay blind in the meantime  
Let our bodies say what we can never seem to communicate  
Even though it's too late  
For tonight  
Let's love like there's no goodbyes no goodbyes  
Just for tonight  
Pretend that it's all alright all alright  
Why don't we hold each other use each other whisper pretty lies  
Just for tonight  
Let's love like there's no goodbyes no goodbyes  
No goodbyes  
No goodbyes  
No goodbyes eh  
No goodbyes  
No goodbyes  
No goodbyes  
No goodbyes  
No goodbyes eh  
Maybe one day I'll see you  
Just smile and wave and be okay  
For tonight  
Let's love like there's no goodbyes  
Just for tonight  
Pretend that it's all alright all alright  
Why don't we hold each other use each other whisper pretty lies  
Just for tonight  
Let's love like there's no goodbyes no goodbyes  
No goodbyes  
No goodbyes  
No goodbyes eh  
No goodbyes  
No goodbyes  
No goodbyes eh
