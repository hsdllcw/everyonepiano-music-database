### Reminds Me of You歌词：

The Kid LAROI：  
I can't play that song 'cause it reminds me of you  
I can't watch that show 'cause it reminds me of you  
I can't even go there it reminds me of you  
I don't wanna do that it reminds me of you  
Cut off all of my friends 'cause they remind me of you  
I can't drink again 'cause I'm reminded of you  
I don't wanna do s**t that reminds me of you  
Everything and everywhere reminds me of you  
I know we can't be together ever again  
You told me this forever I ain't know forever could end  
You had me f**ked up had me thinkin' I would die here for you  
S**t got me f**ked up can't believe I was so blinded by you  
But I don't wanna cry  
Got my finger on the trigger and I'm thinking 'bout a homicide  
I feel like I could die  
Maybe if it was all over I could have you in another life  
I can't play that song 'cause it reminds me of you  
I can't watch that show 'cause it reminds me of you  
I can't even go there it reminds me of you  
I don't wanna do that it reminds me of you  
Cut off all of my friends 'cause they remind me of you  
I can't drink again 'cause I'm reminded of you  
I don't wanna do s**t that reminds me of you  
Everything and everywhere reminds me of you  
Juice WRLD：  
Gotta step out get some fresh air  
Posted in the club saw you pull up with your rebound  
Remind me again uh who kicked who out whose house  
Remind me again uh who's f**kin' on who now  
Oh  
Fightin' for my heart and baby I never lose  
No I can't get high 'cause it reminds me of you  
If you ever needed me girl I was flyin' to you  
Told you that I loved you girl I wasn't lyin' to you  
Fightin' for my heart and baby I never lose  
No I can't get high 'cause it reminds me of you  
If you ever needed me girl I was flyin' to you  
Told you that I loved you girl I wasn't lyin' to you  
The Kid LAROI：  
I can't play that song 'cause it reminds me of you  
I can't watch that show 'cause it reminds me of you  
I can't even go there it reminds me of you  
I don't wanna do that it reminds me of you  
Cut off all of my friends 'cause they remind me of you  
I can't drink again 'cause I'm reminded of you  
I don't wanna do s**t that reminds me of you  
Everything and everywhere reminds me of you
