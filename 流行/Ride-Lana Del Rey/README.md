Ride_ 为美国独立音乐歌手、唱作人、歌曲创作人，全英音乐奖最佳女歌手Lana Del Rey的歌曲。歌曲MV再次由导演过Lana Del
Rey另一大热单曲《National Anthem》MV的美国著名导演Anthony Mandler（代表作Taylor Swift《I Knew You
Were Trouble》Rihanna《California King Bed》）掌镜，长达10分09秒。MV的创意部分全部来自Del
Rey本人。MV从最开始Del
Rey骑在悬挂于荒漠的轮胎上就饱受争议（如此广阔的荒漠根本没有能够悬挂轮胎的地方），而有人对此MV传达出的信息表示不满，认为Del
Rey是在塑造一个通过出卖肉体来寻求安全感与自由的女性角色，尤其在MV最后一句“I 'm fucking crazy but I 'm
free.”充满对女权主义的反抗意味。

### Ride歌词：

I've been out on that open road  
You can be my full time, daddy  
White and gold  
Singing blues has been getting old  
You can be my full time, baby  
Hot or cold  
Don't break me down  
I've been traveling too long  
I've been trying too hard  
With one pretty song  
I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast  
I am alone in midnight  
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I  
I got a war in my mind  
So, I just ride, I just ride  
I just ride, I just ride  
Dying young and I'm playing hard  
That's the way my father made his life an art  
Drink all day and we talk 'til dark  
That's the way the road dogs do it, ride 'til dark  
Don't leave me now  
Don't say goodbye  
Don't turn around  
Leave me high and dry  
I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast  
I am alone in the night  
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I  
I've got a war in my mind  
I just ride, I just ride  
I just ride, I just ride  
I'm tired of feeling like I'm f*cking crazy  
I'm tired of driving 'til I see stars in my eyes  
All I got to keep myself sane, baby  
So I just ride, I just ride  
I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast  
I am alone in the night  
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I  
I got a war in my mind  
I just ride, I just ride  
I just ride, I just ride
