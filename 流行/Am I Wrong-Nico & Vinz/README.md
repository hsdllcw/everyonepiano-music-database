### Am I Wrong歌词：

Am I wrong for thinking out the box from where I stay?  
是否我该安于现状 不该想入非非  
Am I wrong for saying that I'll choose another way?  
是否我不该宣告我的与众不同  
I ain't trying to do what everybody else doing  
不想与他人一样人云亦云  
Just cause everybody doing what they all do  
只是因为大家都那样做  
If one thing I know, how far would I grow?  
只想知道一件事 我的极限在哪  
I'm walking down this road of mine, this road that I call home  
我要走属于自己的路 这才是我的归宿  
So am I wrong for thinking that we could be something for real?  
是否我不该想什么才是真实  
Now am I wrong for trying to reach the things that I can't see?  
是否我不能奢求那些我看不见的事  
But that's just how I feel, that's just how I feel  
但这才是我的感受 真实的我  
That's just how I feel trying to reach the things that I can't see  
我就是想追求那些看起来不可能的梦想  
Am I tripping for having ambition?  
是我陷入了雄心壮志了吗  
My prediction; I'mma be on the top of the world  
我的梦想中我站在世界之巅  
Hope you, hope you don't look back,always do what you decide  
希望你也不要瞻前顾后 坚持你的决定  
Don't let them control your life,that's just how I feel  
不要让别人掌控你的生活 这才是我要的  
Fight for yours and don't let go,don't let them compare you, no  
为梦想奋斗 不退缩 不委屈求全 绝不  
Don't worry, you're not alone,that's just how we feel  
别担心 你不是一个人 我们一起奋争
