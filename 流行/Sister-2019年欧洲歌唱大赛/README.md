### Sister歌词：

I'm tired tired of always losing  
I tried to stop your fire  
Turns out that I couldn't  
I'm tired tired of competing  
I tried to hold you under  
But honey you kept breathing  
When you said you wanted the world  
I said you couldn't too  
You were walking right beside me  
But I left no room for you  
Calling you my enemy but my enemy's right here  
It was my mistake to try and break  
That power that I feared  
I see flames in your eyes  
D**n they burn so bright  
Oh you gotta know I'm with ya  
Now shine like city lights  
Torches in the sky  
Don't you try to hide it  
Sister  
I'm sorry sorry for the drama  
I tried to steal your thunder  
Turns out I don't wanna  
When you said you wanted the world  
I said you couldn't too  
You were walking right beside me  
But I left no room for you  
Calling you my enemy but my enemy's right here  
It was my mistake to try and break  
Your power that I feared  
I see flames in your eyes  
D**n they burn so bright  
Don't you try to hide it  
Sister sister sister  
Don't you try to hide it  
Sister sister sister  
Don't you try to hide it  
I see flames in your eyes  
D**n they burn so bright  
Oh you gotta know I'm with ya  
Now shine like city lights  
Torches in the sky  
Don't you try to hide it  
Don't you try to hide it  
Sister
