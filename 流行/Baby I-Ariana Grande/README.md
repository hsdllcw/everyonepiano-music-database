**Baby I** 是美国歌手Ariana Grande即将到来的首张专辑Yours
Truly的一首歌，这是第一次由布劳恩在MTV的采访证实的。布劳恩补充说，“ _Baby I_
是她在首张在专辑中最喜欢的歌，感觉良好的歌曲。这貌似是写给她男友Jai Brooks的，也有可能是为了写出很多人热恋中的心声。”

歌曲十分上口动听，歌词真实，使人感同身受。

### Baby I歌词：

Baby, I got love for thee  
So deep inside of me  
I don't know where to start  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
I love you more than anything  
But the words can't even touch what's in my heart  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
No, no  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

When I try to explain it I be sounding insane  
The words don't ever come out right  
I get all tongue-tied and twisted  
I can't explain what I'm feeling  
And I say, baby, baby,  
Oh, woah, oh, woah,  
Baby, baby

(Baby I) oh, baby, oh, baby, my baby  
(Baby I) oh, baby, baby I  
(Baby I) all I'm tryna say is you're my everything, baby  
But every time I try to say it  
Words, they only complicate it  
Baby, baby (oh, whoa, oh, whoa)

Baby, I'm so down for you  
No matter what you do (real talk), I'll be around  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,)  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Oh, baby  
See Baby, I been feelin' you  
Before I even knew what feelings were about  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,)  
Oh, baby  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

When I try to explain it I be sounding all crazy  
Words don't ever come out right  
I get all tongue-tied and twisted  
I can't explain what I'm feeling  
And I say Baby, baby (oh, whoa, oh, whoa)  
Baby

(Baby I) oh, baby, oh, baby, my baby  
(Baby I) oh, baby, baby I  
(Baby I) all I'm tryna say is you're my everything (baby)  
But every time I try to say it  
Words, they only complicate it  
Baby, baby (oh, whoa, oh, whoa)  
Baby, baby

Straight up you got me  
All in, how could I not be,  
I sure hope you know (I sure hope you know)  
If it's even possible, I love you more  
Than the word love can say it (say it)  
It's better not explaining  
That's why I keep saying...

(Baby I) oh, baby, oh, baby, my baby  
(Baby I) oh, baby, baby I  
(Baby I) all I'm tryna say is you're my everything, baby  
But every time I try to say it  
Words, they only complicate it  
Baby, baby (oh, whoa, oh, whoa)  
Baby, baby

(Baby I) oh, baby, oh, baby, my baby  
(Baby I) oh, baby, baby I  
(Baby I) all I'm tryna say is you're my everything, baby  
But every time I try to say it  
Words, they only complicate it  
Every time I try to say it  
Words, they only complicate it  
Every time I try to say it  
Words, they only complicate it  
Baby, baby (oh, whoa, oh, whoa)  
Baby, baby
