**California** 是美国女歌手Lana Del Rey演唱的歌曲，收录在其第六张录音室专辑Norman Fucking Rockwell!。

这首歌是写给前男友Barrie的，延续着和Barrie一起制作超暴力ultra
violence时的风格。此首情歌不仅不丧，反而会激发人们对恋爱的渴望。字里行间的那种纯粹、热忱、沉醉，让人看到了一个鲜活、有趣、可爱的女友形象。可以说Lana真正写出了爱情，唱出了爱情。

### California歌词：

One two three four  
You don't ever have to be stronger than you really are  
When you're lying in my arms baby  
You don't ever have to go faster than your fastest pace  
Or faster than my fastest cars  
I shouldn't have done it but I read it in your letter  
You said to a friend that you wish you were doing better  
I wanted to reach out but I never said a thing  
I shouldn't have done it but I read it in your letter  
You said to a friend that you wish you were doing better  
I wanted to call you but I didn't say a thing  
Two three four  
Oh I'll pick you up  
If you come back to America just hit me up  
'Cause this is crazy love I'll catch you on the flipside  
If you come back to California you should just hit me up  
We'll do whatever you want travel wherever how far  
We'll hit up all the old places  
We'll have a party we'll dance 'til dawn  
I'll pick up all of your folks and all of your Rolling Stones  
Your favorite liquor off the top shelf  
I'll throw a party all night long  
You don't ever have to be stronger than you really are  
When you're lying in my arms and honey  
You don't ever have to act cooler than you think you should  
You're brighter than the brightest stars  
You're scared to win scared to lose  
I've heard the war was over if you really choose  
The one in and around you  
You hate the heat you got the blues  
Changing like the weather oh that's so like you  
The Santa Ana moves you  
Two three four  
Oh I'll pick you up  
If you come back to America just hit me up  
'Cause this is crazy love I'll catch you on the flipside  
If you come back to California you should just hit me up  
We'll do whatever you want travel wherever how far  
We'll hit up all the old places  
We'll have a party we'll dance 'til dawn  
I'll pick up all of your folks and all of your Rolling Stones  
Your favorite liquor off the top shelf  
I'll throw a party all night long  
Oh I'll pick you up  
If you come back to America just hit me up  
'Cause this is crazy love I'll catch you on the flipside  
If you come back to California you should just hit me up
