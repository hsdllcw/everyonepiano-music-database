### Best Mistake歌词：

[Verse 1:Ariana Grande]  
As soon as we forget how we felt  
Dealing with emotions that never left  
Playing with the hand that we were dealt in this game  
Maybe I*m the sinner,and not a siant  
Gotta stop pretending what we ain*t  
Why we pointing fingers anyway?  
We*re all the same  
[Pre-Chorus:Ariana Grande]  
Break up,make up  
Total waste of time  
Can we please make up our minds?  
And stop acting like we*re blind  
Cause if the water dries up  
And the moon stops shining  
Stars fall,and the world goes blind  
Boy you know I*ll be savin* my love for you,for you  
[Chorus:Ariana Grande]  
Cause you*re the best mistake I*ve ever made  
But we hold on,hold on  
There*s no pot of god at the rainbow,sweet Jesus  
But we*re holding on,hold on  
[Verse 2:Big Sean]  
I guess times wasting,tick tocking lip locking  
How can we keep the feelings fresh how do we zip lock them  
Wear your heart up on your sleeves so watch for pickpockets  
I guess to go the distance we might need to pit stop it  
Hold on,hold love,I know love can be a beach with no shore  
I done count to ten lost my temper and went back to four  
I know sometimes it*s hard to realize I*m the man that you need  
I had a dream we branched out started a family tree  
And I feel like everything we do is overdue  
You asked why I love your mom so much *cause she*s an older you  
I wish that you were happy  
I guess that*s the one thing I should be providing  
Ain*t no number twos we both ones and ones* the oddest  
Couple only human except you,you a goddess  
Only lying to you when I lie you down,just being honest  
When you start as friends it*s hart to say you*re never going back  
If I*m not the one then I*m the best mistake you ever had  
[Pre-Chorus:Ariana Grande]  
Break up,make up  
Total waste of time  
Can we please make up our minds?  
And stop acting like we*re blind  
Cause if the water dries up  
And the moon stops shining  
Stars fall,and the world goes blind  
Boy you know I*ll be savin* my love for you,for you  
[Chorus:Ariana Grande]  
Cause you*re the best mistake I*ve ever made  
But we hold on,hold on  
There*s no pot of god at the rainbow,sweet Jesus  
But we*re holding on,hold on  
[Outro:Ariana Grande(Big Sean)]  
You*re,you*re,you*re  
(Best mistake you ever had,best mistake you ever had)  
I be savin* my love for you,for you  
You*re,you*re,you*re  
(Best mistake you ever had,best mistake you ever had)  
I be savin* my love for you,for you
