_Forever_ 是英国歌手Lewis Capaldi演唱的歌曲。收录在其首张专辑《Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish
Extent》中。且该专辑占据英国专辑榜榜首长达6周。另外，专辑中直白大胆“谈情说爱”，语调悲伤舒缓而高亢，围绕分手故事的音乐笔触虽与浪漫甜蜜“不合时宜”，却更表达出他对复杂情感世界的坦诚和理解。

### Forever歌词：

Caught me off guard I wish that I'd been sober  
Still here we are back in Hanover 99  
Just like old times all over  
Under the exit lights as beautiful as ever  
I really wish that I dressed up a little better  
No regrets is what we said  
We can't go back again  
Darling nobody said that it would last forever  
That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there  
I never said that we would die together  
That doesn't mean it was a lie  
Remember nobody said that it would last forever  
Head in my hands cold coffee on the table  
Wish you the best I would if I was able  
Morning light it stings a little  
Out of my mind I don't remember calling  
Had too much tonic wine sometimes it does the talking  
Hope you know I wish you all the love you're looking for  
Darling nobody said that it would last forever  
That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there  
I never said that we would die together  
That doesn't mean it was a lie  
Remember nobody said that it would last forever  
Forever  
Forever  
Forever  
Nobody said that it would last forever  
That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there  
I never said that we would die together  
That doesn't mean it was a lie  
They'll never take those long summer days  
When love was untamed  
Two burning hearts are dared to break  
Remember nobody said that it would last forever
