**Shut Up双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Shut Up_ 出自美国女歌手Ariana Grande的第六张录音室专辑Positions。专辑以不言自明的《Shut
Up》开始，混合了优美动听的弦乐和劝戒的歌词，如“你知道你听起来很笨”和“你怎么利用你的时间，你如此担心我的时间”，然后以一种颓废的、舞会灰姑娘式的结尾达到高潮。

同时，网站还为大家提供了《[ **Just Like Magic**](Music-12277-Just-Like-Magic-Ariana-

### Shut Up歌词：

My presence sweet and my aura bright  
Diamonds cut for my appetite  
Guess it f**kin' just clicked one night  
All them demons help me see s**t differently  
So don't be sad for me  
How you be spending your time  
Huh  
How you be using your time  
Huh  
You be so worried 'bout mine  
Huh  
Can't even get yourself mine  
You know you sound so dumb  
So dumb so dumb  
You know you sound so dumb  
So dumb  
So maybe you should shut up  
Maybe you should shut up  
Say  
If only you would shut up  
Yeah that's right you should  
Shut up  
I vibe real high and my circle lit  
We ain't really withdraws and s**t  
Let her game so I never miss  
Keep on being snooty for the hell of it  
'Cause I like my s**t  
How you be spending your time  
Huh  
How you be using your time  
Huh  
You be so worried 'bout mine  
Huh  
Can't even get yourself mine  
You know you sound so dumb  
So dumb so dumb  
You know you sound so dumb  
So dumb  
So maybe you should shut up  
Maybe you should shut up  
Say  
If only you would shut up  
Yeah that's right you should  
Shut up
