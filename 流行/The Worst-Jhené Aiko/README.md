The Worst歌词：

But I love you

Tell me what you say now  
Tell me what you say Come again  
If you cannot stay down  
Then you do not have to pretend  
Like there is no way out  
I shoulda never let you in  
Cause you got me fazed out  
And don't take this personal  
But you're the worst  
You know what you've done to me  
And although it hurts I know  
I just can't keep runnin' away  
I don't need you I don't need you  
I don't need you I don't need you  
But I want you  
I don't mean to I don't mean to  
I don't mean to I don't mean to  
But I love you  
Tell me what you say now  
Tell me what you say  
You said that you would come again  
You said that we would remain friends but  
You know that I do not depend on  
Nothing or no one  
So why would you show up  
So uninvited then  
Just change my mind like that  
Please don't take this personal  
But you ain't shit  
And you weren't special  
Til I made you so  
You better act like you know  
That I've been through worse than you  
I just can't keep running away  
But I don't need you  
I don't need you I don't need you  
I don't need you I don't need you  
But I want you But I want you  
I don't mean to I don't mean to  
I don't mean to I don't mean to  
But I love you  
Everybody's like  
He's no item  
Please don't like em  
He don't wife em  
He one nights em  
I never listened  
No  
I shoulda figured though  
All that shit you was spittin'  
So unoriginal  
But it was you  
So I was with it  
Then tell you the truth  
Wish we never did it  
Cause I usually do  
Stick to the business  
But you came out the blue  
And then you just flipped it  
God damn baby  
My mind's blown  
Be forgettin'  
You live in a different time zone  
Think I know what this is  
It's just the time's wrong  
Yeah I know what you did  
But baby I'm grown  
And my love is patient  
And kind and shit  
This is real we can build  
Through different types of shit  
If you was really the realest  
Wouldn't be fightin' it  
I think your pride is just  
In the way  
Funny how everything changed  
Once you got all that you wanted  
Nothing was ever the same  
And though  
I don't need you I don't need you  
I don't need you I don't need you  
I still want you  
I don't mean to I don't mean to  
I don't mean to I don't mean to  
But I love you  
But I love you  
I don't need you I don't need you  
I don't need you I don't need you  
But I want you  
I don't mean to I don't mean to  
I don't mean to I don't mean to
