**It's Time to Go** 是由Taylor Swift录唱的一首歌曲，收录在她的第九张录音室专辑《Evermore》中。

这首歌曲讲述的是Taylor的亲身经历。在以前，一个身边最好的朋友为了利益而背叛了她，与她的仇人成为朋友以及前六张专辑音乐版权归属到欺凌她的人手中的故事。“人走茶凉，曲终人散；了结清算，故伎重演，挚友相称；真诚相待，同情姐妹仅是镜花水月，原形毕露，跳梁小丑才是她的本貌。”一切最终随风释然，用心倾听Taylor在歌曲中为大家流露自己另一面细腻温柔的情感。

### It's Time to Go歌词：

When your dinner is cold and the chatter gets old  
You ask for the tab  
Or that moment again he's insisting that friends  
Look at each other like that  
When the words of a sister come back in whispers  
That prove she was not in fact what she seemed  
Not a twin from your dreams  
She's a crook who was caught  
That old familiar body ache  
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul  
You know when it's time to go  
Twenty years at your job  
Then the son of the boss gets the spot that was yours  
Or trying to stay for the kids  
When keeping it how it is will only break their hearts worse  
That old familiar body ache  
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul  
You know when it's time to go  
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing  
Sometimes to run is the brave thing  
Sometimes walking out is the one thing  
That will find you the right thing  
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing  
Sometimes to run is the brave thing  
Sometimes walking out is the one thing  
That will find you the right thing  
Fifteen years fifteen million tears  
Begging 'til my knees bled  
I gave it my all he gave me nothing at all  
Then wondered why I left  
Now he sits on his throne in his palace of bones  
Praying to his greed  
He's got my past frozen behind glass  
But I've got me  
That old familiar body ache  
The snaps from the same little breaks in my soul  
I know when it's time to go  
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing  
Sometimes to run is the brave thing  
Sometimes walking out is the one thing  
That will find you the right thing  
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing  
Sometimes to run is the brave thing  
Sometimes walking out is the one thing  
That will find you the right thing  
That will find you the right thing  
And you know in your soul  
And you know in your soul  
When it's time to go  
You know you know you know you know  
When it's time to go  
So then you go  
Then you go  
You just go
