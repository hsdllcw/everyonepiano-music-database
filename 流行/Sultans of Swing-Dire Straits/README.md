**Sultans of Swing** 是英国摇滚乐队Dire Straits所演唱的歌曲。该乐队于1976 年组建于伦敦西南部的代特福德，活跃于1977
至1995年期间。他们的成功主要应归于吉他演奏大师、乐队的核心人物 Mark Knopfler（生于1949 年8 月12 日）。Knopfler 29
岁时才开始音乐生涯，此前他曾做过新闻记者和教师。他吸收了许多音乐，在组建乐队之时，在歌曲创作和吉他演奏上已臻成熟。  
  
Knopfler 与他的兄弟 David（吉他手）和 John Illsley（贝司手）联合以后，鼓手 Pick Withers
又加入到乐队中，他们开始在伦敦的酒吧中举办一些小型演出。最后他们花了 120 英镑录制了一盘样带，其中包括后来成为经典的歌曲“ _Sultans Of
Swing_ ”，这首歌在伦敦电台节目中播放后，各唱片公司蜂拥而至竞相与该乐队签约。

### Sultans of Swing歌词：

You get a shiver in the dark  
It's raining in the park but meantime  
South of the river you stop and you hold everything  
A band is blowing Dixie double four time  
You feel alright when you hear that music ring

You step inside but you don't see too many faces  
Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down  
Too much competition too many other places  
But not too many horns can make that sound  
Way on down south way on down south London town

You check out Guitar George he knows all the chords  
Mind he's strictly rhythm he doesn't want to make it cry or sing  
And an old guitar is all he can afford  
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene  
He's got a daytime job he's doing alright  
He can play honky tonk just like anything  
Saving it up for Friday night  
With the Sultans with the Sultans of Swing

And a crowd of young boys they're fooling around in the corner  
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles  
The don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band  
It ain't what they call rock and roll  
And the Sultans played Creole

And then the man he steps right up to the microphone  
And says at last just as the time bell rings  
'Thank you goodnight now it's time to go home'  
And he makes it fast with one more thing  
'We are the Sultans of Swing'
