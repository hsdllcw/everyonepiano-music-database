### Nobody Not Really歌词：

Who really cares?  
When I talk?  
What I feel?  
What I say?  
Nobody, not really  
Who wants to take  
The time to understand?  
I would like  
Someone to heal me with some empathy  
But I can't find  
Nobody, not really  
Maybe I'm invisible to the world  
Does anyone on the world even think of me  
As more than just a hopeless cause  
Maybe the world is not my block  
My stoop  
My life, my dreams  
My anything  
So, who wants to help?  
Momma but she's so tired  
Papa but you're not here  
I'm alone in a big empty space with  
Nobody, not really
