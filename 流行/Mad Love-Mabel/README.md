### Mad Love歌词：

Boy, you're lookin' like my type  
But tell me, can you hit it right?  
'Cause if I let you in tonight  
You better put it da-da-down da-da-down  
Now we do without the talk  
I ain't playin' any more  
You heard me when I said before  
You better put it da-da-down da-da-down  
Make me say you the one I like, like, like, like  
Come put your body on mine, mine, mine, mine  
Keep it up all night, night, night, night  
Don't let me down da-da-down  
All night give me mad love  
All night give me mad love  
All night give me mad love  
Yeah, don't let me down da-da-down  
All night give me mad love  
All night give me mad love  
All night give me mad love  
Yeah, don't let me down da-da-down  
Yo, come over, we can chill  
Tell each other how we feel  
But, baby, know I love the thrill  
When you put it da-da-down da-da-down  
I'm alright on my own  
But with you I'm in the zone  
One shot, don't let it go  
You better put it da-da-down da-da-down  
Make me say you the one I like, like, like, like  
Come put your body on mine, mine, mine, mine  
Keep it up all night, night, night, night  
Don't let me down da-da-down  
All night give me mad love  
All night give me mad love  
All night give me mad love  
Yeah, don't let me down da-da-down  
All night give me mad love  
All night give me mad love  
All night give me mad love  
Yeah, don't let me down da-da-down  
If I back up, can you handle?  
Get it all night, give me mad love  
Don't be too nice, feel the mad love  
Now don't let me down da-da-down  
If I back up, can you handle?  
Get it all night, give me mad love  
Don't be too nice, feel the mad love  
Now don't let me down da-da-down  
All night give me mad love  
All night give me mad love  
All night give me mad love  
Yeah, don't let me down da-da-down  
All night give me mad love  
All night give me mad love  
All night give me mad love  
Yeah, don't let me down da-da-down  
Make me say you the one I like, like, like, like  
Come put your body on mine, mine, mine, mine  
Keep it up all night, night, night, night  
Don't let me down da-da-down  
If I back up, can you handle?  
Get it all night, give me mad love  
Don't be too nice, feel the mad love  
Yeah, don't let me down da-da-down
