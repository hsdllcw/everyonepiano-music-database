boy是来自芝加哥的一个乐队，组建于2001年，曾获格莱美提名。充满年轻活力朝气，畅快将庞克的不羁气焰完全释放，些许EMO风格夹带流畅声线， Fall
Out Boy虽然和时下偶像团体般，在团名中加入个"Boy"字眼，但是，他们可完全不按牌理出牌，踢爆时下做作男孩偶像团体的面具，给你最热血的新世代之音！

### The Phoenix歌词：

Put on your war paint  
You are a brick tied to me that's dragging me down  
Strike a match and I'll burn you to the ground  
We are the jack-o-lanterns in July  
Setting fire to the sky  
Here, here comes this rising tide  
So come on  
Put on your war paint  
Cross walks and crossed hearts and hope-to-dies  
Silver clouds with grey linings  
So we can take the world back from a heart attack  
One maniac at a time we will take it back  
You know time crawls on when you're waiting for the song to start  
So dance alone to the beat of your heart  
Hey! young blood!  
Doesn't it feel like our time is running out?  
I'm gonna change you like a remix  
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix  
Wearing our vintage misery  
No, I think it looked a little better on me  
I'm gonna change you like a remix  
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix  
Bring home the boys and scrap scrap metal the tanks  
Get hitched, make a career out of robbing banks  
Because the world is just a teller and we are wearing black masks  
"You broke our spirit," says the note we pass  
So we can take the world back from a heart attack  
One maniac at a time we will take it back  
You know time crawls on when you're waiting for the song to start  
So dance alone to the beat of your heart  
Hey! young blood!  
Doesn't it feel like our time is running out?  
I'm gonna change you like a remix  
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix  
Wearing our vintage misery  
No, I think it looked a little better on me  
I'm gonna change you like a remix  
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix  
Put on your war paint  
The war is won, before it's begun  
Release the doves, surrender love  
The war is won, before it's begun  
Release the doves, surrender love  
The war is won, before it's begun  
Release the doves, surrender love (Wave the white flag!)  
The war is won, before it's begun (Wave the white flag!)  
Release the doves, surrender love (Wave the white flag!)  
Heyyyyyyyy  
Young Bllood!  
Doesn't it feel like our time is running out?  
I'm gonna change you like a remix  
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix  
Wearing our vintage misery  
No, I think it looked a little better on me  
I'm gonna change you like a remix  
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix  
Hey! young blood!  
Doesn't it feel like our time is running out?  
I'm gonna change you like a remix  
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix  
Put on your war paint
