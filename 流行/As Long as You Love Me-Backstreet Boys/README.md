### As Long as You Love Me歌词：

Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine  
I'm leaving my life in your hands  
虽然早已习惯孤独形影相伴  
我把自己交你掌管  
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind  
Risking it all in a glance  
人们说我被感情冲昏了脑袋  
竟转眼间赌上未来  
How you got me blind is still a mystery  
I can't get you out of my head  
你怎会让我不顾一切还是个谜  
我就是无法忘了你  
Don't care what is written in your history  
As long as you're here with me  
我不在乎你有过怎样的经历  
只要你和我在一起  
I don't care who you are, where you're from, what you did  
As long as you love me  
我不管你是谁，从哪来，做过什么  
我只要你爱我  
Who you are, where you're from, don't care what you did  
As long as you love me  
你是谁，从哪来，做过什么我都不在乎  
我只要你爱我  
Every little thing that you've said and done  
Feels like it's deep within me  
你说过做过的那些点点滴滴  
都深深印在我心里  
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run  
It seems like we're meant to be  
即使你行色匆匆也没有关系  
我们似乎命中注定  
I don't care who you are, where you're from, what you did  
As long as you love me  
我不管你是谁，从哪来，做过什么  
我只要你爱我  
Who you are, where you're from, don't care what you did  
As long as you love me  
你是谁，从哪来，做过什么我都不在乎  
我只要你爱我  
As long as you love me  
我只要你爱我  
I've tried to hide it so that no one knows  
But I guess it shows, when you look into my eyes  
我设法把感情隐藏起来不让人看透  
但恐怕我无法不流露，当你凝视着我  
What you did and where you're coming from, I don't care  
As long as you love me, baby  
你做过什么又从哪里来，我都不在乎  
只要你爱我就好，宝贝  
I don't care who you are, where you're from, what you did  
As long as you love me  
我不管你是谁，从哪来，做过什么  
我只要你爱我  
Who you are, where you're from, don't care what you did  
As long as you love me  
你是谁，从哪来，做过什么我都不在乎  
我只要你爱我  
Who you are, where you're from, what you did  
As long as you love me  
你是谁，从哪来，做过什么  
我只要你爱我  
Who you are, where you're from  
As long as you love me  
你是谁，你从哪里来  
只要你爱我  
Who you are  
As long as you love me  
你是谁  
只要你爱我  
What you did  
I don't care  
你做过什么  
我都不在乎  
As long as you love me  
我只要你爱我
