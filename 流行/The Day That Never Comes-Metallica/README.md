《 **The Day That Never Comes** 》是美国重金属乐队Metallica的歌曲，收录于专辑《Death Magnetic》。

  

二十世纪八十年代后期，欧美摇滚乐坛上“重金属”音乐正在鼎盛时期，而此时出现的Thrash
Metal（激流金属）象一股洪流一样冲击着乐坛。这种流派的创始者就是1981年在美国洛杉矶组建的金属乐队Metallica（金属乐队）Metallica无疑是从上世纪80年代至今世界上最杰出和最有影响力的重金属乐队。乐队的一大贡献在于扩展了传统鞭笞金属的含义，从Metallica开始，复杂的编曲和大量华丽的吉他独奏也同样属于Thrash
Metal。这种风格加上James Hetfield那极富冲击力的演唱，使Metallica长期处于重金属的统治地位。

The Day That Never Comes歌词：

  
Born to push you around  
Better just stay down  
  
You put away  
He hit's the flesh  
You hit the ground  
Mouth so full of lies  
Tend to black your eyes  
  
Just keep them closed  
Keep praying just keep waiting  
  
Waiting for the one  
The day that never comes  
When you stand up and feel the warmth  
But the sunshine never comes  
  
No the sunshine never comes  
  
Pushed you across that line  
Just stay down this time  
  
Hide in yourself  
Crawl in yourself  
You'll have your time  
  
God I'll make them pay  
Take you back one day  
I'll end this day  
I'll splatter color on this gray  
  
Waiting for the one  
The day that never comes  
When you stand up and feel the warmth  
But the sunshine never comes  
  
Love is a fallen word  
And never spoken here  
Love is a fallen word  
Here in this prison  
  
I suffer this no longer  
I'll put an end to  
This i swear This i swear  
  
The sun will shine  
This i swear This i swear  
This i swear
