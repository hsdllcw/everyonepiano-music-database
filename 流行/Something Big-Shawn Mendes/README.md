### Something Big歌词：

Oh, whoa, oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh
oh oh  
Play the lotto you might win it.  
It's like 25 to life so you bust out of prison.  
Something's in the air, something's in the air  
It's like that feeling when you're just about to kill it,  
Take your last shot you know you're gonna hit it.  
Something's in the air, something's in the air  
Whoa oh oh oh oh  
Something big I feel it happening  
Out of my control  
Pushing, pulling, and it's grabbing me,  
Feel it in my bones like  
Whoa oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh  
Something big I feel it happening  
Oh whoa oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh  
Something big  
It's like that feeling when you're 'bout to win the medal,  
And you worked so hard that you knew you wouldn't settle,  
Hands are in the air, hands are in the air.  
When they hear you when you thought they wouldn't listen,  
It's like an anthem that the whole world's singing,  
Hands are in the air, hands are in the air.  
Whoa oh oh oh oh  
Something big I feel it happening  
Out of my control,  
Pushing, pulling, and it's grabbing me,  
Feel it in my bones like,  
Oh whoa oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh whoa. Oh oh oh oh  
Something big I feel it happening  
Oh whoa oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh whoa. Oh oh oh oh  
Something big  
Whoa  
Yeah, yeah  
If we stomp our feet,  
The ground will shake  
If we clap our hands,  
The walls will break  
Yell so loud won't forget our names  
'Cause something big is happening  
Take this spark  
And start a fire  
Raise this up  
We're feeling high  
They can't tell us anything  
'Cause something big is happening  
Something big I feel it happening  
Out of my control  
Pushing, pulling, and it's grabbing me,  
Feel it in my bones like  
Oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Something big is happening whoa  
Oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Something big I feel it happening oh
