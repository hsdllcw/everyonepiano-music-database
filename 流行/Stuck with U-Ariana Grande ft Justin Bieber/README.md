### Stuck with U歌词：

Ariana Grande：  
Mmm  
Hey yeah  
That's just for fun  
What  
Ariana Grande：  
I'm not one to stick around  
One strike and you're out baby  
Don't care if I sound crazy  
But you never let me down  
No no  
That's why when the sun's up I'm stayin'  
Still layin' in your bed sayin'  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Got all this time on our hands  
Might as well cancel our plans ah  
I could stay here for a lifetime  
So lock the door and throw out the key  
Can't fight this no more  
It's just you and me  
And there's nothin' I nothin' I I can do  
I'm stuck with you stuck with you stuck with you  
So go ahead and drive me insane  
Baby run your mouth I still wouldn't change  
Being stuck with you stuck with you stuck with you  
I'm stuck with you stuck with you stuck with you baby  
Justin Bieber：  
There's nowhere we need to be  
No no no  
I'ma get to know you better  
Kinda hope we're here forever  
There's nobody on these streets  
If you told me that the world's endin'  
Ain't no other way that I can spend it  
Justin Bieber/Ariana Grande：  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Got all this time in my hands  
Might as well cancel our plans  
I could stay here forever  
Justin Bieber/Ariana Grande：  
So lock the door and throw out the key  
Can't fight this no more  
It's just you and me  
And there's nothin' I nothin' I I can do  
I'm stuck with you stuck with you stuck with you  
So go ahead and drive me insane  
Baby run your mouth I still wouldn't change  
Being stuck with you stuck with you stuck with you  
I'm stuck with you stuck with you stuck with you  
Justin Bieber/Ariana Grande：  
Oh oh oh oh  
Baby come take all my time  
Go on make me lose my mind  
We got all that we need here tonight  
Ariana Grande/Justin Bieber：  
I lock the door  
Lock the door  
And throw out the key  
Can't fight this no more  
Can't fight this no more  
It's just you and me  
And there's nothin' I nothin' I'd rather do  
I'm stuck with you stuck with you stuck with you  
So go ahead and drive me insane  
Baby run your mouth I still wouldn't change  
All this lovin' you hatin' you wantin' you  
I'm stuck with you stuck with you stuck with you  
Ariana Grande：  
Stuck with you stuck with you stuck with you
