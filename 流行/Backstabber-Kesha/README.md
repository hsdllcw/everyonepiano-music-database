### Backstabber歌词：

Backstabber [repeat 3x]

Bored, stoned, sitting in your basement  
All alone, cause your little conversations  
Got around, now look here what we all found out  
(look here what we found, look here we all found out)

That you have got a set of loose lips, twisting stories  
All because you're jealous  
Now I know exactly what you're all about  
So this is what you're all about

Girl, your such a backstabber  
Oh girl, you're such a shit talker  
And everybody knows it (everybody knows it)

Girl, your such a backstabber,  
Run your mouth more than everyone I've ever known  
And everybody knows it (everybody knows it)

Backstabber  
(Talk talk talk talk talk talk)

I'm sick and tired of hearing all about my life  
From other bitches with all of your lies  
Wrapped up so tight, so maybe you should shut your mouth, shut your mouth  
Shut your fucking mouth

Honestly, I think it's kinda funny that you waste  
Your breath talking about me  
Got me feeling kinda special really (so this is what your all about)

Girl, your such a backstabber  
Oh girl, you're such a shit talker  
And everybody knows it (everybody knows it)

Girl, your such a backstabber,  
Run your mouth more than everyone I've ever known  
And everybody knows it (everybody knows it)

Katie's to the left there just there ripping my style  
Damn, Jeanie why you gotta tell the secrets about my sex life?  
All I ever did was drive your broke ass around  
Pick you up, take you out  
When your car broke down

Backstabber [3x]

Girl, your such a backstabber  
Oh girl, you're such a shit talker  
And everybody knows it (everybody knows it)

Girl, your such a backstabber  
(Taking and twisting and telling, so manipulative)  
Run your mouth more than everyone I've ever known  
And everybody knows it (everybody knows it)

(Talk talk talk)  
Backstabber  
(Taking and twisting and telling, so manipulative)  
Oh girl uhu, you're looking like a lunatic  
Everybody knows it (everybody knows it)

Everybody knows  
Yeah you're looking like a lunatic  
And everybody knows  
Yeah everybody knows  
Backstabber
