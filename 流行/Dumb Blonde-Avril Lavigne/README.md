### Dumb Blonde歌词：

I ain't no dumb blonde  
I ain't no stupid Barbie doll  
I got my game on  
Watch me watch me watch me prove you wrong  
Well there you go again tellin' me where I belong  
You put me on the bench don't think that I can play strong  
So quick to condescend well you think I'm empty I'm not  
You won't be so confident when I'm crushin' you from the top Oh  
I'm a babe I'm a boss and I'm makin' this money Uh-huh  
I can flip like a switch and I cut like a blade Try to get it now  
I can sting like a bee but I'm sweeter than honey Uh-huh  
And I'm quick as a whip so get outta my way Come and get it now  
I ain't no dumb blonde  
I ain't no stupid Barbie doll  
I got my game on  
Watch me watch me watch me prove you wrong  
I ain't no dumb blonde  
I am a freaking cherry bomb  
I'll be your icon  
Watch me watch me watch me prove you wrong  
Stand up everybody  
Get up say it loud  
We're bombshells raisin' hell now  
Watch me watch me watch me prove you wrong  
Stand up everybody  
Get up say it loud  
We're bombshells raisin' hell now  
Watch me watch me watch me prove you wrong  
Well there you go again you're talkin' down on me Huh  
I may look innocent don't underestimate me Uh-uh  
I'm gold I'm platinum don't you know I'm outta your league  
Step back your time is up sit down I'm takin' the lead Oh  
I'm a babe I'm a boss and I'm makin' this money Uh-huh  
I can flip like a switch and I cut like a blade Try to get it now  
I can sting like a bee but I'm sweeter than honey Uh-huh  
And I'm quick as a whip so get outta my way Come and get it now  
I ain't no dumb blonde  
I ain't no stupid Barbie doll  
I got my game on  
Watch me watch me watch me prove you wrong  
I ain't no dumb blonde  
I am a freaking cherry bomb  
I'll be your icon  
Watch me watch me watch me prove you wrong  
Stand up everybody  
Get up say it loud  
We're bombshells raisin' hell now  
Watch me watch me watch me prove you wrong  
Stand up everybody  
Get up say it loud  
We're bombshells raisin' hell now  
Watch me watch me watch me prove you wrong  
Yo I ain't playin' but I won the cup  
Came through heavy on it in the Bentley truck （Uh-huh）  
It was me young Avril security tucked （Okay）  
In the back just in case one of y'all run up （Rrr）  
One of y'all um um all of y'all be stuck （Uh-huh）  
When you see a young queen in the flesh what's up （What up ）  
All the hatin' you was doin' got the Barbie poppin'  
Now all of them wanna be a Barbie I'm watchin'  
But you never gon' stop me never gon' top me  
Millions on millions they never gon' dock me

And no I don't want no frauds wink wink
