### Meanwhile Back at Mama’s歌词：

[Verse 1: Tim McGraw]  
Runnin round in this new truck  
Bank lets me borrow from month to month  
I'm runnin out of credit, find a little Cash on the radio  
Standin still they're blowin past, numbers on cars goin NASCAR fast  
What I wouldn't give for a slow down, don't ya know?  
Cause where I come from, only the horses run  
When the day is done, we take it easy

[Chorus: Tim McGraw]  
Meanwhile back at Mama's  
The porch light's on, come on in if you wanna  
Supper's on the stove and beer's in the fridge  
Red sun sinkin' out low on the ridge  
Games on the tube and Daddy smokes cigarettes  
Whiskey keeps his whistle wet  
Funny the things you thought you'd never miss  
In a world gone crazy as this

[Verse 2: Tim McGraw]  
Well I found a girl and we don't fit in here  
Talk about how hard it is to breathe here  
Even with the windows down can't catch a southern breeze here  
One of these days gonna pack it up and leave here  
Cause

[Chorus: Both]

[Bridge: Both]  
Oh I miss yeah a little dirt on the road, I miss corn growin in a row  
I miss being somebody everybody knows, there everybody knows everybody  
I miss those small town routes, walkin around in muddy boots  
The sound of rain on an old tin roof  
It's time we head on back

[Chorus: Both]  
Cause meanwhile back at Mama's  
The for sale sign's goin up and I'm gonna  
Dump this truck and the little I got  
On a loan to own and a three-acre lot  
Put supper on the stove and beer in the fridge  
Goin' for broke and we're gonna be rich  
Watch the sun settin on the ridge  
Baby tell me what you think about this

[Outro: Both]  
Me and you back at Mama's  
Yeah me and you back at Mama's
