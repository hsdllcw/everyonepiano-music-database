### Rubberband歌词：

Was it a wasted couple months?  
Sneaking outta the window, spending nights in limbo  
Was that all there was for us?  
Midnight driving, running through highland  
Does it make me the criminal?  
That I let you go  
That I broke us and left  
I hate that I never know  
Why you're still so caught up in my head  
I know you wanted a promise  
I wasn't ready, can I be honest?  
Never knew what I had until I lost it  
And I got this rubber band on my wrist, on my wrist  
And I snap it every time that I think about your lips  
Got this rubber band on my wrist, on my wrist  
Almost break it every time when I'm trying to forget  
I know that I have never been good at this  
Love you in a second, next you know I'm checking out  
Of moments I shouldn't miss  
Now I'm looking through the photos  
Wishing I was different  
And I got this rubber band on my wrist, on my wrist  
And I snap it every time that I think about your lips  
Got this rubber band on my wrist, on my wrist  
Almost break it every time when I'm trying to forget  
Trying to forget (Trying to forget)  
Trying to forget (To forget, to forget, to forget)  
Trying to forget (Trying to forget, trying to forget)  
Trying to forget  
I know you wanted a promise  
I wasn't ready, can I be honest?  
Never knew what I had until I lost it  
And I got this rubber band on my wrist, on my wrist  
And I snap it every time that I think about your lips  
Got this rubber band on my wrist, on my wrist  
Almost break it every time when I'm trying to forget  
Trying to forget (Trying to forget)  
Trying to forget (Trying to forget)  
Trying to forget  
Hmm-hmm, hmm  
Trying to forget (Trying to forget)  
Trying to forget (Trying to forget)  
Trying to forget (Trying to forget)  
Oh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh  
I'm trying to forget
