### Sun Comes Up歌词：

[Verse 1]  
I wonder, maybe they'd never find me  
I've been waitin' such a long, long, long time to feel it  
Swallowed by the waters around me  
Though I took so many wrong, wrong, wrong turns to see it, woah  
[Pre-Chorus]  
But I dance through the blisters at night  
And I laughed 'til I cried and cried and  
I ran 'til my feet couldn't run no more (no more, no more)  
And I sat 'til my lungs were burnin'  
'Til I know I'm alive, alive, yeah  
I'll sit 'til I can't hear words no more  
[Chorus]  
Suddenly the sun comes up  
And I feel my love floodin' back again, yeah  
Until the sun goes up  
And I feel my love comin' up again  
Suddenly the sun comes up  
And the dark is gone  
We made it to the dawn  
And I don't miss you anymore  
When the sun comes up  
I can feel my love comin' back again  
[Verse 2]  
It wasn't easy tryin' to run with these handcuffs  
I had to sleep through such a cold, cold, cold night to see it  
Green flashes hit me right where I'm standing  
Sunlight cut into your bones, bones, bones, started to heal it  
[Pre-Chorus]  
But I dance through the blisters at night  
And I laughed 'til I cried and cried and  
I ran 'til my feet couldn't run no more (no more, no more)  
And I sat 'til my lungs were burnin'  
'Til I know I'm alive, alive, yeah  
I'll sit 'til I can't hear words no more  
[Chorus]  
Suddenly the sun comes up  
And I feel my love floodin' back again, yeah  
Until the sun goes up  
And I feel my love comin' up again  
Suddenly the sun comes up  
And the dark is gone  
We made it to the dawn  
And I don't miss you anymore  
When the sun comes up  
I can feel my love comin' back again  
[Bridge]  
Give a little light  
To get a little love back  
Give a little light  
To get a little love back  
Give a little light  
To get a little love back  
Won't you give it  
Give a little love back  
Give a little light  
To get a little love back  
Won't you give it  
Turn your light on me  
Give a little light  
To get a little love back  
Give a little, to get a little love  
Give a little light  
To get a little love back  
To get a little love back  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Dance through the blisters at night  
I laughed 'til I cried and cried and  
I ran 'til my feet couldn't run no more (no more, no more)  
And I sat 'til my lungs were burnin'  
I'm alive, alive  
I can't hear words no more  
[Chorus]  
Suddenly the sun comes up  
And I feel my love  
Sun comes up again, my love  
Until the sun comes up  
And I feel my love comin' up again  
I can feel my love, I can feel my love  
[Outro]  
Sun comes up  
I can feel my love comin' back again
