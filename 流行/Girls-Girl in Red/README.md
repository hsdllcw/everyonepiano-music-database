### Girls歌词：

I've been hiding for so long  
These feelings they're not gone  
Can I tell anyone  
Afraid of what they'll say  
So I push them away  
I'm acting so strange  
They're so pretty it hurts  
I'm not talking 'bout boys  
I'm talking 'bout girls  
They're so pretty with their button up shirts  
Ohoooo  
I shouldn't be feeling this  
But it's too hard to resist  
Soft skin and soft lips  
I should be into this guy  
But it's just a waste of time  
He's really not my type  
I know what I like  
No this is not a phase  
Or a coming of age  
This will never change  
They're so pretty it hurts  
I'm not talking 'bout boys  
I'm talking 'bout girls  
They're so pretty with their button up shirts  
Ohooo  
They're so pretty it hurts  
I'm not talking 'bout boys  
I'm talking 'bout girls  
They're so pretty with their button up shirts  
Ohooo  
'Cause I don't know what to do  
It's not like I get to choose who I love  
Who I love who I love who I love  
They're so pretty it hurts  
I'm not talking 'bout boys  
I'm talking 'bout girls  
They're so pretty with their button up shirts  
Ohooo  
And they're so pretty it hurts  
I'm not talking 'bout boys  
I'm talking 'bout girls  
They're so pretty it hurts  
Ohooo
