Hit the Road Jack歌词：

  
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back  
No more, no more, no more, no more  
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more  
What you say?  
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back  
No more, no more, no more, no more  
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more  
Woah, woman, oh woman, don't treat me so mean  
You're the meanest old woman that I've ever seen  
I guess if you said so  
I'd have to pack my things and go  
(That's right)  
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back  
No more, no more, no more, no more  
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more  
What you say?  
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back  
No more, no more, no more, no more  
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more  
Now baby, listen baby, don't ya treat me this a way  
'Cause I'll be back on my feet some day  
Don't care if you do 'cause it's understood  
You ain't got no money you just ain't no good  
Well, I guess if you say so  
I'd have to pack my things and go  
(That's right)  
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back  
No more, no more, no more, no more  
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more  
What you say?  
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back  
No more, no more, no more, no more  
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more  
Well  
(Don't you come back no more)  
Uh, what you say?  
(Don't you come back no more)  
I didn't understand you  
(Don't you come back no more)  
You can't mean that  
(Don't you come back no more)  
Oh, now baby, please  
(Don't you come back no more)  
What you tryin' to do to me?  
(Don't you come back no more)  
Oh, don't treat me like that  
(Don't you come back no more)
