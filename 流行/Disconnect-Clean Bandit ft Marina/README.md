**Disconnect双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Disconnect_ 是Clean Bandit与Marina一同合作的歌曲。Clean
Bandit是来自英国的电音乐队，2009年成立于英国剑桥，由杰克•帕特森、格瑞斯•查托、卢克•帕特森和尼尔•阿明-
史密斯（2016年退出）组成。古典乐与电子乐融合的概念其实并不新奇，然而Clean
Bandit的独到之处便在于，古典弦乐在他们的音乐中扮演的不再是一个辅助的角色。他们始终以一种DIY的态度做音乐，除了是古典与电子的混搭，他们还利用一切可以利用的资源，将其融入进他们的音乐中。在这支乐队中，没有真正意义上的主唱，他们找来不同的歌手在不同的歌曲中进行合唱，寻找一种最完美的平衡。

### Disconnect歌词：

I've been feeling anxious  
Ain't been feeling right  
I've been staying up yeah  
Staying up all night  
I've been calling exes  
Tryna disconnect  
I can't cut the wires  
Running round my head  
Need to look after myself  
Yeah I need to take a breath  
Need to look after my health  
Yeah I need to disconnect  
Yeah I need to take a breath, oo-ooh  
Yeah I need to disconnect, oo-ooh  
Oo-ooh  
Oo-ooh  
I go out all night yeah  
I go home alone  
Sleeping in my bed  
Head beside my phone  
Looking at the screen  
Glowing in the dark  
I just wanna dream  
But I can't seem to switch off  
Need to look after myself  
Yeah I need to take a breath  
Need to look after my health  
Yeah I need to disconnect  
Yeah I need to take a breath, oo-ooh  
Yeah I need to disconnect, oo-ooh  
Feel my body shutting down  
I don't wanna hear a sound  
Feel my battery running low  
I don't wanna be alone  
Yeah I need to take a breath  
Yeah I need to disconnect  
Feel my fuse about to blow  
Babe I need to hit the road  
Don't know where I wanna go  
I don't wanna be alone  
Living through a telephone  
Like a body covered in chrome  
Feel my body shutting down  
I don't wanna hear a sound  
Yeah I need to take a breath  
Yeah I need to disconnect  
Oo-ooh, oo-ooh  
Oo-ooh, oo-ooh  
Oo-ooh, oo-ooh  
Oo-ooh, oo-ooh
