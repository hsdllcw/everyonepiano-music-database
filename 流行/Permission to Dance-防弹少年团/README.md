### Permission to Dance歌词：

It's the thought of being young  
When your heart's just like a drum  
Beating louder with no way to guard it  
When it all seems like it's wrong  
Just sing along to Elton John  
And to that feeling  
We're just getting started  
When the nights get colder  
And the rhythms got you falling behind  
Just dream about that moment  
When you look yourself right  
In the eye eye eye  
Then you say  
I wanna dance  
The music's got me going  
Ain't nothing that can stop  
How we move yeah  
Let's break our plans  
And live just like we're golden  
And roll in like we're dancing fools  
We don't need to worry  
'Cause when we fall we know how to land  
Don't need to talk the talk  
Just walk the walk tonight  
'Cause we don't need permission to dance  
There's always something  
That's standing in the way  
But if you don't let it faze ya  
You'll know just how to break  
Just keep the right vibe yeah  
'Cause there's no looking back  
There ain't no one to prove  
We don't got this on lock yeah  
The wait is over  
The time is now so let's do it right  
Yeah we'll keep going  
And stay up until we see the sunrise  
And we'll say  
I wanna dance  
The music's got me going  
Ain't nothing that can stop  
How we move yeah  
Let's break our plans  
And live just like we're golden  
And roll in like we're dancing fools  
We don't need to worry  
'Cause when we fall we know how to land  
Don't need to talk the talk  
Just walk the walk tonight  
'Cause we don't need permission to dance  
Da na na na na na na  
Da na na na na na na  
Da na na na na na na  
No we don't need permission to dance  
Da na na na na na na  
Da na na na na na na  
Da na na na na na na  
Well let me show ya  
That we can keep the fire alive  
'Cause it's not over  
Till it's over say it one more time  
Say  
I wanna dance  
The music's got me going  
Ain't nothing that can stop  
How we move yeah  
Let's break our plans  
And live just like we're golden  
And roll in like we're dancing fools  
We don't need to worry  
'Cause when we fall we know how to land  
Don't need to talk the talk  
Just walk the walk tonight  
'Cause we don't need permission to dance
