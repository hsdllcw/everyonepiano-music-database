### Hot Girl Bummer歌词：

F**k you and you and you  
I hate your friends and they hate me too  
I'm through I'm through I'm through  
This that hot girl bummer anthem  
Turn it up and throw a tantrum  
This that hot girl bummer anthem  
Turn it up and throw a tantrum  
This that throw up in your Birkin bag  
Hook up with someone random  
This that social awkward suicide  
That bite your lips and buy your likes  
I swear she had a man  
But s**t hit different when it's Thursday night  
That college dropout music  
Everyday leg day she be too thicc  
And my friends are all annoying  
But we go dumb yeah we go stupid  
This that 10K on the table just so we can be secluded  
And the vodka came diluted  
One more line I'm superhuman  
F**k you and you and you  
I hate your friends and they hate me too  
I'm through I'm through I'm through  
This that hot girl bummer anthem  
Turn it up and throw a tantrum  
F**k you and you and you  
I hate your friends and they hate me too  
F**k you and you and you  
This that hot girl bummer anthem  
Turn it up and throw a tantrum  
This that hot girl bummer two-step  
They can't box me in I'm too left  
This that drip it's more like oceans  
They can't fit me in a Trojan  
Out of pocket but I'm always in my bag yeah that's the slogan  
This that who's all there  
I'm pullin' up wit' a emo chick that's broken  
This that college dropout music  
Everyday leg day she be too thicc  
And my friends are all annoying  
But we go dumb yeah we go stupid  
This that 10K on the table just so we can be secluded  
And the vodka came diluted  
One more line I'm superhuman  
F**k you and you and you  
I hate your friends and they hate me too  
I'm through I'm through I'm through  
This that hot girl bummer anthem  
Turn it up and throw a tantrum  
F**k you and you and you  
I hate your friends and they hate me too  
F**k you and you and you  
This that hot girl bummer anthem  
Turn it up and throw a tantrum  
This that college dropout music  
Everyday leg day she be too thicc  
And my friends are all annoying  
But we go dumb yeah we go stupid  
This that college dropout music  
Everyday leg day she be too thicc  
And my friends are all annoying  
But we go dumb yeah we go stupid  
We go stupid we go stupid we go  
And you want me to change  
F**k you and you and you  
I hate your friends and they hate me too  
I'm through I'm through I'm through  
This that hot girl bummer anthem  
Turn it up and throw a tantrum  
F**k you and you and you  
I hate your friends and they hate me too  
F**k you and you and you  
This that hot girl bummer anthem  
Turn it up and throw a tantrum
