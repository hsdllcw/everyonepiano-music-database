《 **Stayin' Alive** 》是Bee
Gees为电影《SaturdayNightFever》（周末夜狂热）创作的一首歌曲，并于1977年12月13日发行。在1978年2月4日登上美国Billboard
Hot 100的榜首，并且在该位置停留了四周，在英国也登上了畅销榜的第四名。根据乐队成员之一Robin Gibb所说，这首歌传达的是这样一种情绪："is
about survival in the big city—any big city—but especially New
York."（《活着》是一首关于在大城市中生存的歌，任何大城市，特别在纽约）

  

Bee Gees 出生在爱尔兰海的曼岛，比吉斯兄弟从小便受音乐的薰陶，父亲
Hugh是乐团的团长，母亲Barbara则是位歌手。9岁那时Barry已经开始歌唱并弹奏父亲送给他的吉他，帮他伴奏的是两个6岁的双胞胎兄弟
Robin与Maurice。Robin与Barry那独一无二的嗓音成为日后乐团的著名卷标，Maurice则是在吉他、贝斯及键盘等乐器上钻研。在十几岁时，他们随着父母搬至澳洲，以Rattlesnakes为团名在布里斯本的赛马场表演。

Stayin' Alive歌词：

  

Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk,  
I'm a woman's man: no time to talk.  
Music loud and women warm, I've been kicked around  
Since I was born.  
And now it's all right. It's OK.  
And you may look the other way.  
We can try to understand  
The New York Times' effect on man.

Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother,  
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.  
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin',  
And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.  
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive.  
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive.

Well now, I get low and I get high,  
And if I can't get either, I really try.  
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes.  
I'm a dancin' man and I just can't lose.  
You know it's all right. It's OK.  
I'll live to see another day.  
We can try to understand  
The New York Times' effect on man.

Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother,  
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.  
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin',  
And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.  
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive.  
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive.

Life goin' nowhere. Somebody help me.  
Somebody help me, yeah.  
Life goin' nowhere. Somebody help me, yeah.  
Stayin' alive.

Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk,  
I'm a woman's man: no time to talk.  
Music loud and women warm,  
I've been kicked around since I was born.  
And now it's all right. It's OK.  
And you may look the other way.  
We can try to understand  
The New York Times' effect on man.

Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother,  
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.  
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin',  
And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.  
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive.  
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive.

Life goin' nowhere. Somebody help me.  
Somebody help me, yeah.  
Life goin' nowhere. Somebody help me, yeah.  
I'm stayin' alive.

Life goin' nowhere. Somebody help me.  
Somebody help me, yeah.  
Life goin' nowhere. Somebody help me, yeah.  
I'm stayin' alive.

Life goin' nowhere. Somebody help me.  
Somebody help me, yeah.  
Life goin' nowhere. Somebody help me, yeah.  
I'm stayin' alive.

Life goin' nowhere. Somebody help me.  
Somebody help me, yeah.  
Life goin' nowhere. Somebody help me, yeah.  
I'm stayin' alive.
