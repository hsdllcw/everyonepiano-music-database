### Can't Stop the Feeling!歌词：

I got this feeling inside my bones  
(It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on)  
All through my city, all through my home  
We're flying up, no ceiling, when we in our zone...

I got that sunshine in my pocket  
Got that good song in my feet  
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops  
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally  
You gon' like the way we rock it, so don't stop

Under the lights when everything goes  
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close  
When we move, well, you already know  
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine  
Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance  
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you  
So just dance, dance, dance, come on  
All those things I should do to you  
But you dance, dance, dance  
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing

I can't stop the feeling  
So just dance, dance, dance  
I can't stop the feeling  
So just dance, dance, dance, come on

Ooh, it's something magical  
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on  
I don't need no reason, don't need control  
I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone

Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket  
Got that good song in my feet  
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops  
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally  
You gon' like the way we rock it, so don't stop

Under the lights when everything goes  
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close  
When we move, well, you already know  
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine  
Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance  
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you  
So just dance, dance, dance, come on  
All those things I should do to you  
But you dance, dance, dance  
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing

I can't stop the feeling  
So just dance, dance, dance  
I can't stop the feeling  
So just dance, dance, dance  
I can't stop the feeling  
So just dance, dance, dance  
I can't stop the feeling  
So keep dancing, come on

I can't stop the, I can't stop the  
I can't stop the, I can't stop the  
I can't stop the feeling...

Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance  
(I can't stop the feeling)  
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you  
So just dance, dance, dance, come on  
(I can't stop the feeling...)  
All those things I should do to you  
But you dance, dance, dance  
(I can't stop the feeling...)  
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing

Everybody sing!  
(I can't stop the feeling)  
Got this feeling in my body  
(I can't stop the feeling)  
Got this feeling in my body  
(I can't stop the feeling)  
Wanna see you move your body  
(I can't stop the feeling)  
Got this feeling in my body  
Break it down  
Got this feeling in my body  
Can't stop the feeling...

(Got this feeling in my body, come on...)
