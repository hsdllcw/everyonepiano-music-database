### DNA歌词:

Does he tell you he loves you when you least expect it  
Does he flutter your heart when he kisses your neck

No scientist, or biology  
It's obvious, when he's holding me  
It's only natural that I'm so affected

And my heart won't beat again  
If I can't feel him in my veins  
No need to question, I already know  
It's in his dna  
D-d-d-dna  
It's in his dna  
And he just takes my breath away  
B-b-breath away  
I feel it every day, and that's what makes a man  
Not hard to understand  
Perfect in every way  
I see it in his face  
Nothing more to say  
It's in his d-d-d-dna

It's the blue in his eyes that helps me see the future

Fingerprints that leave me covered for days, yeah yeah  
Now I don't have any first degree  
But I know, what he does to me  
No need to work it out, it's so familiar

And my heart won't beat again  
If I can't feel him in my veins  
No need to question, I already know  
It's in his dna  
D-d-d-dna

It's in his dna  
And he just takes my breath away  
B-b-breath away  
I feel it every day, and that's what makes a man  
Not hard to understand  
Perfect in every way  
I see it in his face  
Nothing more to say  
It's in his d-d-d-dna

It's all about his kiss  
Contaminates my lips  
Our energy connects  
It's simple genetic

I'm the x to his y  
It's the colour of his eyes  
He can do no wrong  
No he don't need to try  
Made from the best  
He passes all the tests  
Got my heart beating fast  
It's cardiac arrest  
He's from a different strain  
That science can't explain

I guess that's how he's made  
In his d-d-d-dna

It's in his dna  
D-d-d-dna  
It's in his dna  
And he just takes my breath away  
B-b-breath away  
I feel it every day, and that's what makes a man  
Not hard to understand

Perfect in every way  
I see it in his face  
Nothing more to say  
It's in his d-d-d-dna
