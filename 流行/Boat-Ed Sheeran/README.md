### Boat歌词：

Came in for the embers  
Stayed out for the breeze  
I need to feel elements to remind me  
There's beauty when it's bleak  
Stuck out long before lights down  
Why do I breathe  
Oh I know  
The more that I love the less that I feel  
The times that I jumped never were real  
They say that all scars will heal but I know  
Maybe I won't  
But the waves won't break my boat  
But the waves won't break my boat  
The stones crash on the boardwalk  
The wind rush through the trees  
I keep my eyes peeled  
The memories always fall short  
Of what we could have been  
Left out long before last call  
What do I need  
Oh I know  
The more that I love the less that I feel  
The times that I jumped never were real  
They say that all scars will heal but I know  
Maybe I won't  
But the waves won't break my boat  
But the waves won't break my boat  
But the waves won't break my boat  
The waves won't break my boat  
The more that I love the less that I feel  
The times that I jumped never were real  
They say that all scars will heal but I know  
Maybe I won't  
And the waves won't break my boat
