**Love Yourself双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Love Yourself_ 是一首由加拿大歌手Justin
Bieber演唱的歌曲，收录在专辑《Purpose》中。在技术层面，该专辑依靠大腕阵容打造出有量有料流行精品。动感电音、性感R&B以及钢琴伴奏慢情歌，动用一百种方式展示专业。展示出的超强可塑性近乎于炫技，这证明，虽然近几年专注于消耗偶像资本，但这位大众偶像的业务能力并未疏于修炼。更难得的是，此番炫技并非过于在架势上虚张声势，这是货真价实的实力展示。相比年少时幼稚质感，如今成年后果真修养出沉稳有厚度。

### Love Yourself歌词：

For all the times that you rain on my parade  
一直以来 你就是淋湿我天堂的雨水  
And all the clubs you get in using my name  
你习惯打着我的名号混进每个夜店  
You think you broke my heart oh girl for goodness sake  
你以为你伤透我心 但女孩看在上帝份上省省吧  
You think I'm crying oh my oh well no I ain't  
你以为我会为你伤心哭泣 好吧 我根本就不会  
And I didn't wanna write a song cause  
甚至我都不愿写歌怀念你  
I didn't want anyone thinking I still care  
因为我不想让别人觉得我还在乎你  
I don't but you still hit my phone up  
你不停打我电话而我早就不联系你了  
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'  
宝贝 我早就放下了 我想你也应该释怀  
I don't wanna hold back maybe you should know that  
我不愿自己沉沦过往 或许你应该明白  
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone  
我妈妈人见人爱独独不喜欢你  
And I never like to admit that I was wrong  
我从不愿意承认曾经我的过错  
And I've been so caught up in my job didn't see  
一直以来我都醉心工作 不明白  
what's going on

But when you told me that you hated my friends  
当你对我说你不喜欢我的朋友们时  
The only problem was with you and not them

And every time you told me my opinion was wrong  
每一次你反驳我意见并不可取时  
And tried to make me forget where I came from  
你都会让我忘了真正的自我
