### Makes Me Wonder歌词：

I wake up with blood-shot eyes  
Struggled to memorize  
The way it felt between your thighs  
Pleasure that made you cry

Feels so good to be bad  
Not worth the aftermath, after that  
After that  
Try to get you back

I still don’t have the reason  
And you don’t have the time  
And it really makes me wonder

Give me something to believe in  
Cause I don’t believe in you anymore  
Anymore  
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try  
(Yeah)  
So this is goodbye

God damn my spinning head  
Decisions that made my bed  
Now I must lay in it  
And deal with things I left unsaid

I want to dive into you  
Forget what you’re going through  
I get behind, make your move  
Forget about the truth

I still don’t have the reason  
And you don’t have the time  
And it really makes me wonder

Give me something to believe in  
Cause I don’t believe in you anymore  
Anymore  
I wonder if it even makes a difference,  
It even makes a difference to try

And you talk about how you\'re feeling  
But I don’t believe it’s true anymore  
Anymore  
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry  
(Oh no)  
So this is goodbye

I’ve been here before  
One day a week  
And it won’t hurt anymore

You caught me in a lie  
I have no alibi  
The words you say don\'t have a meaning  
Cause

I still don’t have the reason  
And you don’t have the time  
And it really makes me wonder

And I...and so this is goodbye

Give me something to believe in  
Cause I don’t believe in you anymore  
Anymore  
I wonder if it even makes a difference,  
It even makes a difference to try

And you talk about how you\'re feeling  
But I don’t believe it’s true anymore  
Anymore  
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry  
(Oh no)  
So this is goodbye

(Oh no)  
So this is goodbye, yeah  
(Oh no)  
So this is goodbye, yeah  
(Oh no)  
So this is goodbye, yeah
