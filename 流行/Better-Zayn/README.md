**Better** 是英国歌手Zayn演唱的歌曲，收录于2021年发行的音乐专辑《Nobody is Listening》。

超低的鼓打底，悠扬的弦乐，平稳的节拍，还有这Zayn拿捏死死的蓝调唱腔，这种静谧氤氲又不失浪漫的格调，谁不爱呢？

### Better歌词：

Hope I only leave good vibes on your living room floor  
It hurts so bad that I didn't when you asked for more  
Your dad probably loves me more than he ever did now  
'Cause I finally got up  
Yeah we're finally knocked down  
Yeah sometimes it's better that way  
Gotta let it go so your heart don't break  
'Cause I love you  
Yeah baby I love you  
Just this one time hear what I'm tryna say  
Know you might not feel quite the same way  
But I love you  
I tell you I love you  
Why why wait to fight  
Give it a try  
Or I'll say goodbye while it's right  
Can we save tears in your eyes  
I'm making you cry  
Why wait to hate can we save love  
I fell in I'm falling I'm for you  
I can't let you fall through the floor too  
It's a gamble to take any more of you  
It's a gamble to take-take more you  
Still in my mind sometimes I must admit it  
Like it's a crime on trial I got acquitted  
Me and you wasn't meant we wasn't fitted  
Like it's a glove I hated to admit it  
'Cause obviously we go back  
So why would we ruin that  
In too deep we're rearranged  
Now you wanna ask for names  
We can't let this fruit go bad  
Sayin' things we can't take back  
In too deep we're rearranged  
Say you feel the same  
Why why wait to fight  
Give it a try  
Or I'll say goodbye while it's right  
Can we save tears in your eyes  
I'm watching you cry  
Why wait to hate can we save love
