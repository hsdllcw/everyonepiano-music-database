### The One That Got Away歌词：

Summer after high school when we first met  
We make up in your Mustang to Radiohead  
And on my 18th Birthday  
We got that chain tattoos  
Used to steal your parents' liquor  
And climb to the roof  
Talk about our future  
like we had a clue  
Never plan that one day  
I'd be loosing you  
And in another life  
I would be your girl  
We keep for of promises  
Be us against the world  
And in other life  
I would make you stay  
So I don't have to say  
You were the one that got away  
The one that got away  
I was dreaming you were my Johnny Cash  
Never one we got the other We made a pact  
Sometimes when i miss you  
I put those records on oh  
Someone said you had your tattoo removed  
Saw you downtown singing the Booms  
Its time to face the music  
I longer amused  
And in another life  
I would be your girl  
We keep full of promises  
Be us against the world  
And in another life  
I would make you stay  
So I don't have to say  
You were the one that got away  
the one that got away  
The one The one The one  
The one that got away  
All these money can't buy me a  
Time machine No  
Can't replace you with a  
Million rings No  
Shoulda told you what you meant to me Wo  
Cause now i pay the price  
And in another life  
I would be your girl  
We keep for of promises  
Be us against the world  
And in another life  
I would make you stay  
So I don't have to say  
You were the one that got away  
The one that got away  
The one The one The one  
And in another life  
I would make you stay  
So I don't have to say  
You were the one that got away  
The one that got away
