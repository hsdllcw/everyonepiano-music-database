### Little Talks歌词：

Hey! Hey! Hey!  
I don't like walking around this old and empty house.  
So hold my hand, I'll walk with you my dear  
The stairs creak as I sleep,  
it's keeping me awake  
It's the house telling you to close your eyes  
Some days I can't even dress myself.  
It's killing me to see you this way.  
'Cause though the truth may vary  
this ship will carry our bodies safe to shore.  
Hey! Hey! Hey!  
There's an old voice in my head  
that's holding me back  
Well tell her that I miss our little talks.  
Soon it will all be over,  
buried with our past  
We used to play outside when we were young  
and full of life and full of love.  
Some days I feel like I'm wrong when I am right.  
Your mind is playing tricks on you my dear.  
'Cause though the truth may vary  
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore  
Hey!  
Don't listen to a word I say  
Hey!  
The screams all sound the same.  
Hey!  
Though the truth may vary  
this ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

You're gone, gone, gone away,  
I watched you disappear.  
All that's left is a ghost of you.  
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart,  
there's nothing we can do,  
Just let me go,  
we'll meet again soon.  
Now wait, wait, wait for me,  
please hang around  
I'll see you when I fall asleep.  
Hey!  
Don't listen to a word I say  
Hey!  
The screams all sound the same.  
Hey!  
Though the truth may vary  
this ship will carry our bodies safe to shore  
Don't listen to a word I say  
Hey!  
The screams all sound the same.  
Hey!  
Though the truth may vary  
this ship will carry our bodies safe to shore  
Though the truth may vary  
this ship will carry our bodies safe to shore  
Though the truth may vary  
this ship will carry our bodies safe to shore
