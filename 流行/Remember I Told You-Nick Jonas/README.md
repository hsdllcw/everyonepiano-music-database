### Remember I Told You歌词：

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]  
Remember I told you, I need you  
Remember the spotlight, what's that?  
All of the words that I'm saying  
Are just a fancy way of saying "I care"  
[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]  
I don't suppose you have a moment to spare me  
Do you? Do you?  
I've been looking for lovin', all the wrong places  
You too? You too?  
[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]  
I don't like to wait when you tell me "oh well"  
I have the suspicion you're not being yourself  
I don't suppose you have a moment to spare me  
Do you? Do you?  
[Chorus: Nick Jonas]  
Remember I told you, I need you  
Remember the spotlight, what's that?  
All of the words that I'm saying  
Are just a fancy way of saying "I care"  
[Verse 2: Anne-Marie]  
You're probably somewhere, with someone I don't know  
That's cool, and that's cool  
And I hope that she gives you, all the things that you deserve  
That's true, that's true  
[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas & Anne-Marie]  
I don't like to wait when you tell me "oh well"  
I have the suspicion you're not being yourself  
You're probably somewhere, with someone I don't know  
That's cool, and that's cool  
[Chorus: Nick Jonas, Anne-Marie & Mike Posner]  
Remember I told you, I need you  
Remember the spotlight, what's that?  
All of the words that I'm saying  
Are just a fancy way of saying "I care"  
[Bridge: Mike Posner]  
Let it cut it off, and we know why  
I'm in love with myself, cold inside  
Too many shoes in your closet, go some miles  
I suck at talking to girls, here goes a try  
More woman than I should've in a century  
Bitches on my side like a Kennedy  
Starting to drain all my energy  
I love it, shoot the frame like an enemy  
At the same time, and I can't lie  
Too many girls for the way that I rock the bassline  
You got addicted to the seas of the bassline  
Lets see how you're gonna do with the back and forth fameline  
After all the shit we been through  
I play the rocksea, I ain't 'bout to guestlist you  
And I know I'm talking shit, it ain't fair  
Hate is just a fancy way saying that I care  
[Chorus: Nick Jonas, Anne-Marie & Mike Posner]  
Remember I told you, I need you  
Remember the spotlight, what's that?  
All of the words that I'm saying  
Are just a fancy way of saying "I care"  
Remember I told you, I need you  
Remember the spotlight, what's that?  
All of the words that I'm saying  
Are just a fancy way of saying "I care"  
Saying I care
