### Escape歌词：

Here's how it goes, you and me, up and down BUT MAYBE THIS TIME  
We'll get right, WORTH THE FIGHT  
Cause love is something you can't shake  
When it breaks  
All it takes is some trying  
If you feel like leaving  
If you feel like leaving  
If you feel like leaving  
I'm not gonna make you stay  
I'm not gonna make you stay  
I'm not gonna make you stay  
Soon you'll be finding  
Soon you'll be finding  
Soon you'll be finding  
You can run, you can hide  
You can run, you can hide  
You can run, you can hide  
But you can't escape my love  
But you can't escape my love  
But you can't escape my love  
You can run, you can hide  
You can run, you can hide  
But you can't escape my love  
But you can't escape my love  
So if you go  
You should know  
It's hard to just forget the past so fast  
It was good, it was bad but it was real  
And that's all you get, in the end OUR LOVE MATTERED  
Here's how it goes  
All it takes is some trying  
You can run, you can hide
