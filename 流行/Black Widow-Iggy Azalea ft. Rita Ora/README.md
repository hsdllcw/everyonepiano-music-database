**Black Widow** 为Iggy Azalea首张专辑《The New Classic》的第10首歌曲，第五首打榜单曲，与Rita Ora合作。

  
《 _Black Widow_ 》MV中，阿米莉亚•凯利（Iggy
Azalea）手持武士刀化身《杀死比尔》里的复仇女神，瑞塔•奥拉也毫不逊色，紧身皮衣大秀乳沟，勾勒性感事业线，唱着“我将爱你直至恨你入骨”的歌词，刀光剑影之间尽显豪气真性情，与阿米莉亚•凯利联手击退恶党，恶党由在《杀死比尔》中饰演布德的迈克尔•马德森(Michael
Madsen)扮演。在纸牌游戏情节中，美国饶舌歌手T.I.也客串了一下。

  
阿米莉亚•凯利（Iggy Azalea）不但自己写词，更邀请了好友“水果姐”凯蒂•佩里、萨拉•哈德森等一同制作歌曲，歌曲幕后阵容强大。

### Black Widow歌词：

I'm gonna love ya until you hate me  
And I'm gonna show ya what's really crazy  
You should've known better than to mess with me, honey  
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya, gonna love ya  
Like a black widow, baby  
This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same  
First we're both down to play, then somehow you go astray  
We went from nothing to something, liking to loving  
It was us against the world and now we're just fucking  
It's like I loved you so much and now I just hate you  
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you  
I wanted all or nothing for us, ain't no place in between  
By me believing what you say that you never mean  
Like it'll last forever but now forever ain't as long  
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be stuck singing this song  
You were different from my last but now you got a mirror  
But as it all plays out I see it couldn't be clearer, now sing  
You used to be thirsty for me  
But now you wanna be set free  
This is the web, web that you weave  
So baby now rest in peace  
I'm gonna love ya until you hate me  
And I'm gonna show ya what's really crazy  
You should've known better than to mess with me, honey  
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya, gonna love ya  
Like a black widow, baby  
I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts  
Just to get you, I'm doing whatever works  
You have never met nobody that'd do ya how I do ya  
That will bring you to your knees, praise Jesus hallelujah  
I'ma make you beg for it, plead for it  
Till you feel like you breathe for it  
Till you do any and everything for it  
I want you to fiend for it, wake up and dream for it  
Till it's got you gasping for air and you leave for it  
Till they have a cat scan on your mind and it's nothin but me  
Now it's me time believe that  
If it's yours when you want it, I wouldn't promise I need that  
Till I'm everywhere that you be at  
I can't fall back, go quick  
Cause this here is fatal attraction so I take it all or I don't want shh  
You used to be thirsty for me  
But now you wanna be set free  
This is the web, web that you weave  
So baby now rest in peace  
I'm gonna love ya until you hate me  
And I'm gonna show ya what's really crazy  
You should've known better than to mess with me, honey  
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya, gonna love ya  
Like a black widow, baby  
black black widow, baby
