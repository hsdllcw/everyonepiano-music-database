### Feel This Moment歌词：

Ask for money, and get it viced  
Ask for advice, get money twice  
I'm from the Dirty, but that chico nice  
Y'all call it a moment, I call it life  
Christina Aguilera  
One day when the light is glowing  
I’ll be in my castle golden  
But until the gates are open  
I just wanna feel this moment (ohhh)  
I just wanna feel this moment (ohhh)  
I just wanna feel this moment  
Mr Worldwide  
Oye mamita, come on, dale, que la cosa esta rica  
(I wanna feel this moment)  
Feel this moment...  
Reporting live, from the tallest building in Tokyo  
Long ways from the hard ways  
Bill sos, and oh yeas  
They count it always, 305 all day  
Now baby we can party, oh baby we can party  
She read books, especially about red rooms and tight ups  
I got it hooked, cause she seen me in a suit with the red ta-ta up  
Meet and greet, nice to meet ya, but time is money  
Only difference is I own it, now let's stop time and enjoy this moment  
Christina Aguilera  
One day when the light is glowing  
I’ll be in my castle golden  
But until the gates are open  
I just wanna feel this moment (ohhh)  
I just wanna feel this moment (ohhh)  
I just wanna feel this moment  
Feel this moment...  
I see the future but live for the moment, make sense don't it  
Now make dollars, I mean billions, im a genius, I mean brilliant  
This street is what scoot em  
And made em slicker, to slick with the ruler  
I've lost a lot, and learned a lot  
But i'm still undefeated like Zula  
I'm far from cheap, I break down companies with alll my peeps  
Baby we can travel the world  
And not given view, and all you can see  
Time is money  
Only difference is I own it, like a stop watch, let's stop time and enjoy this
moment  
One day when the light is glowing  
I’ll be in my castle golden  
But until the gates are open  
I just wanna feel this moment (ohhh)  
I just wanna feel this moment (ohhh)  
I just wanna feel this moment  
Come one, feel this moment....  
(ohhh) I just wanna feel this moment  
(ohhh) I just wanna feel this moment
