### We Might Be Dead By Tomorrow歌词：

Give me all your love now  
'Cause for all we know  
We might be dead by tomorrow

I can't  
Go on wasting my time  
Adding scars to my heart  
'Cause all I hear is  
"I'm not ready now"

And I can tell  
That you didn't have  
To face your mother  
losing her lover  
Without saying goodbye  
Without saying goodbye  
'Cause she didn't have time

I don't want to judge  
What's in your heart  
But if you're not ready for love  
How can you be ready for life?  
How can you be ready for life?

So let's love fully  
And let's love loud  
Let's love now  
'Cause soon enough we'll die  
'Cause soon enough we'll die  
'Cause soon enough we'll die  
'Cause soon enough we'll die  
'Cause soon enough we'll die  
'Cause soon enough we'll die
