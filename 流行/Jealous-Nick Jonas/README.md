### Jealous歌词：

I don’t like the way he’s looking at you,  
I’m starting to think you want him too.  
Am I crazy, Have I lost ya.  
Even though I know you love me,  
Can’t help it.  
(Bridge)  
I turn my cheek, music up,  
and I’m puffing my chest.  
I’m getting ready to face you,  
Can call me obsessed.  
It’s not your fault that they hover,  
I mean no disrespect.  
It’s my right to be hellish,  
I still get jealous.  
(Chorus)  
Cause you’re too sexy, beautiful,  
And everybody wants a taste.  
That’s why (that’s why)  
I still get jealous.  
(repeat x2)  
I wish you didn’t have to post it all,  
I wish you’d save a little bit just for me.  
Protective or possessive (yeah),  
Call it passive or aggressive.  
(back to bridge/chorus)  
You’re the only one invited,  
I said there’s no one else for you.  
Cause you know I get excited (yeah),  
When you get jealous too.  
I turn my cheek, music up,  
And I’m puffin’ my chest.  
I’m turning ready to face you,  
Can call me obsessed.  
It’s not your fault that they hover,  
I mean no disrespect.  
It’s my right to be hellish,  
I still get jealous.  
(chorus x2)  
Oh (that’s why)  
I still get jealous.  
(x2)
