### Doin' Time歌词：

Summertime and the livin's easy  
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras MG  
All people in the dance will agree  
That we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C  
Me me and Louie we gonna run to the party  
And dance to the rhythm it gets harder  
Me and my girl we got this relationship  
I love her so bad but she treats me like s**t  
On lockdown like a penitentiary  
She spreads her lovin' all over  
And when she gets home there's none left for me  
Summertime and the livin's easy  
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras MG  
All people in the dance will agree  
That we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C  
Me me and Louie we gonna run to the party  
And dance to the rhythm it gets harder  
Harder harder  
Oh take this veil from off my eyes  
My burning sun will some day rise  
So what am I gonna be doin' for a while  
Said I'm gonna play with myself  
Show them now we've come off the shelf  
Summertime and the livin's easy  
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras MG  
All people in the dance will agree  
That we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C  
Me me and Louie we gonna run to the party  
And dance to the rhythm it gets harder  
Harder harder  
Evil I've come to tell you that she's evil most definitely  
Evil ornery scandalous and evil most definitely  
The tension it's getting hotter  
I'd like to hold her head underwater  
Summertime  
Ah ah ah  
Summertime and the livin's easy  
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras MG  
All people in the dance will agree  
That we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C  
Me me and Louie we gonna run to the party  
And dance to the rhythm it gets harder
