### Merry Christmas歌词：

Build a fire and gather 'round the tree  
Fill a glass and maybe come and sing with me  
So kiss me under the mistletoe  
Pour out the wine let's toast and pray for December snow  
I know there's been pain this year but it's time to let it go  
Next year you never know  
But for now Merry Christmas  
We'll dance in the kitchen while embers glow  
We've both known love but this love we got is the best of all  
I wish you could see it through my eyes then you would know  
My God you look beautiful right now  
Merry Christmas  
The fire is raging on  
And we'll all sing along to the song  
Just having so much fun  
While we're here can we all spare a thought  
For the ones who have gone  
Merry Christmas everyone  
Ah ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah ah  
So just keep kissing me under the mistletoe  
Pour out the wine let's toast and pray for December snow  
I know there's been pain this year  
But it's time to let it go  
Next year you never know  
But for now Merry Christmas  
We'll dance in the kitchen while embers glow  
We've both known love  
But this love we got is the best of all  
I wish you could see it through my eyes  
Then you would know  
My God you look beautiful right now  
Merry Christmas  
I feel it when it comes  
Every year helping us carry on  
Filled up with so much love  
All the family and friends are together  
Where we all belong  
Merry Christmas everyone  
Ah ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah ah  
It's Christmas time for you and I  
We'll have a good night and a Merry Christmas  
It's Christmas time for you and I  
We'll have a good night and a Merry Christmas  
It's Christmas time for you and I  
We'll have a good night and a Merry Christmas  
It's Christmas time for you and I  
We'll have a good night and a Merry Christmastime
