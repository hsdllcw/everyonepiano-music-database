### 3AM Pull Up歌词：

[Charli XCX:]  
Ahh, da-da, ooh, your love  
Ahh, da-da, ooh, your love  
Yeah, I know, yeah, I know, yeah, I know  
I'll always remember you  
And I know, and I know, and I know  
I'll always care  
Even though, even though, even though  
It hurts what you put me through  
Holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on  
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one  
Who gets my head so fucked up  
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one  
Who makes me scream  
Even though, even though, even though  
It hurts what you put me through  
Holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on  
Yeah  
It's 3 A.M. and you are callin' (callin')  
You say you're sorry, but you're lonely (lonely)  
You know the words that got me fallin'  
I got to pull up, pull up  
Pull up, pull up  
Pull up, pull up right to your love  
One thousand times, the same old story (story)  
I hate myself, I can't control it (-trol it)  
You know the words that got me fallin'  
I got to pull up, pull up  
Pull up, pull up  
Pull up, pull up right to your love  
Ahh, da-da, ooh, your love  
Ahh, da-da, ooh, your love  
Ahh, da-da, ooh, your love  
Pull up, pull up  
Pull up, pull up  
Pull up, pull up right to your love  
Let it go, let it go, let it go  
My friends keep on tellin' me  
Let it go, let it go, let it go  
I just don't care  
Even though, even though, even though  
I know that you're usin' me  
Holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on  
Feelin' good, feelin' good, feelin' good  
It's better than ecstasy  
Feelin' good, feelin' good, feelin' good  
You take me there  
Even though, even though, even though  
I know this is bad for me  
Holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on  
Yeah  
It's 3 A.M. and you are callin' (callin')  
You say you're sorry, but you're lonely (lonely)  
You know the words that got me fallin'  
I got to pull up, pull up  
Pull up, pull up  
Pull up, pull up right to your love  
One thousand times, the same old story (story)  
I hate myself, I can't control it (-trol it)  
You know the words that got me fallin'  
I got to pull up, pull up  
Pull up, pull up  
Pull up, pull up right to your love  
Ahh, da-da, ooh, your love  
Ahh, da-da, ooh, your love  
Ahh, da-da, ooh, your love  
Pull up, pull up  
Pull up, pull up  
Pull up, pull up right to your love  
[MØ & Charli XCX:]  
In the beginning I thought you were amazing  
And none of my friends could stop me from chasin' you  
I was too blind to see through all the flames, babe  
But now, I don't wanna care anymore  
'Cause all the things you said to me, just a lie  
How could I be so dumb?  
I don't wanna care anymore  
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)  
You're just pretty, you're not free  
I'm so over your vanity  
Oh man, I don't wanna care anymore  
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)  
No, no, no, no  
It's 3 A.M. and you are callin' (callin')  
Go fuck yourself, don't say you're sorry (sorry)  
I can't believe I used to want this  
No more, no  
Pull up, pull up  
Pull up, pull up  
Pull up, pull up right to your love  
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)  
One thousand times, the same old story (story)  
Forgive myself, now this is over (over)  
I can't believe you had me fallin'  
No more, no  
Pull up, pull up  
Pull up, pull up  
Pull up, pull up right to your love  
Ahh, ahh, your love  
Da-da, ooh, your love  
Ahh, ahh, your love  
Da-da, ooh, your love  
Ahh, ahh, your love  
Da-da, ooh, your love  
Pull up, pull up  
Pull up, pull up  
Pull up, pull up right to your love
