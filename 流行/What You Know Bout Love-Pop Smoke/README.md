### What You Know Bout Love歌词：

Uh  
Shawty go jogging every morning  
Every morning  
And she make me breakfast almost every morning  
Every morning  
And she take a naked pic before she leave the door  
I be waking up to pics before a n***a yawning  
And every weekend my shawty comin' over  
Over  
Shawty could Fendi out but she like Fashion Nova  
Nova  
She ain't driving no Camry she pullin' in a Rover  
Rover  
With her hair so curly I love you baby  
She said What you know 'bout love  
I'll tell you everything  
I got what you need  
Oh  
Walk up in the store and get what you want  
Go get it  
You get what you please  
We 'bout to get it on take off them drawers  
I said I love you baby  
It's just you and me  
You know what I be on I'm about to go raw  
Love you baby  
'Cause I like what I see  
Look baby I said I ain't gon' front  
You got my heart beating so fast to words  
I can't pronounce  
And I be getting the chills every time  
I feel your touch  
I be looking at the top and girl it's only us  
All I need is your trust  
And girl I told you once  
Don't make me tell you twice  
I know you see this print through my pants T  
Hat I know you like  
And yo a*s be looking so fat  
When it be in them tights  
And I'm going straight to the top so hope  
You ain't afraid of heights  
You always keep me right for a fact you never left  
Through all the trials  
And tribulations always had my best  
So here's fifty-five hunnid go and get your breasts  
Start rubbin' on your butt start kissing on yo neck  
Hey batter batter hey batter batter  
N***as know I had to swing  
I had to make a play  
I had to apply the pressure  
'cause you my hidden treasure  
I think I'm falling in love  
She said What you know 'bout love  
I'll tell you everything  
I got what you need  
Oh  
Walk up in the store and get what you want  
Go get it  
You get what you please  
We 'bout to get it on take off them drawers  
I said I love you baby  
It's just you and me  
You know what I be on I'm about to go raw  
Love you baby  
'Cause I like what I see
