### Gonna Get Caught歌词：

You reeled me in with your smile  
You made me melt with your voice  
Now I've been gone now for awhile  
Just to find that I'm your seventh choice  
And I don't wanna pay the cost  
But it'd be best if you get lost  
Cause we know you'll never change

[Chorus:]  
Don't say that you need me  
And don't play these games with my mind  
You better get out of my head cause your wasting your time  
And don't say its forever  
And don't play cause you had your shot  
You better stop messing around cause you're gonna get caught

You promised me all of your time  
I guess I'm not the only one  
But see it's my heart on the line this time  
I'm your number one or I'm gone

[Chorus:]  
Don't say that you need me  
And don't play these games with my mind  
You better get out of my head cause your wasting your time  
And don't say its forever  
And don't play cause you had your shot  
You better stop messing around cause you're gonna get caught

Go and try to get me back  
I won't forget about our past  
I never had the guts to leave  
Now your making it  
Now your making it much easier for me to see

And don't say that you're sorry  
For breaking every inch of my heart  
I should've known from the start now it's time to get lost  
And don't say that you need me  
And don't play these games with my mind  
You better get out of my head cause your wasting your time  
And don't say its forever  
And don't play cause you had you shot  
You better stop messing around cause you're gonna get caught  
You better stop messing around cause you're gonna get caught.
