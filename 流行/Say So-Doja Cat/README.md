### Say So歌词：

Didn't have to know me keeping me in the moment  
I get you hot and moaning why don't you say so  
Didn't even notice no punches there to roll with  
You got to keep it focused you want it say so  
Didn't have to know me keeping me in the moment  
I get you hot and moaning why don't you say so  
Didn't even notice no punches there to roll with  
You got to keep it focused you want it say so  
It's been a long time since you  
Fell in love  
You ain't coming out your cell  
You really ain't been yourself  
Tell me what else I do  
You take my love  
'Cause luckily I'm good at reading  
I wanna fuck him but he won't stop chasin'  
And we can dance all day around it  
If you front then I'll be bouncing  
If you want it scream and shout it babe  
But fuck that if you try  
Didn't have to know me keeping me in the moment  
I get you hot and moaning why don't you say so  
Didn't even notice no punches there to roll with  
You got to keep it focused you want it say so  
Didn't have to know me keeping me in the moment  
I get you hot and moaning why don't you say so  
Didn't even notice no punches there to roll with  
You got to keep it focused you want it say so  
Let me check my chest my breath right quick  
He ain't never seen her in a dress like this  
He ain't never even been impressed like this  
Prolly why I got him quiet on the set like zip  
Like it love it need it bad  
Take it own it steal it fast  
Boy stop playing grab my ass  
Why you actin' like you shy  
Shut it save it keep it push  
Why you beating 'round the bush  
Knowing you want all this woman  
Never knock it 'til you try  
All of them bitches hating I have you with me  
All of my niggas saying you mad committed  
Realer than anybody you had and pretty  
All of that body I need ass and titties  
Didn't have to know me keeping me in the moment  
I get you hot and moaning why don't you say so  
Didn't even notice no punches there to roll with  
You got to keep it focused you want it say so  
Didn't have to know me keeping me in the moment  
I get you hot and moaning why don't you say so  
Didn't even notice no punches there to roll with  
You got to keep it focused you want it say so
