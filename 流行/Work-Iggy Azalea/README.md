### Work歌词：

Walk a mile in these Louboutins  
But they don't wear these shits  
where I'm from

I'm not hatin, I'm just telling you  
I'm tryna let you know  
what the fuck I've been through

Two feet in the red dirt, school skirt  
Sugar cane, back lanes  
3 jobs, took years to save  
But I got a ticket on that plane  
People got a lot to say  
But don't know shit bout where I was made  
Or how many floors that I had to scrub  
Just to make it past where I am from

No money, no family.  
16 in the middle of Miami.  
No money, no family.  
16 in the middle of Miami.  
No money, no family.  
16 in the middle of Miami.

I've been up all night,  
tryna get that rich  
I've been work work work work  
working on my shit

Milked the whole game twice  
gotta get it how I live  
I've been work work work work  
working on my shit  
Now get this work  
Now get this work  
Now get this work  
Now get this work work work work  
Working on my shit

You can hate it or love it  
Hustle and the struggle is  
the only thing I'm trusting  
Thoroughbred in a mud brick  
before the budget  
White chick on that Pac shit  
My passion was ironic  
And my dreams were uncommon  
Guess I gone crazy,  
First deal changed me  
Robbed blind basically raped me  
Ran through the bullshit like a matador  
Just made me madder  
and adamant to go at em  
And even the score  
So, I went harder  
Studied the Carters  
till a deal was offered  
Slept cold on the floor recording  
At 4 in the morning  
and now I'm passion the bar  
Like a lawyer  
Immigrant, art ignorant  
Ya ill intent was insurance for my benefit  
Hate be inconsiderate,  
but the industry took my innocence  
Too late, now I'm in this bitch!

You don't know the half  
This shit get real

Valley girls giving  
Blow jobs for Louboutins  
What do you call that?  
Head over heels

No money, no family.  
16 in the middle of Miami.  
No money, no family.  
16 in the middle of Miami.  
No money, no family.  
16 in the middle of Miami.

I've been up all night, tryna get that rich  
I've been work work work work  
working on my shit

Milked the whole game twice  
gotta get it how I live  
I've been work work work work  
working on my shit  
Now get this work  
Now get this work  
Now get this work

Now get this work work work work  
Working on my shit  
Pledge allegiance to the struggle  
Ain't been easy  
But cheers to Peezy for the weeks  
we lived out of duffel  
Bags is all we had  
Do anything for my Mum, I love you  
One day I'll pay you back  
For the sacrifice  
That ya managed to muscle  
16 you sent me through customs  
So….  
All aboard spaceship my to Mercury  
Turn First at the light that's in front of me  
Cause every night I'ma do it like my last

This dream is all that I need  
Cause it's all that I ever had  
Now get this work  
Now get this work  
Now get this work  
Now get this work  
Working on my shit  
Now get this work  
Now get this work  
Now get this work  
Now get this work work work work  
Working on my shit
