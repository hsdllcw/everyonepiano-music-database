### It's a Sin歌词：

When I look back upon my life  
It's always with a sense of shame  
I've always been the one to blame  
For everything I long to do  
No matter when or where or who  
Has one thing in common' too  
It's a' it's a' it's a' it's a sin  
It's a sin  
Everything I've ever done  
Everything I ever do  
Every place I've ever been  
Everywhere I'm going to  
It's a sin  
At school they taught me how to be  
So pure in thought and word and deed  
They didn't quite succeed  
For everything I long to do  
No matter when or where or who  
Has one thing in common' too  
It's a' it's a' it's a' it's a sin  
It's a sin  
Everything I've ever done  
Everything I ever do  
Every place I've ever been  
Everywhere I'm going to  
It's a sin  
Father' forgive me' I tried not to do it  
Turned over a new leaf' then tore right through it  
Whatever you taught me' I didn't believe it  
Father' you fought me' 'cause I didn't care  
And I still don't understand  
So I look back upon my life  
Forever with a sense of shame  
I've always been the one to blame  
For everything I long to do  
No matter when or where or who  
Has one thing in common' too  
It's a' it's a' it's a' it's a sin  
It's a sin  
Everything I've ever done  
Everything I ever do  
Every place I've ever been  
Everywhere I'm going to - it's a sin  
It's a' it's a' it's a' it's a sin  
It's a' it's a' it's a' it's a sin
