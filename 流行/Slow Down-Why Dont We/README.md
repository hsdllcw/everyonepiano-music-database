### Slow Down歌词：

Hey  
Oh oh oh  
Corbyn Besson：  
Oh I've been lying to myself  
And I might know why  
I miss the way you looked at me before  
You left New York  
Hey  
I've been tryin' to find help  
'Cause I can't deny  
The way that I feel when I'm with you  
Oh I'd do anything to save ya  
Daniel Seavey：  
I think we need a little California 'cation  
We took a shot at this but maybe we're too wasted  
It's hard to swallow but I know we gotta chase it oh  
Zach Herron：  
Slow down  
I think that we just need to slow down slow down  
Down down  
Turn around  
Things were so simple we were fallin' fallin'  
Jonah Marais：  
See ya I wanna see ya ah  
I wish you weren't so far so I could see ya ah  
See the light I wanna see the  
We were comfortable we didn't understand but now we know  
Jack Avery：  
I think we need a little California 'cation  
We took a shot at this but maybe we're too wasted  
It's hard to swallow but I know we gotta chase it oh  
Zach Herron/Daniel Seavey：  
Slow down  
I think that we just need to slow down slow down  
Down down  
Turn around  
Things were so simple we were fallin' fallin'  
Slow down  
I think that we just need to slow down slow down  
Woah  
Turn around  
Things were so simple we were fallin' fallin'  
Things were so simple we be fallin' down
