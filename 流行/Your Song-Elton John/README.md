**Your Song双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Your Song_ 是英国著名流行音乐创作歌手Elton
John的歌曲。1969年凭借此歌第一次挤身于英美流行榜前10名。70年代他推出大量优秀的流行歌曲，并取得了令人惊叹的成绩。他曾一连七张专辑荣获冠军，他的魅力感染了欧洲甚至前苏联。1974年至1975年间他处于巅峰时期，年收入达到了700万美元，
成为全球报酬最高的摇滚歌手，伦敦一家著名的杜沙夫人蜡像馆把他的蜡像与许多英国历史上大家熟悉的传奇人物安放在一起。他成了外号“乐坛大姑妈”的驰骋世界乐坛40年的超级常青树。甚至于，在传说中，他作为一位乐坛接班人，却让老掌门、披头士的首座约翰·列侬去机场接机时，竟然在看到他的时候跪了下来，口中念念有词：“哦天哪！是他！是他！是埃尔顿！”——虽然这个说法不能精确考证，但也不算空穴来风：列侬听过他的第一首畅销单曲《你的歌》之后，就认定他一定会大红大紫。后来，这首《Your
song》又被他人广为翻唱。

### Your Song歌词：

It's a little bit funny this feeling inside  
I'm not one of those who can easily hide  
I don't have much money but boy if I did  
I'd buy a big house where we both could live  
If I was a sculptor, but then again, no  
Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show  
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do  
My gift is my song and this one's for you  
And you can tell everybody this is your song  
It may be quite simple but now that it's done  
I hope you don't mind  
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words  
How wonderful life is while you're in the world  
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss  
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross  
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song  
It's for people like you that keep it turned on  
So excuse me forgetting but these things I do  
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue  
Anyway the thing is what I really mean  
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen  
And you can tell everybody this is your song  
It may be quite simple but now that it's done  
I hope you don't mind  
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words  
How wonderful life is while you're in the world  
I hope you don't mind  
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words  
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
