### Kid In Love歌词：

I know that we just met, and maybe this is dumb  
But it feels like there was something from the moment that we touched  
Cause it's alright, it's alright  
I wanna make you mine  
The way you're lighting up the room caught the corner of my eye  
We can both sneak out the back door, we don't have to say goodbye  
Cause it's alright, it's alright  
To waste time tonight  
Maybe I'm just a kid in love  
Maybe I'm just a kid in love, oh baby  
If this is what it's like fallin' in love  
Then I don't ever wanna grow up  
Maybe I'm just a kid in love  
Maybe I'm just a kid in love, oh baby  
It'd be cool if it was the two of us  
But I don't ever wanna grow up  
Cause I got it all  
And I got it all  
But I don't ever wanna grow up  
Said you place is kinda close, your parent are out of town  
Baby there's no pressure, but if you're down I'm down  
Cause it's alright, it's alright  
To just talk tonight  
If you're feeling kinda crazy, turn down the lights  
We can take our time, do whatever you like  
It's alright, it's alright  
I wanna make you mine  
Maybe I'm just a kid in love  
Maybe I'm just a kid in love, oh baby  
If this is what it's like fallin' in love  
Then I don't ever wanna grow up  
Maybe I'm just a kid in love  
Maybe I'm just a kid in love, oh baby  
It'd be fine if it was the two of us  
But I don't ever wanna grow up  
Cause I got it all  
And I got it all  
But I don't ever wanna grow up  
Cause I got it all  
And I got it all  
But I don't ever wanna grow up  
You make me feel  
Like I got it all  
And you make me feel  
Like I'm just a kid in love  
And you make me feel  
Like I got it all  
And you make me feel  
Like I don't ever wanna grow up  
Maybe we're just kids in love  
Maybe we're just kids in love, oh baby  
If this is what it's like falling in love  
Then we don't ever have to grow up  
Maybe we're just kids in love  
Maybe we're just kids in love, oh baby  
When we're alone and it's the two of us  
I can't get enough  
I've got it all, yeah yeah, I've got it all, yeah  
And I've got it, and I've got it all  
And I've got it, and we've got it all  
And I've got it, and I've got it all, but I don't ever wanna grow up
