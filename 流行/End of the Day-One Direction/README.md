### End of the Day歌词：

[Harry:]  
I told her that I loved her, was not sure if she heard  
The roof was pretty windy and she didn't say a word  
Party dying downstairs, had nothing left to do  
Just me, her and the moon

[Niall:]  
I said you're on fire babe then down came the lightning on me  
Love can be frightening for sure

[All:]  
All I know at the end of the day  
Is you want what you want and you say what you say  
And you'll follow your heart even though it'll break  
Sometimes  
All I know at the end of the day  
Is you love who you love, there ain't no other way  
If there's something I've learnt from a million mistakes  
You're the one that I want at the end of the day

At the end of the day  
You're the one that I want at the end of the day

[Liam:]  
Said the night was over, I said it's forever  
20 minutes later, wound up in the hospital  
The priest thinks it's the devil, my mum thinks it's the flu  
But girl it's only you

[Louis:]  
I said you're on fire babe then down came the lightning on me  
Love can be frightening for sure

[All:]  
All I know at the end of the day  
Is you want what you want and you say what you say  
And you'll follow your heart even though it'll break  
Sometimes  
All I know at the end of the day  
Is you love who you love, there ain't no other way  
If there's something I've learnt from a million mistakes  
You're the one that I want at the end of the day

[Louis:]  
When the sun goes down I know that you and me and everything will be alright  
And when the city's sleeping  
You and I can stay awake and keep on dreaming  
You and I can stay awake and keep on dreaming

[Harry:]  
All I know at the end of the day  
Is you want what you want and you say what you say  
And you'll follow your heart even though it'll break  
Sometimes

[All:]  
All I know at the end of the day  
Is you love who you love, there ain't no other way  
If there's something I've learnt from a million mistakes  
You're the one that I want at the end of the day

At the end of the day  
You're the one that I want at the end of the day  
You're the one that I want at the end of the day
