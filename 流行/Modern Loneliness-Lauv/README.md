流行乐坛先锋人物 Lauv的《 **Modern Loneliness**
》是一首充满活力的歌曲，写给每个因科技的联接朝夕相伴，却各自孤独的我们。该曲亦将收录于3月6日即将发行的专辑《How I'm Feeling》。

Lauv在新专介绍时曾说，专辑起始于郁郁寡欢，自我质疑的灰暗时光，结束于平和释然的快乐生活。

简单的钢琴伴奏, 婉转的曲调, 伤感却真挚, 娓娓道来。 _Modern Loneliness_
作为全新专辑的尾曲，就像是一部小小人生阶段的反思与总结。经历了从谷底到全然表达和接受自己，Lauv也在慢慢成长，慢慢释然，慢慢通透。

同时，网站还为大家提供了《[ **I'm So Tired...**](Music-10165-Im-So-Tired-Lauv和Troye-

### Modern Loneliness歌词：

I've been thinking about my father lately  
The person that he made me  
The person I've become  
And I've been trying to fill all of this empty  
But f**k I'm still so empty  
Yeah I could use some love  
And I've been trying to find a reason to get up  
Been trying to find a reason for this stuff  
In my bedroom and my closet  
The baggage in my heart is still so dark  
Modern loneliness we're never alone  
But always depressed yeah  
Love my friends to death  
But I never call I never text  
La di da di da yeah  
You get what you give and you give what you get so  
Modern loneliness  
We love to get high  
But we don't know how to come down  
If I could break my DNA to pieces rid of all my demons  
If I could cleanse my soul  
Then I could fill the world with all my problems  
But s**t that wouldn't solve them  
So I'm left here alone  
And I've been trying to find a reason to get up  
Been trying to find a reason for this stuff  
In my bedroom and my closet  
The baggage in my heart is still so dark  
Modern loneliness  
We're never alone but always depressed yeah  
Love my friends to death  
But I never call I never text  
La di da di da yeah  
You get what you give and you give what you get so  
Modern loneliness  
We love to get high  
But we don't know how to come down  
Down down down down down  
We don't know how to come down  
Down down down down down  
We don't know how to come down  
Down down down down down  
We don't know how to come down  
Down down down down down  
We don't know how to come down  
Modern loneliness  
We're never alone but always depressed yeah  
Love my friends to death but I never call I never text  
La di da di da yeah  
You get what you give and you give what you get so  
Modern loneliness  
We love to get high  
But we don't know how to come down  
Down down down down down  
We don't know how to come down  
Down down down down down  
We don't know how to come down  
Down down down down down  
We don't know how to come down  
Down down down down down  
We don't know how to come down  
Modern loneliness we're never alone  
But we're always depressed yeah
