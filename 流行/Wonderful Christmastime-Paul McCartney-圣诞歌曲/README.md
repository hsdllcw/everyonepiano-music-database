**Wonderful Christmastime双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Wonderful Christmastime_ 是一首圣诞歌曲，由英国歌手Paul McCartney演唱。作为披头士的创作核心，Paul
McCartney创作旋律的能力和John
Lennon的思想造就了乐队的经典。如果说，Lennon以其深刻的歌词、鲜明的时尚态度、离奇的死因而被看作披头士的灵魂，那么McCartney就是用动听的旋律、沉郁的嗓音打造了披头士的骨血。

### Wonderful Christmastime歌词：

The moon is right  
The spirit's up  
We're here tonight  
And that's enough  
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time  
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time  
The party's on  
The feelin's here  
That only comes  
This time of year  
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time  
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time  
The choir of children sing their song  
Ding dong ding dong  
Ding dong ding oh oh  
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time  
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time  
The word is out  
About the town  
To lift a glass  
Ah don't look down  
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time  
The choir of children sing their song  
They practiced all year long  
Ding dong ding dong  
Ding dong ding dong  
Ding dong ding dong  
The party's on  
The spirit's up  
We're here tonight  
And that's enough  
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time  
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time  
The moon is right  
The spirit's up  
We're here tonight  
And that's enough  
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time  
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time  
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time  
Oh Christmas time
