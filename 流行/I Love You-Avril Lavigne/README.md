### I Love You歌词：

lala lalalala lala lalala  
I like your smile  
I like your vibe  
I like your style  
But that's not why I love you  
And I I like the way, you're such a star  
But that's not why I love you, hey  
Do you feel, do you feel me do you feel what I feel too  
Do you need, do you need me do you need me-e-e  
You're so beautiful  
But that's not why I love you  
I'm not sure you know  
That the reason I love you is you  
Being you just you  
Yea the reason I love you  
Is all that we've been through  
And that's why I love you  
lala lalalala lala lalala  
I like the way you misbehave  
When we get wasted  
But that's not why I love you  
And how you keep your cool when I am complicated  
But that's not why I love you hey

Do you feel do you feel me do you feel what I feel too  
Do you need do you need me do you need me-e-e  
You're so beautiful  
But that's not why I love you  
And I'm not sure you know  
That the reason I love you is you  
Being you just you  
Yea the reason I love you  
Is all that we've been through  
And that's why I love you  
Yeaaa  
ohhhh ohhhh  
Even though we didn't make it through  
I am always here for you  
yea-a-a  
You're so beautiful  
But that's not why I love you  
I'm not sure you know  
That the reason I love you, is you  
Being you, just you  
Yea the reason I love you  
Is all that we've been through  
And that's why I love you  
la la la la la la (oh ohhh)  
la la la la la la (that's why I love you)  
la la la la la la (oh ohhh)  
la la la la la la (that's why I love you)
