**圣诞快乐** 最早是电影的插曲，是由Judy Garland茱蒂嘉兰在1944年电影 相逢圣路易(Meet Me in ST.
Louis)的一首歌，随著时代的变化， _圣诞快乐_ 也被不同的歌星以不同的曲风所演绎著。

### Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas英文歌词：

Have yourself a merry little Christmas

Let your heart be light

From now on

Our troubles will be out of sight (my Lord)

Have yourself a merry little Christmas

Make the Yuletide gay

From now on

Our troubles will be miles away

Here we are as in olden days

Happy golden days of yore

Faithful friends who are dear to us

Gather near to us once more

Through the years

We all will be together

If the Fates allow (allow)

Hang a shining star

Upon the highest bough

And have yourself

A merry little Christmas right now

Have yourself

A merry little Christmas

Have yourself

A merry little Christmas

now!!!~~~~~~~
