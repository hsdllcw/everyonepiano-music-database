**White Houses** 是美国独立创作女歌手Vanessa Carlton的歌曲，收录在其第二张录音室专辑《Harmonium》中。

2004年8月， _White Houses_ 派出电台，并在Billboard Hot
100单曲达到86名。但是，这首歌的歌词非常的有争议，所以在MV审查后这支音乐视频以及单曲被禁播。瓦妮莎的争议涉及到珍妮•杰克逊在第三十八届超级碗半场表演发生的一些事情。10月21日，瓦妮莎的专辑《Harmonium》发行，首周在美国Billboard200专辑榜达到33名和后迅速下降，截至2006年2月份，这张专辑都还没买到150000张。制作完专辑后，瓦妮莎开始在北美洲开始巡回演唱会，从10月21日开始到11月21日结束，她的巡演票房只有几百万美元。第二场巡回演出，与Cary
Brothers和Ari Hest一起，从2005年3月9日持续到4月30日。

### White Houses歌词：

Crashed on the floor when I moved in  
This little bungalow with some strange new friends  
Stay up too late, and I'm too thin  
We promise each other it's til the end  
Now we're spinning empty bottles  
It's the five of us  
With pretty eyed boys girls die to trust  
I can't resist the day  
No, I can't resist the day  
Jenny screams out and it's no pose  
'Cause when she dances she goes and goes  
Beer through the nose on an inside joke  
I'm so excited, I haven't spoken  
And she's so pretty, and she's so sure  
Maybe I'm more clever than a girl like her  
The summer's all in bloom  
The summer is ending soon  
It's alright and it's nice not to be so alone  
But I hold on to your secrets in white houses  
But I hold on to your secrets in white houses  
Maybe I'm a little bit over my head  
I come undone at the things he said  
And he's so funny in his bright red shirt  
We were all in love and we all got hurt  
I sneak into his car's cracked leather seat  
The smell of gasoline in the summer heat  
Boy, we're going way too fast  
It's all too sweet to last  
It's alright  
And I put myself in his hands  
Love, or something ignites in my veins  
And I pray it never fades in white houses  
My first time, hard to explain  
Rush of blood, oh, and a little bit of pain  
On a cloudy day, it's more common than you think  
He's my first mistake  
Maybe you were all faster than me  
Give each other up so easily  
These silly little wounds will never mend  
I feel so far from where I've been  
So I go, and I will not be back here again  
I'm gone as the day is fading on white houses  
I lie, put my injuries all in the dust  
In my heart is the five of us  
In white houses  
In white houses  
In white houses  
And you, maybe you'll remember me  
What I gave is yours to keep  
In white houses
