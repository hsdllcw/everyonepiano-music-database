### Us Against the World歌词：

Oh morning come bursting the clouds, amen  
Lift off this blindfold, let me see again  
And bring back the water, let your ships roll in  
In my heart she left a hole

The tightrope that I'm walking just sways and ties  
The devil, as he's talking, with those angel's eyes  
And I just want to be there when the lightning strikes  
And the saints go marching in

And sing slow it down  
Through chaos as it swirls  
It's us against the world

Like a river to a raindrop  
I lost a friend  
My drunken hazard Daniel in a lion's den  
And tonight I know it all has to begin again  
So whatever you do  
Don't let go

And if we could float away  
Fly up to the surface and just start again  
And lift off before trouble just erodes us in the rain  
Just erodes us in the rain  
Just erodes us and see roses in the rain

And sing slow it down  
Slow it down

Through chaos as it swirls  
It's us against the world  
Through chaos as it swirls  
It's us against the world
