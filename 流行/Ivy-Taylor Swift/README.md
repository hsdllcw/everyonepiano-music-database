### Ivy歌词：

How's one to know  
I'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones  
In a faith forgotten land  
In from the snow  
Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow  
Tarnished but so grand  
And the old widow goes to the stone every day  
But I don't I just sit here and wait  
Grieving for the living  
Oh godd**n  
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand  
Taking mine but it's been promised to another  
Oh I can't  
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland  
My house of stone your ivy grows  
And now I'm covered in you  
I wish to know  
The fatal flaw that makes you long to be  
Magnificently cursed  
He's in the room  
Your opal eyes are all I wish to see  
He wants what's only yours  
Oh godd**n  
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand  
Taking mine but it's been promised to another  
Oh I can't  
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland  
My house of stone your ivy grows  
And now I'm covered  
Clover blooms in the fields  
Spring breaks loose the time is near  
But what would he do if he found us out  
Crescent moon coast is clear  
Spring breaks loose but so does fear  
He's gonna burn this house to the ground  
How's one to know  
I'd live and die for moments that we stole  
On begged and borrowed time  
So tell me to run  
Or dare to sit and watch what we'll become  
And drink my husband's wine  
Oh godd**n  
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand  
Taking mine but it's been promised to another  
Oh I can't  
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland  
My house of stone your ivy grows  
And now I'm covered in you  
And I'm covered in you  
So yeah it's a fire  
It's a godd**n blaze in the dark  
And you started it  
You started it  
So yeah it's a war  
It's the godd**n fight of my life  
And you started it  
You started it  
Oh I can't  
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland  
My house of stone your ivy grows  
And now I'm covered in you  
In you  
Now I'm covered in you  
In you
