### Panda歌词：

This what they all been waiting for  
I guess so  
They been waiting for this shit for a long time didn't they  
I'ma give it everything I got  
Ayo Dougie park that X6 around the corner  
Aye I'm just feeling my vibe right now

Panda, Panda  
Panda, Panda, Panda, Panda, Panda

I got broads in Atlanta  
Twisting dope, lean, and the Fanta  
Credit cards and the scammers  
Hitting off licks in the bando  
Black X6, Phantom  
White X6 looks like a panda  
Going out like I'm Montana  
Hundred killers, hundred hammers
