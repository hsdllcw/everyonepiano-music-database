### Earth Song歌词：

What about sunrise  
What about rain  
What about all the things  
That you said we were to gain...  
What about killing fields  
Is there a time  
What about all the things  
That you said was yours and mine...  
Did you ever stop to notice  
All the blood we've shed before  
Did you ever stop to notice  
This crying Earth, this weeping shore?

Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh  
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh

What have we’ve done to the world  
Look what we've done  
What about all the peace  
That you pledge your only son...  
What about flowering fields  
Is there a time  
What about all the dreams  
That you said was yours and mine...  
Did you ever stop to notice  
All the children dead from war  
Did you ever stop to notice  
This crying Earth, this weeping shore?

Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh  
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh  
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh

I used to dream  
I used to glance beyond the stars  
Now I don't know where we are  
Although I know we've drifted far

Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh  
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh  
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh  
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh

Hey, what about yesterday  
(What about us)  
What about the seas  
(What about us)  
The heavens are falling down  
(What about us)  
I can't even breathe  
(What about us)  
What about apathy  
(What about us)  
I need you  
(What about us)  
What about nature's worth  
(ooo, ooo)  
It's our planet's womb  
(What about us)  
What about animals  
(What about it)  
Turned kingdoms to dust  
(What about us)  
What about elephants  
(What about us)  
Have we lost their trust  
(What about us)  
What about crying whales  
(What about us)  
Ravaging the seas  
(What about us)  
What about forest trails  
(ooo, ooo)  
Burnt despite our pleas  
(What about us)  
What about the holy land  
(What about it)  
Torn apart by creed  
(What about us)  
What about the common man  
(What about us)  
Can't we set him free  
(What about us)  
What about children dying  
(What about us)  
Can't you hear them cry  
(What about us)  
Where did we go wrong  
(ooo, ooo)  
Someone tell me why  
(What about us)  
What about baby boy  
(What about it)  
What about the days  
(What about us)  
What about all their joy  
(What about us)  
What about the man  
(What about us)  
What about the crying man  
(What about us)  
What about Abraham  
(What about us)  
What about death again  
(ooo, ooo)  
Do we give a damn  
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh
