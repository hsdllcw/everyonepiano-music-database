**We're Good** 是由英国女歌手Dua Lipa录唱的一首歌曲，被收录在其第二张录音室专辑《Future
Nostalgia》的月光版唱片，为其所属专辑中的第13首歌曲。

强烈的Trap曲风牢牢抓住听者的耳朵。鲜明的节奏，悦动的韵律感就像是一条支线，把各种元素巧妙的穿在一起
，随时都是诱人起舞的复古摩登歌曲。同时，层层递进的醇厚嗓音，久久环绕，余音盘旋构筑梦境，不小心就坠入Lipa的歌声里。

### We're Good歌词：

I'm on an island even when you're close  
Can't take the silence I'd rather be alone  
I think it's pretty plain and simple we gave it all we could  
It's time I wave goodbye from the window  
Let's end this like we should and say we're good  
We're not meant to be like sleeping and c*****e  
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways  
How can I judge you when you're with somebody else  
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself  
Let's end it like we should and say we're good  
No need to hide it go get what you want  
This won't be a burden if we both don't hold a grudge  
I think it's pretty plain and simple we gave it all we could  
It's time I wave goodbye from the window  
Let's end this like we should and say we're good  
We're not meant to be like sleeping and c*****e  
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways  
How can I judge you when you're with somebody else  
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself  
Let's end it like we should and say we're good  
Now you're holding this against me like I knew you would  
I'm trying my best to make this easy  
So don't give me that look just say we're good  
We're not meant to be like sleeping and c*****e  
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways oh  
How can I judge you when you're with somebody else  
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself  
Let's end it like we should and say we're good
