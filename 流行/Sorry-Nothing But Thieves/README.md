### Sorry歌词：

You might kill me with desire  
Wind me tighter than a wire  
It's something that you do to me  
I run away like mercury  
And I know you think it's rough  
When you're tryna patch us up  
And I say honey what is love  
You just say I drink too much  
Maybe I'm defective  
Or maybe I'm dumb  
I'm sorry so sorry for what I've done  
Maybe I'm bad natured  
Or maybe I'm young  
I'm sorry so sorry for what I've done  
And I'm the t-shirt that I wear  
I'm pick the thorns out of my hair  
I broke your heart so carelessly  
But made the pieces part of me  
And now it hurts what we've become  
'Cause you taught me how to love  
It's me who taught you how to stop  
And you just say I drink too much  
Maybe I'm defective  
Or maybe I'm dumb  
I'm sorry so sorry for what I've done  
Maybe I'm bad natured  
Or maybe I'm young  
I'm sorry so sorry for what I've done  
I've waited for this  
I'm ready for it  
I've waited for this  
I'm ready for it  
I've been waiting so long  
I've waited for this  
I'm ready for it  
I've waited for this  
I'm ready for it  
I've been waiting so long  
Maybe I'm defective  
Or maybe I'm dumb  
I'm sorry so sorry for what I've done  
Maybe I'm bad natured  
Or maybe I'm young  
I'm sorry so sorry for what I've done
