### Drown歌词：

I've been tryna keep my distance  
But in an instant you break me down  
I know better than to want you  
But I succumb to you without a doubt  
Now the water is rising  
And I'm too tired to swim  
And my lungs just can't take it  
But I keep breathing you in so  
Tell me lies  
Tell me painted truths  
Anything at all to keep me close to you  
Pull me under  
The way you do  
Tonight I wanna drown in an ocean of you  
Anything at all to keep me close to you  
Tonight I wanna drown in an ocean of you  
Tonight I wanna drown in an ocean of you  
Tonight I wanna drown in an ocean of you  
I'm so used to your excuses  
That when you bruise me I stick around  
No point trying to make it out now  
Rather be sinking than go without  
And now the water is rising  
And I'm too tired to swim  
And my lungs just can't take it  
But I keep breathing you in so  
Tell me lies  
Tell me painted truths  
Anything at all to keep me close to you  
Pull me under  
The way you do  
Tonight I wanna drown in an ocean of you  
Anything at all to keep me close to you  
Tonight I wanna drown in an ocean of you  
Tonight I wanna drown in an ocean of you  
Tonight I wanna drown in an ocean of you  
Tell me lies  
Tell me painted truths  
Anything at all to keep me close to you  
Pull me under  
The way you do  
Tonight I wanna drown in an ocean of you
