### Save Myself歌词：

God d**n  
Hindsight 2020  
Poured rain  
All over my sunny  
Someday  
This will all be funny  
We were  
C*****e  
Playing milk and honey  
Dysfunctional  
I was a junkie  
Someday  
This will all be funny  
I know everything worked out the way it's meant to be  
But honestly  
If I had the chance  
I would take it back  
Jumping off your sinking ship  
Instead of going down with it  
One day I'll be good  
Right now I'm just mad  
Over being so mature  
If only I was never yours  
I could have  
Saved myself  
Time and lots of money  
Could've saved myself  
I shouldn't blame myself  
I kinda saw it coming  
Could've saved myself  
From you  
Red flags  
Tended to ignore them  
White flag  
Never sent it soaring  
So hard to forget it  
In the morning  
I know everything worked out the way it's meant to be  
But honestly  
If I had the chance  
I would take it back  
Jumping off your sinking ship  
Instead of going down with it  
One day I'll be good  
Right now I'm just mad  
Over being so mature  
If only I was never yours  
I could have  
Saved myself  
Time and lots of money  
Could've saved myself  
I shouldn't blame myself  
I kinda saw it coming  
Could've saved myself  
From you  
I could have saved myself  
From wasting half my twenties  
Saved myself  
From you  
I could have  
Saved myself  
Time and lots of money  
Could've saved myself  
I shouldn't blame myself  
I kinda saw it coming  
Could've saved myself  
From you
