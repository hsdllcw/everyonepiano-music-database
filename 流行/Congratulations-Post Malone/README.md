### Congratulations歌词：

[Post Malone:]  
My mama called, "Seen you on TV, son."  
Said shit done changed ever since we was on  
I dreamed it all ever since I was young  
They said I wouldn't be nothing  
Now they always say congratulations  
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation  
They ain't never had the dedication  
People hatin', say we changed and look we made it  
Yeah, we made it  
They was never friendly, yeah  
Now I'm jumping out the Bentley, yeah  
And I know I sound dramatic, yeah  
But I know I had to have it, yeah  
For the money, I'm a savage, yeah  
I be itching like a addict, yeah  
I'm surrounded 20 bad bitches, yeah  
But they didn't know me last year, yeah  
Everyone wanna act like they important  
(Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)  
But all that mean nothing when I saw my dough  
(Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)  
Everyone counting on me, drop the ball  
(Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)  
Everything custom like I'm at the border, yeah, yeah  
If you fuck with winning, put your lighters to the sky  
How could I make sense/cents when I got millions on my mind?  
Coming with that bullshit, I just put it to the side  
Balling since a baby, they could see it in my eyes  
My mama called, "Seen you on TV, son."  
Said shit done changed ever since we was on  
I dreamed it all ever since I was young  
They said I wouldn't be nothing  
Now they always say congratulations  
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation  
They ain't never had the dedication  
People hatin', say we changed and look we made it  
Yeah, we made it  
[Quavo:]  
I was patient, yeah-oh  
I was patient, ay-oh  
Now I can scream that we made it  
Now everyone, everywhere I go, they say 'gratulations  
Young nigga, young nigga, graduation  
I pick up the rock and I ball, baby  
I'm looking for someone to call, baby  
But right now I got a situation  
Never old Ben-Ben Franklins  
Big rings, champagne  
My life is like a ball game  
But instead I'm in the trap, though  
Pot so big, call it Super Bowl  
Super Bowl, call the hoes, get in the Rolls  
Top floor lifestyle, Huncho and Post  
Malone, I got a play on my phone, ay  
You know what I'm on, ay  
Huncho Houdini is gone, ay  
[Post Malone:]  
My mama called, "Seen you on TV, son."  
Said shit done changed ever since we was on  
I dreamed it all ever since I was young  
They said I wouldn't be nothing  
Now they always say congratulations  
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation  
They ain't never had the dedication  
People hatin', say we changed and look we made it  
Yeah, we made it
