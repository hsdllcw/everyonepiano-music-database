### Dear Boy歌词：

So bold and fine,  
I've known you for some time  
Whole life changed while  
bones like yours and mine  
Go dance in the woods  
and down we go, down, down  
Oh boy, you're mine,  
do you remember old times?  
Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you  
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl, too  
Oh dear boy, it's so hollow without you  
In a world with everything but it won't do  
Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you  
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl, too  
Oh, dear boy, it's so shallow without you  
It's a chance, boy, everything I ask of you  
Sweet love of mine,  
destruction ain't a crime  
For those who find love  
as a game like you and I  
Go dance in the waters of  
all the tears we have cried  
Oh boy, we're fine,  
do you remember our time?  
Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you  
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl, too  
Oh dear boy, it's so hollow without you  
In a world with everything but it won't do  
Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you  
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl, too  
Oh, dear boy, it's so shallow without you  
It's a chance, boy, everything I ask of you
