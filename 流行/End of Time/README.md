### End of Time歌词：

When things are right then you just know  
There is something in your eyes that brings me home  
Cuz when there's love you don't let go  
So as long as you're with me you're not alone you'll never be  
I wanna tell you what I feel and really mean it  
I wanna shout it from the rooftops to the sky  
Cus if you ever need a friend  
You know I'll be it from tonight until we see the end of time  
I'll cross my heart  
And hope to die  
We're always and forever I'll be by your side  
When days are dark  
And stars don't line  
We're always and forever 'til the end- the end of time  
When we look back and when we're old  
We'll see your footprints next to mine along the road  
And I don't know what the future holds  
But as long as you're with me you're not alone you'll never be  
I wanna tell you what I feel and really mean it  
I wanna shout it from the rooftops to the sky  
Cus if you ever need a friend  
You know I'll be it from tonight until we see the end of time  
I'll cross my heart  
And hope to die  
We're always and forever I'll be by your side  
When days are dark  
And stars don't line  
We're always and forever 'til the end- the end of time  
I'll cross my heart  
And hope to die  
We're always and forever I'll be by your side  
When days are dark  
And stars don't line  
We're always and forever 'til the end- the end of time  
We're always and forever 'til the end- the end of time
