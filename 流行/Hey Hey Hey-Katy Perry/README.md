Katy
Perry在这张专辑的封面搞上怪的将双眼遮住，嘴中有一只眼睛，其实富有意涵，Katy表示，在音乐事业历程中，她学习到很多新事物，“这些成就是借由“唱歌”来展现的，而这就是她看世界的方式。同时，Katy也希望自己的歌迷也能够透过这个方式来“见证”她自己，所以才想到要把眼睛放到嘴巴里”。

### Hey Hey Hey歌词：

A big beautiful brain with a pretty face, yeah  
A baby doll with a briefcase, yeah  
A hot little hurricane  
'Cause I'm feminine and soft, but I'm still a boss, yeah  
Red lipstick but still so raw, yeah  
Marilyn Monroe in a monster truck  
'Cause I can be zen and I can be the storm, yeah  
I smell like a rose and I pierce like a thorn, yeah  
Karate chopping, the clichés and norms, all in a dress  
Hey, hey, hey  
You think that I'm a little ba-a-by  
You think that I am fragile like a Fabergé  
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me  
No-o-o-o-oh, no way  
No-o-o-o-oh, no way  
No-o-o-o-oh, no way  
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me  
Break break, break me  
Yeah, I bounce back like a pro 'cause I'm so resilient  
LOL at all your limits  
Keep your penny thoughts, I'm making a mint  
'Cause I can be zen and I can be the storm, yeah  
I smell like a rose and I pierce like a thorn, yeah  
Karate chopping, the clichés and norms, all in a dress  
Hey, hey, hey  
You think that I'm a little ba-a-by  
You think that I am fragile like a Fabergé  
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me  
No-o-o-o-oh, no way  
No-o-o-o-oh, no way  
No-o-o-o-oh, no way  
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me  
Break break, break me  
I ain't got no strings  
(No strings, no strings, no strings)  
I'm no one's little puppet  
Got my own cha ching  
In my chubby little wallet  
And secretly you love it  
(You fucking love it)  
And secretly you love it  
Hey, hey, hey  
You think that I'm a little ba-a-by  
You think that I am fragile like a Fabergé  
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me  
No-o-o-o-oh  
Hey, hey, hey  
You think that I'm a little ba-a-by  
You think that I am fragile like a Fabergé  
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me  
No-o-o-o-oh, no way (no)  
No-o-o-o-oh, no way (no way)  
No-o-o-o-oh, no way  
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me  
Break break, break me
