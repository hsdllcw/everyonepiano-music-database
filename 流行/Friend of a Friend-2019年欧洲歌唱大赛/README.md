### Friend of a Friend歌词：

Can you hear it  
There's someone behind the wall making the same sounds  
Can you hear it  
It sounds like you and me when we're making love  
Who is it  
You said you wish they weren't taking such a long time  
She was my neighbour when we were thirteen  
She moved back in  
There's not much between us now  
Do you know what I mean  
She's only a friend of a friend of a friend  
Of a friend  
She's never home 'cause she plays in a band  
I don't know if you'd understand  
She's only a friend of a friend of a friend  
I had a dream that she walked through the door  
I can't recall her name anymore  
Please believe me I'm your man  
She's only a friend of a friend of a friend  
I'm only a friend  
Can you feel it  
There's someone sliding up and down the ceiling  
Breathing he is synchronizing with her beating heart  
With her beating heart  
She was my neighbour when we were thirteen  
She moved back in  
There's not much between us now  
Do you know what I mean  
She's only a friend of a friend  
Of a friend of a friend  
She's never home 'cause she plays in a band  
I don't know if you'd understand  
She's only a friend of a friend of a friend  
I had a dream that she walked through the door  
I can't recall her name anymore  
Please believe me I'm your man  
She's only a friend of a friend of a friend  
I'm only a friend  
I'm only a friend  
She's only a friend of a friend  
Of a friend of a friend  
She's never home 'cause she plays in a band  
I don't know if you'd understand  
She's only a friend of a friend of a friend  
I had a dream that she walked through the door  
I can't recall her name anymore  
Please believe me I'm your man  
She's only a friend of a friend of a friend
