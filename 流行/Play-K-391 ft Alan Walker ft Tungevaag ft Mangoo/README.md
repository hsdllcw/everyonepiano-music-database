_Play_ 是由挪威DJ、音乐制作人Alan Walker、K-391、Martin Tungevaag和DJ
Mangoo合作的歌曲，单曲于2019年8月30日通过LIQUID STATE LIMITED发行。

歌曲采样于由瑞典制作人Mangoo创作并火爆全球的原曲
“Eurodancer”。原曲于2000年推出时，在各大音乐节及派对上掀起强劲热潮，现仍在众多场合广泛播放。如今三大制作人将该曲重新改编，融合了多元的风格：faded的变奏，ignite标志的beat，wicked
wonderland的drum以及《Eurodancer》本身的特色。空灵空灵而轻快的lead为电音添加了几分神秘，柔和不失爆点的vocal为电音锦上添花，复合的drum将间奏点缀的淋漓尽致，后半部分若隐若现的人声及递进的lead再次推向高潮，最后戛然而止，神秘世界大门就此关上。本单制作精良，别出心裁，制作毫不拖泥带水，又融合了多种风格。相信这一单会有上佳的表现。

### Play歌词：

We used to hide under the covers  
Serenade each other with careless melodies  
Something buried deep inside us  
The major and the minor  
We're like piano keys  
You played for me  
You played for me  
You played for me  
I swear it  
Even in my sleep I hear it  
Like the memory of every thing we used to be  
You played for me  
You played for me  
You played for me  
We couldn't stop the world from turning  
It was like a whirlwind  
Scattered us like leaves  
But I'm stuck inside a feeling  
The song that never leaves  
We were like a symphony  
You played for me  
You played for me  
You played for me  
I swear it  
Even in my sleep I hear it  
Like the memory of every thing we used to be  
You played for me  
You played for me  
You played for me  
You and me  
You and me me  
You and me me  
You and me  
You and me me  
You and me  
You played for me  
I swear it  
Even in my sleep I hear it  
Like the memory of every thing we used to be  
You played for me
