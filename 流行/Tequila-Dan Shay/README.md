### Tequila歌词：

I can still shut down a party  
I can hang with anybody  
I can drink whiskey and red wine  
Champagne all night  
Little Scotch on the rocks and I'm fine I'm fine  
But when I taste tequila baby I still see ya  
Cutting up the floor in a sorority T-Shirt  
The same one you wore when we were  
Sky high in Colorado your lips pressed against the bottle  
Swearing on a Bible baby I'd never leave ya  
I remember how bad I need ya when I taste tequila  
When I taste tequila  
I can kiss somebody brand new and not even think about you  
I can show up to the same bar  
Hear the same songs in my car  
Baby your memory it only hits me this hard  
When I taste tequila baby I still see ya  
Cutting up the floor in a Serotta T-shirt  
The same one you wore when we were  
Sky high in Colorado your lips pressed against the bottle  
Swearing on a Bible baby I'd never leave ya  
I remember how bad I need ya when I taste Tequila  
When I taste Tequila  
I ain't even drunk I ain't even drunk  
And I'm thinking  
How I need your love how I need your love  
Yeah it sinks in  
When I taste tequila baby I still see ya  
Sorority T-shirt the same one you wore when we were  
Sky high in Colorado your lips pressed against the bottle  
Swearing on a Bible baby I'd never leave ya  
I remember how bad I need ya when I taste tequila  
When I taste tequila  
When I taste tequila  
When I taste tequila
