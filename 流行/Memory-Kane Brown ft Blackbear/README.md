### Memory歌词：

All：  
Yeah yeah yeah-ayy yeah  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh-ooh  
Ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh  
I wanna live life fast  
I don't know how to slow down  
I wanna get high  
I don't know how to come down  
Help me now I'm on runnin' on empty  
And I don't wanna be a memory  
Kane Brown：  
Am I the only one that's comin' unglued  
Emotions building up they start to run you  
The bottles on the shelf  
I'm 'bout to run through  
Doin' everything I wish that I can undo ayy  
I'm by myself  
And I want no one help  
I know this can't be healthy  
So I'm lookin' for a way out for a way out  
All：  
I wanna live life fast  
I don't know how to slow down  
I wanna get high  
I don't know how to come down  
Help me now I'm on runnin' on empty  
And I don't wanna be a memory  
Live life fast  
I don't know how to slow down  
I wanna get high  
I don't know how to come down  
Help me now I'm on runnin' on empty  
And I don't wanna be a memory  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh-ooh  
Ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh  
And I don't wanna be a memory  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh-ooh  
Ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh  
Talk to me blackbear  
blackbear：  
Tryna find the beauty in the letdown  
Goin' through my text now  
Tryna find the things I never said to prove a point  
I'ma roll my feelings in a joint  
Pieces of the story that got left out  
I checked out  
Wish it was I wish it was I wish it was a faze  
Nothin' you could do  
And there's nothin' you could say  
Runnin' from the runnin' from the  
Runnin' from the pain  
I get away ayy-ayy I get away ayy-ayy  
I get away ayy-ayy I get away ayy-ayy  
All：  
I wanna live life fast  
I don't know how to slow down  
I wanna get high  
I don't know how to come down  
Help me now I'm on runnin' on empty  
And I don't wanna be a memory  
Live life fast  
I don't know how to slow down  
I wanna get high  
I don't know how to come down  
Help me now I'm on runnin' on empty  
And I don't wanna be a memory  
Am I the only one that's comin' unglued  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh-ooh  
Ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh  
And I don't wanna be a memory  
The bottles on the shelf I'm 'bout to run through  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh-ooh  
Ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh  
And I don't wanna be a memory  
I'm by myself  
And I want no one help  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh-ooh  
Ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh  
And I don't wanna be a memory  
I know this can't be healthy  
So I'm lookin' for a way out for a way out  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh-ooh  
Ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh  
And I don't wanna be a memory
