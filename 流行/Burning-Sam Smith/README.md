### Burning歌词：

I've been burning  
Yes I've been burning  
Such a burden  
This flame on my chest  
No insurance to pay for the damage  
Yeah I've been burning up since you left  
I've been smoking oh  
More than twenty a day  
Blame it on rebellion  
Don't blame it on me  
Wish I was younger  
Back to the nineteenth of May  
I had an open mind  
Swore to never change  
Funny how time goes by  
Had respect for myself  
That river ran dry  
You reached a limit  
I wasn't enough  
It's like the fire replaced all the love  
I've been burning  
Yes I've been burning  
Such a burden  
This flame on my chest  
No insurance to pay for the damage  
Yeah I've been burning up since you left  
Oh have you ever called  
I will burst straight back  
Give you my forgiveness  
And the shirt off my back  
No friends to turn to  
Yeah I messed up that  
Wish we could smoke again  
Just for a day oh  
Funny how time goes by  
Had respect for myself  
That river ran dry  
You reached a limit  
I wasn't enough  
And it's like the fire replaced all the love  
I've been burning  
Yes I've been burning  
Such a burden  
This flame on my chest  
No insurance to pay for the damage  
Yeah I've been burning up since you left  
Yeah I've been burning up since you left  
Oh I've been burning up since you left
