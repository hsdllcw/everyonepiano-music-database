### Hallelujah歌词：

Now I've heard there was a secret chord  
That David played and it pleased the Lord  
But you don't really care for music do ya  
It goes like this the fourth the fifth  
The minor fall the major lift  
The baffled king composing "Hallelujah"  
Hallelujah Hallelujah  
Hallelujah Hallelujah  
Your faith was strong but you needed proof  
You saw her bathing on the roof  
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you  
She tied you to a kitchen chair  
She broke your throne and she cut your hair  
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah  
Hallelujah Hallelujah  
Hallelujah Hallelujah  
Now maybe there's a God above  
As for me all I ever learned from love  
Is how to shoot at someone  
Who outdrew you  
But it's not a crime but you hear tonight  
And it's not some pilgrim who claims to have seen the light  
No it's cold and it's a very broken Hallelujah  
Hallelujah Hallelujah  
Hallelujah Hallelujah  
Hallelujah Hallelujah  
Hallelujah Hallelujah  
Oh people I've been here before  
I know this room I've walked this floor  
You see I used to live alone before I knew you  
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch  
But listen Love is not some kind of victory march  
No it's a cold and it's a very lonely Hallelujah  
Hallelujah Hallelujah  
Hallelujah Hallelujah  
There was a time you let me know  
What's really going on below  
But now now you never even show it to me do you  
I remember when I moved in you  
And the holy dove was moving too  
And every single breath that we drew was Hallelujah  
Hallelujah Hallelujah  
Hallelujah Hallelujah  
I've done my best I konw it wasn't much  
I couldn't feel so I learned to touch  
I've told the truth I didn't come here to London  
Just to fool you  
And even though it all went wrong  
I'll stand right here before the lord of song  
With nothing nothing on my tongue  
But hallelujah  
Hallelujah Hallelujah  
Hallelujah Hallelujah  
Hallelujah Hallelujah  
Hallelujah Hallelujah
