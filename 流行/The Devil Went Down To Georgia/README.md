### The Devil Went Down To Georgia歌词：

He was lookin' for a soul to steal  
He was in a bind 'Cause he was way behind  
And he was willin' to make a deal  
When he came upon this young man  
Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot  
And the devil jumped Up on a hickory  
Stump And said boy let me tell you what  
I guess you didn't know it  
But I'm a fiddle player too  
And if you care to take a dare  
I'll make a bet with you  
Now you play a pretty good fiddle  
Boy But give the devil his due  
I'll bet a fiddle of gold Against  
Your soul 'Cause I think I'm better than you  
The boy said my name's Johnny  
And it might be a sin  
But I'll take your bet And you're  
Gonna regret 'Cause I'm the best there's ever been  
Johnny rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard  
Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia  
And the devil deals the cards  
And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold  
But if you lose the devil gets your soul  
The devil opened up his case And he said  
I'll start this show  
And fire flew from his fingertips As  
He rosined up his bow  
Then he pulled the bow across the  
Strings And it made a  
And a band of demons joined in  
And it sounded something like this  
When the devil finished Johnny  
Said well you're pretty good old son  
Just sit right in that chair right there  
And let me show you how it's done  
Fire on the Mountain Run boys run  
The devil's in the House of the Rising Sun  
Chicken in a bread pan picken' out dough  
Granny does your dog bite No child no  
The devil bowed his head Because  
He knew that he'd been beat  
And he laid that golden fiddle  
On the ground at Johnny's feet  
Johnny said Devil just come on back  
If you againever wanna try  
I done told you once you son of a  
B**ch I'm the best there's ever been And he played  
Fire on the Mountain Run boys run  
The devil's in the House of the Rising Sun  
Chicken in a bread pan picken' out dough  
Granny does your dog bite No child no
