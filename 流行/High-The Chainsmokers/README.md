时隔四年，电子组合The Chainsmokers重磅回归，第四张录音室专辑首支单曲《 **HIGH** 》于2022年1月28日发行！

这首歌曲没有与其他歌手合作，而是由组合成员 Drew Taggart（猪大哥）本人亲自演唱。不过，作为曾经出过千万单曲的大爆组合，本次的新作《 _High_
》受欢迎度一般般。仅仅发行两天，该单曲就在 Spotify 平台上退热了，仅仅排名日播放量第41位。

同时，网站还为大家提供了《[ **Something Just Like This**](Music-7553-Something-Just-Like-

### High歌词：

Whoa, whoa  
So far, so good  
Mhmm, mhm, mhm, yep  
Why? You'll only say you love me when you're high  
It's like we go through the same shit every night  
Oh why, oh why?  
You always swear that it's gonna change, but it never does  
Why? You'll only say you love me when you're high  
It's like we go through the same shit every night  
Oh why, oh why?  
You always swear that shit's gonna change, but it never does  
Tell me that you're gonna change then act like this instead  
I'm too old to want somebody who's always switching up their friends  
I can't make you love me but at least you could pretend  
Scrips gonna lead to fifths until I'm fucked out of my head  
You play the same old songs  
I know that you're different in your Air Force Ones  
Filling my prescription, I could bite your tongue  
Like I got an addiction, yeah  
You always say this shit's gonna change, but it never does  
Why? You'll only say you love me when you're high  
It's like we go through the same shit every night  
Oh why, oh why?  
You always swear that it's gonna change, but it never does  
Why? You'll only say you love me when you're high  
It's like we go through the same shit every night  
Oh why, oh why?  
You always swear that shit's gonna change, but it never does  
I know it's my fault, I pick up your phone calls  
When it's half past one and you're halfway drunk  
You say you love me and it sounds so dumb  
But truly you're the only one I can't run away from  
The same old songs  
I know that you're different in your Air Force Ones  
Filling my prescription I could bite your tongue  
Like I got an addiction, yeah  
You always say this shit's gonna change, but it never does  
Why? You'll only say you love me when you're high  
It's like we go through the same shit every night  
Oh why, oh why?  
You always swear that it's gonna change, but it never does  
Why? You'll only say you love me when you're high  
It's like we go through the same shit every night  
Oh why, oh why?  
You always swear that shit's gonna change, but it never does  
You always swear that shit's gonna change, but it never does
