### Rest Your Love歌词：

I see you move so I do understand  
Why you get attention  
I hear you talk but I don't comprehend  
Why I get no mention  
Ain't you know you know where to find me  
Yeah you know where to go when you're looking for love  
Ain't you know you know where I'm hiding  
Yeah you know yeah you know  
When the stars go out  
You can rest your love on me  
And when the world gets loud  
Baby you can rest your love on me  
When the stars go out  
You can rest your love on me  
Yeah you can rest your love on me  
And when the world gets loud  
Baby you can rest your love on me  
Yeah you can rest your love on me on me  
I used to try to get into your space  
Then I learnt my lesson  
I saw the time been love with the chess  
You need some rejection  
Ain't you know you know where to find me  
Yeah you know where to go when you're looking for love  
Ain't you know you know where I'm hiding  
Yeah you know yeah you know  
When the stars go out  
You can rest your love on me  
And when the world gets loud  
Baby you can rest your love on me  
When the stars go out  
You can rest your love on me  
Yeah you can rest your love on me  
And when the world gets loud  
Baby you can rest your love on me  
Yeah you can rest your love on me  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Yeah you can rest your love on me  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Yeah you can rest your love on me on me  
Ain't you know you know where to find me  
Yeah you know where to go when you're looking for love  
Ain't you know you know where I'm hiding  
Yeah you know Ain't you know  
And when the stars go out  
You can rest your love on me  
When the stars go out you can rest your love on me  
Yeah you can rest your love on me  
And when the world gets loud  
Baby you can rest your love on me  
Yeah you can rest your love on me  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
