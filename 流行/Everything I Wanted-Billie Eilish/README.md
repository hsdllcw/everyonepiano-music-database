**Everything I Wanted双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Everything I Wanted_ 是美国女歌手Billie Eilish演唱的歌曲。

初听Billie时，觉得她像一个笑容带点狡黠与不屑的怪奇女巫。她那冷漠、另类，甚至暗黑的风格本与主流相背离，却意外地拥有了怪异的美感，像一条神秘的夜路，危险，却让人欲罢不能地想要前往。但在这首歌曲里，波浪般起伏的电子音效编织出一场寂寞的梦，带着悲伤的力量，将我卷入了大海般郁蓝的情绪里，让我共情她的难过。我觉得自己就像深海里长着古怪斑纹的鱼，咸涩的海水充满了眼眶使眼泪找不到出口，只能任由庞大的空虚感像猛兽一样将我扯碎。
Billie脆弱、无助、迷茫的声音如同一束在风中颤动的烛焰，忽明忽暗，似乎随时都会熄灭。她湮没于不为人知的深渊中，连同歌声里那些难以揣测的情绪，逐渐消逝于暗里。

### Everything I Wanted歌词：

I had a dream  
I got everything I wanted  
Not what you'd think  
And if I'm bein' honest it might've been a nightmare  
To anyone who might care  
Thought I could fly  
Fly  
So I stepped off the Golden mm  
Nobody cried  
Nobody even noticed  
I saw them standing right there  
Kinda thought they might care  
I had a dream I got everything I wanted  
But when I wake up I see you with me  
And you say "As long as I'm here no one can hurt you"  
Don't wanna lie here but you can learn to  
If I could change the way that you see yourself  
You wouldn't wonder why you hear "They don't deserve you"  
I tried to scream but my head was underwater  
They called me weak like I'm not just somebody's daughter  
Coulda been a nightmare but it felt like they were right there  
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago  
But I don't wanna let anybody know  
'Cause everybody wants something from me now  
And I don't wanna let them down  
I had a dream I got everything I wanted  
But when I wake up I see you with me  
And you say "As long as I'm here no one can hurt you"  
Don't wanna lie here but you can learn to  
If I could change the way that you see yourself  
You wouldn't wonder why you hear "They don't deserve you"  
If I knew it all then would I do it again  
Would I do it again  
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head  
What would they say instead  
If I knew it all then would I do it again  
Would I do it again  
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head  
What would they say instead
