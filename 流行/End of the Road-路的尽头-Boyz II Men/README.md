End of the Road歌词：

  
Girl you know we belong together  
I have no time for you to be playing  
With my heart like this  
You'll be mine forever baby, you just see  
We belong together  
And you know that I'm right  
Why do you play with my heart?  
Why do you play with my mind?  
Said we'd be forever, said it'd never die  
How could you love me and leave me  
And never say good-bye?  
When I can't sleep at night without holding you tight  
Girl, each time I try I just break down and cry  
Pain in my head oh I'd rather be dead  
Spinning around and around  
Although we've come to the end of the road  
Still I can't let go  
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you  
Come to the end of the road  
Still I can't let go  
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you  
Girl, I know you really love me  
You just don't realize  
You've never been there before  
It's only your first time  
Maybe I'll forgive you  
Maybe you'll try  
We should be happy together  
Forever, you and I  
Can you love me again like you loved me before?  
This time I want you to love me much more  
This time instead just come to my bed  
And baby just don't let me, don't let me down  
Although we've come to the end of the road  
Still I can't let you go  
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you  
Come to the end of the road  
Still I can't let you go  
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you  
Girl I'm here for you  
All those times of night when you just hurt me  
And just run out with that other fella  
Baby I knew about it, I just didn't care  
You just don't understand how much I love you do you?  
I'm here for you  
I'm not out to go out and cheat on you all night  
Just like you did baby but that's all right  
Hey, I love you anyway  
And I'm still gonna be here for you 'till my dying day baby  
Right now, I'm just in so much pain baby  
'Coz you just won't come back to me  
Will you? Just come back to me  
Lonely  
Lonely  
Lonely  
This time instead just come to my bed  
And baby just don't let me go  
Although we've come to the end of the road  
Still I can't let you go  
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you  
Come to the end of the road  
Still I can't let you go  
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you  
Although we've come to the end of the road  
Still I can't let you go  
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you  
Come to the end of the road  
Still I can't let you go  
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you
