### Wild Ones歌词：

[Sia - Hook]  
Hey I heard you were a wild one  
Oooh  
If I took you home  
It'd be a home run  
Show me how you do

I wanna shut down in the club  
With you  
Hey I heard you like the wild ones (wild ones wild ones)  
Oooh

[Flo Rida]  
I like crazy, foolish, stupid  
Party going wild, fist pumping music,  
I might lose it  
Glass to the roof, that how we do'z it (do'z it do'z it)  
I don't care the night, she don't care we like  
Almost dared the right vibe  
Ready to get live, ain't no surprise  
Take me so high, jumping nose dive  
Surfing the crowd  
Oooh  
Said I gotta be the man  
I'm the head of my band, mic check one two  
Shut them down in the club while the playboy does it, and y'all get loose
loose  
After bottle, we all get bent and again tomorrow  
Gotta break rules cause that's the motto  
Club shuts down, a hundred super models

[Sia - Hook]  
Hey I heard you were a wild one  
Oooh  
If I took you home  
It'd be a home run  
Show me how you do

I wanna shut down in the club  
With you  
Hey I heard you like the wild ones (wild ones wild ones)  
Oooh

[Flo Rida]  
Party rocker, foot-show stopper  
More Chambord  
Number one, club popper  
Got a hangover like too much vodka  
Can't see me with ten binoculars  
So cool  
No doubt by the end of the night  
Got the clothes coming off  
Then I make that move  
Somehow, someway, gotta raise the roof, roof  
All black shades when the sun come through  
Uh-Oh, it's on like everything goes  
Round up baby tilt the freaky show

What happens to that body, it's a private show  
Stays right here, private show  
I like 'em untamed, don't tell me how pain  
Tolerance, bottoms up with the champagne  
My life, call my homie then we hit Spain  
Do you busy with the bail, we get insane

[Sia - Hook]  
Hey I heard you were a wild one  
Oooh  
If I took you home  
It'd be a home run  
Show me how you do

I wanna shut down in the club  
With you  
Hey I heard you like the wild ones (wild ones wild ones)  
Oooh

[Bridge]  
I am a wild one  
Break me in  
Saddle me up and let's begin  
I am a wild one  
Tame me now  
Running with wolves  
And I'm on the prowl

Show you another side of me  
A side you would never thought you would see  
Tear up that body  
Dominate you 'til you've had enough  
I hear you like  
The wild stuff

[Sia - Hook]  
Hey I heard you were a wild one  
Oooh  
If I took you home  
It'd be a home run  
Show me how you'll do

I wanna shut down in the club  
With you  
Hey I heard you like the wild ones (wild ones wild ones)  
Oooh

I am a wild one  
Break me in  
Saddle me up and let's begin  
I am a wild one  
Tame me now  
Running with wolves  
And I'm on the prowl....
