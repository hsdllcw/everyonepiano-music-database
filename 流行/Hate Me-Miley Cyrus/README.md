**Hate Me** 是由Miley Cyrus录唱的一首歌曲，被收录在于2020年11月27日发行的专辑《Plastic Hearts》。

这首歌似乎是对Miley一直以来受到媒体负面关注的回应，如果她死了，围绕在她身边的媒体和媒体会突然变得积极起来。她在飞往格拉斯顿伯里音乐节的过程中濒临死亡的经历可能是触发她写下死亡的原因，因为她在舞台上表示，音乐节在很多方面都改变了她。

### Hate Me歌词：

Go ahead you can say it's my fault  
If it still hurts at all  
I thought one of these days you might call  
When you were feelin' small  
Drownin' in my thoughts  
Starin' at the clock  
And I know I'm not on your mind  
I wonder what would happen if I die  
I hope all of my friends get drunk and high  
Would it be too hard to say goodbye  
I hope that it's enough to make you cry  
Maybe that day you won't hate me  
Go ahead you can say that I've changed  
Just say it to my face  
One drink and I'm back to that place  
To that place  
The memories won't fade  
Won't fade  
Drownin' in my thoughts  
My thoughts  
Starin' at the clock  
The clock  
And I know I'm not on your mind  
I wonder what would happen if I die  
I hope all of my friends get drunk and high  
Would it be too hard to say goodbye  
I hope that it's enough to make you cry  
Maybe that day you won't hate me  
I wonder what would happen if I die  
If I die  
I hope all of my friends get drunk and high  
Would it be too hard to say goodbye  
Say goodbye  
I hope that it's enough to make you cry  
And maybe that day you won't hate me
