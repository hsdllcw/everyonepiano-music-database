**What's the Difference双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_What's the Difference_ 是美国说唱歌手、音乐制作人Dr.
Dre演唱的歌曲。作为一名制作人，Dr.Dre的革新之处在于，他使嘻哈音乐变得成熟，并且与此同时，通过发行他那些里程碑式的专辑，将这一过程中的每一次重要变革都明确的表现了出来。在乐坛打拼几十年的Dr.Dre并未仅仅止步于说唱领域，他亦是亿万身家的企业大佬，这种角色转变导致其作品不同往昔，它们听起来再也不会像他先前作为一名街头混混时创作的那般生动鲜活了。

### What's the Difference歌词：

What's the difference between me and you  
What's the difference between me and you  
Back when Cube was rollin' with Lorenzo in a Benzo  
I was bangin' with a gang of instrumentals  
Got the pens and pencils got down to business  
But sometimes the business end of this sh*t  
Can turn your friends against you  
But you was a real n**ga I could sense it in you  
I still remember the window of the car that you went through  
That's f**ked up but I'll never forget the sh*t we been through  
And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you  
'Cause you my n**ga Doc and Eazy I'm still with you  
F**k the beef n**ga I miss you  
And that's just being real with you  
You see the truth is everybody wanna know  
How close me and Snoop is and who I'm still cool with  
Then I got these fake-a** n**gas I first blew with  
Claimin' that they non-violent talkin' like they  
Spit venom in interviews speakin' on reunions  
Move units then talk sh*t and we can do this  
Until then I ain't even speakin' your name  
Just keep my name outta yo' mouth  
And we can keep it the same n**ga  
It ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors  
It's just that I'm too d**n big to pay attention to 'em  
That's the difference  
What's the difference between me and you  
You talk a good one  
But you don't do what you supposed to do  
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions  
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'  
What's the difference between me and you  
You talk a good one  
But you don't do what you supposed to do  
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions  
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'  
Yo I stay with it while you try to perpetrate and play with it  
Never knew about the next level until Dre did it  
I stay committed while you motherf**kers babysitted  
I smash you critics like a overhand right from Riddick  
Come and get it sh*tted on villains by the millions  
I be catchin' b**ches while b**ches be catchin' feelings  
So what the f**k am I supposed to do  
I pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you  
A heartless bastard high and plastered  
My style is like the reaction from too much acid  
Never come down pass it around if you can't handle it  
Hang Hollywood n**gas by they Soul Train laminates  
What's the difference between me and you  
About five bank accounts three ounces and two vehicles  
Until my death I'm Bangladesh  
I suggest you hold yo' breath 'til ain't none left  
Yo that's the difference  
What's the difference between me and you  
You talk a good one  
But you don't do what you supposed to do  
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions  
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'  
What's the difference between me and you  
You talk a good one  
But you don't do what you supposed to do  
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions  
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'  
Aight hold up hold up  
Stop the beat a minute  
I got somethin' to say Dre I wanna tell you this sh*t  
Right now while this f**kin' w**d is in me  
What the f**k  
I don't know if I ever told you this but I love you dawg  
I got your motherf**kin' back  
Right just know this sh*t  
Slim I don't know if you noticed it  
But I've had your back from day one n**ga let's blow this b**ch  
I mean it dawg you ever need somebody offed  
Whose throat is it  
Well if you ever kill that Kim b**ch  
I'll show you where the ocean is  
Well that's cool and I appreciate the offer  
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma  
I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her  
And cruise around with her for seven hours through California  
And have her wavin' at people hi  
Then drop her off on the corner  
At the police station and drive off honkin' the horn for her  
Raw dawg get your arm gnawed off drop the sawed off  
And beat you with the piece it was sawed off of  
F**k blood I wanna see some lungs coughed up  
Get shot up in the hot tub 'til the bubbles pop up  
In they nose and cough snot up mucus in hot water  
That's for tryin' to talk like The Chronic was lost product  
That's for even thinkin' of havin' them thoughts thought up  
You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up  
So what's the difference between us  
We can start at the penis or we can scream  
I just don't give a f**k and see who means it  
What's the difference between me and you  
You talk a good one  
But you don't do what you supposed to do  
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions  
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'  
What's the difference between me and you  
You talk a good one  
But you don't do what you supposed to do  
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions  
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'  
What's the difference between me and you
