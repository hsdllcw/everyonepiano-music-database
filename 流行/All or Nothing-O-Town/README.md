**All or Nothing** 是美国乐队O-Town的歌曲。这首单曲成为他们组合生涯里最著名最经典的单曲。并获得Billboard Hot
100榜单的第3名、提名奖项无数，包括2001年音乐颁奖礼的“年度最佳歌曲”。

_All or Nothing_ 的成功让五个大男孩想要更进一步到达新的领域：创作拥有自我特色的音乐。并让O-Town的定义不再仅仅是“男孩团体”。

O-Town解散后，日本组合w-inds翻唱了O-Town的《All or Nothing》，保留旋律的同时，改写了歌词。改编后的歌曲名叫《风诗-
KAZAUTA》。2006年，爱尔兰组合Westlife也在专辑《The Love Album》中翻唱了《All or
Nothing》。美国朋克乐队Fake ID也在专辑《 Punk Goes Pop》中翻唱了《All or Nothing》。

### All or Nothing歌词：

I know when he's been on your mind  
That distant look is in your eyes  
I thought with time you'd realize it's over, over  
It's not the way I choose to live  
And something somewhere's gotta give  
As sharing in this relationship gets older, older

You know I'd fight for you but how could I fight someone who isn't even there  
I've had the rest of you now I want the best of you I don't care if that's not
fair

Cuz I want it all  
Or nothing at all  
There's nowhere left to fall  
When you reach the bottom it's now or never  
Is it all  
Or are we just friends  
Is this how it ends  
With a simple telephone call  
You leave me here with nothing at all

There are time it seems to me  
I'm sharing you with memories  
I feel it in my heart but I don't show it , show it  
Then there's times you look at me  
As though I'm all that you could see  
Those times I don't believe it's right I know it , know it

Don't make me promises baby you never did know how to keep them well  
I had the rest of you now I want the best of you it's time to show and tell

Cuz I want it all  
Or nothing at all  
There's nowhere left to fall  
When you reach the bottom it's now or never  
Is it all  
Or are we just friends  
Is this how it ends  
With a simple telephone call  
You leave me here with nothing at all

Cuz you and I  
Could lose it all if you've got no more room  
No more inside for me in your life

Cuz I want it all  
Or Nothing at all  
There's nowhere left to fall  
It's now or never

Is it all  
Or Nothing at all  
When you reach the bottom it's now or never  
Is it all  
Or are we just friends  
Is this how it ends  
With a simple telephone call  
You leave me here with nothing at all  
There's nowhere left to fall
