### You're Gonna Go Far, Kid歌词：

Show me how to lie  
You’re getting better all the time  
And turning all against the one  
Is an art that’s hard to teach  
Another clever word  
Sets off an unsuspecting herd  
And as you step back into line  
A mob jumps to their feet

Now dance, fucker, dance  
Man, he never had a chance  
And no one even knew  
It was really only you

And now you steal away  
Take him out today  
Nice work you did  
You’re gonna go far, kid

With a thousand lies  
And a good disguise  
Hit ‘em right between the eyes  
Hit ‘em right between the eyes  
When you walk away  
Nothing more to say  
See the lightning in your eyes  
See ‘em running for their lives

Slowly out of line  
And drifting closer in your sights  
So play it out I’m wide awake  
It’s a scene about me  
There’s something in your way  
And now someone is gonna pay  
And if you can’t get what you want  
Well it’s all because of me

Now dance, fucker, dance  
Man, I never had a chance  
And no one even knew  
It was really only you

And now you’ll lead the way  
Show the light of day  
Nice work you did  
You’re gonna go far, kid  
Trust, deceived!

With a thousand lies  
And a good disguise  
Hit ‘em right between the eyes  
Hit ‘em right between the eyes  
When you walk away  
Nothing more to say  
See the lightning in your eyes  
See ‘em running for their lives

Now dance, fucker, dance  
He never had a chance  
And no one even knew  
It was really only you

So dance, fucker, dance  
I never had a chance  
It was really only you

With a thousand lies  
And a good disguise  
Hit ‘em right between the eyes  
Hit ‘em right between the eyes  
When you walk away  
Nothing more to say  
See the lightning in your eyes  
See ‘em running for their lives

Clever alibis  
Lord of the flies  
Hit ‘em right between the eyes  
Hit ‘em right between the eyes  
When you walk away  
Nothing more to say  
See the lightning in your eyes  
See ‘em running for their lives
