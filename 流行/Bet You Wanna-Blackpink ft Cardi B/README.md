### Bet You Wanna歌词：

BLACKPINK  
Cardi  
Tell me where you wanna go  
I'll meet you with my bags at the door  
Ah I'm gon' make you go blind  
Every time I walk my hips they don't lie  
Take me to your paradise  
'Cause I don't wanna wait anymore  
Ah I'll say it one more time  
Every time I walk my hips they don't lie  
You wanna touch wanna touch  
Of course you wanna  
You wanna run with my love  
I know you wanna  
From the club to the tub  
You said you wanna  
Give me an all night hug I bet you wanna  
I bet you wanna  
I bet you wanna  
I bet you  
I bet you  
I bet you wanna I bet you wanna I bet you wanna  
Something bout me's takin you higher  
And you ain't ever gonna come down  
You ain't ever you ain't ever  
I'm lighting your fire  
And it ain't ever gonna go out  
It ain't ever it ain't ever  
Take the car keys  
Drive me crazy  
Cardi a good catch  
But you gotta chase me  
Grab my waist line but don't ever waste me  
Turn on please me but don't ever play me  
One of a kind  
You can't replace me  
Time to shine I bust down the AP  
The stakes is higher  
Let's do what we both desire  
On god like I'm in the choir  
I bet you if you make me sweat I'll still be on fire  
You wanna touch wanna touch  
Of course you wanna  
You wanna run with my love  
I know you wanna  
From the club to the tub  
You said you wanna  
Give me an all night hug I bet you wanna  
I bet you wanna  
I bet you wanna  
I bet you  
I bet you  
I bet you wanna I bet you wanna I bet you wanna  
Something bout me's takin you higher  
And you ain't ever gonna come down  
You ain't ever you ain't ever  
I'm lighting your fire  
And it ain't never gonna go out  
It ain't ever it ain't ever  
If you want me  
Better bet higher  
Wanna look down  
Up in the sky ahh  
Higher higher higher higher high  
Boy better take it up so d**n high  
Lookin so thick  
Make you desire  
I'm a whole bit  
Keep you up higher  
Higher higher higher higher high  
Something bout me's taking you higher  
And you ain't ever gonna come down  
You ain't ever you ain't ever  
I'm lighting your fire  
And it ain't ever gonna go out  
It ain't ever it ain't ever  
Something bout me's taking you higher  
And you ain't ever gonna come down  
You ain't ever you ain't ever  
Bet you wanna love this ahhh
