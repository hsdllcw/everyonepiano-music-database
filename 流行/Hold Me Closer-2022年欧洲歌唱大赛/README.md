### Hold Me Closer歌词：

No need to apologize  
'Cause there's nothing to regret  
Well this is not what I wanted  
Guess all the good things come to an end  
So baby bye bye  
Wish you the best  
But most of all I wish that I could love you less  
Well maybe you're right I'll find someone else  
You say it isn't me but when did that ever help  
Hold me closer  
Although you'll leave before the sunrise  
Might be bleeding but don't you mind I'll be fine  
Oh it kills me  
I found the right one at the wrong time  
But until the sunrise  
Hold tight hold tight  
Maybe it happened too fast  
I guess that I understand  
You say that you never felt this way for anyone  
And that's why it scares you to death  
So baby bye bye  
Know it's for the best  
Still I can't see how that  
Would ease the pain in my chest  
Hold me closer  
Although you'll leave before the sunrise  
I'll be bleeding but don't you mind I'll be fine  
Oh it kills me  
I found the right one at the wrong time  
But until the sunrise  
Could you just hold me tight  
I know I have to let go  
But just give me the night  
Oooooh  
'Cause tomorrow will hurt  
Hurt really bad  
'Cause I'm about to lose the best I ever had  
Hold me closer  
Although you'll leave before the sunrise  
I'll be bleeding but don't you mind I'll be fine  
Oh it kills me  
I found the right one at the wrong time  
But until the sunrise  
Could you just hold me tight hold tight hold tight  
I know I have to let go  
But just give me the night hold tight  
Can't you see that you  
Found the right one at the wrong time  
It was just the wrong time  
Hold tight hold tight
