**Ghost** 是由加拿大流行乐男歌手Justin Bieber录唱的一首歌曲，被收录在他的录音室专辑《Justice》。

《 _Ghost_
》的歌词有点伤感；但在曲调方面，浩室与吉他的对接营造出绝对的乐观态度。Bieber的说法是，这首歌关于“失去所爱之人。我知道很多人都经历过；今年尤其艰巨，我们失去了很多亲人和关系。歌词的钩子是，如果我无法靠近你，和你的灵魂作伴也可以。隔离期间就是这样……我们无法像从前那样沟通联系，真的只剩下这些回忆。我希望歌曲能够引起共鸣，同时或多或少为大家带来喜悦或安慰。”

### Ghost歌词：

Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow  
I miss your touch on nights when I'm hollow  
I know you crossed a bridge that I can't follow  
Since the love that you left is all that I get  
I want you to know that  
If I can't be close to you  
I'll settle for the ghost of you  
I miss you more than life  
More than life  
And if you can't be next to me  
Your memory is ecstasy  
I miss you more than life  
I miss you more than life  
Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow  
Woo  
I need more time but time can't be borrowed  
I leave it all behind if I could follow  
Since the love that you left is all that I get  
I want you to know that  
If I can't be close to you  
I'll settle for the ghost of you  
I miss you more than life yeah  
And if you can't be next to me  
Your memory is ecstasy  
I miss you more than life  
I miss you more than life  
Whoa oh oh-oh  
More than life  
Oh-oh  
So if I can't get close to you  
I settle for the ghost of you  
I miss you more than life  
And if you can't be next to me  
Your memory is ecstasy  
I miss you more than life  
I miss you more than life
