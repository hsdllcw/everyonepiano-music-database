**Stupid Love双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Stupid Love_ 是美国流行天后Lady
Gaga个人第六张录音室专辑《Chromatica》的首支单曲。这也是Gaga向流行的一次盛大回归，闪耀的迪斯科律动仿佛在向The Fame
Monster时期的自己致敬，细听又给人一种Do What U Want变速版的错觉。

MV画面设计颇有90年代日式JPRG游戏的风格，带来不一样的视觉体验。这首活力动感的舞曲以纯粹的感官刺激带给听众“愚蠢的”快乐体验，也填补了现今数字时代人们沮丧敏感的内心世界，充分体现了Gaga崇尚感性诉求本能的音乐哲学。作为顶级pop巨星，Lady
Gaga一直在用她最独特的方式为我们带来别样的惊喜。

### Stupid Love歌词：

You're the one that I've been waiting for  
Gotta quit this cryin'  
Nobody's gonna heal me if I don't open the door  
Kinda hard to believe  
Gotta have faith in me  
I freak out I freak out  
I freak out I freak out  
Look at me  
I get down I get down  
I get down I get down  
Look at me  
I freak out I freak out  
I freak out I freak out  
Look at me now  
'Cause all I ever wanted was love  
Hey yeah yeah yeah  
Ooo  
Hey yeah yeah yeah  
Ooo  
Hey yeah yeah yeah  
All I ever wanted was love  
Hey yeah yeah yeah  
Ooo  
Hey yeah yeah yeah  
Ooo  
Hey yeah yeah  
Hey yeah yeah yeah  
Higher higher  
I want your stupid love love  
I want your stupid love love  
Ooo oo oo uh uh uh uh oh  
Uh uh oo oo oo oh oh oh oh  
Now it's time to free me from the chain  
I gotta find that peace  
Is it too late or  
Could this love protect me from the pain  
I would battle for you  
Even if I break in two  
I freak out I freak out  
I freak out I freak out  
Look at me  
I get down I get down  
I get down I get down  
Look at me  
I freak out I freak out  
I freak out I freak out  
Look at me now  
'Cause all I ever wanted was love  
Hey yeah yeah yeah  
Ooo  
Hey yeah yeah yeah  
Ooo  
Hey yeah yeah yeah  
All I ever wanted was love  
Hey yeah yeah yeah  
Ooo  
Hey yeah yeah yeah  
Ooo  
Hey yeah yeah  
Hey yeah yeah yeah  
Higher higher  
I want your stupid love love  
I want your stupid love love  
Ooo oo oo uh uh uh uh oh  
Uh uh oo oo oo oh oh oh oh  
I don't need a reason  
Oh  
Not sorry I want your stupid love  
I don't need a reason
