### Forever歌词：

Could you be here with me forever ever ever  
Would you be here with me forever ever ever  
Wakin' up all alone ain't better better better  
Every time I go the wrong way you turn me back around  
Turn me back like woah-woah woah-woah oh-oh-oh  
Woah woah-woah forever ever ever ever  
Do you wanna look at me forever ever ever  
Yeah do you see us in Vegas pushin' that Monte Carlo  
Bet that money on baby bet she don't leave me oh no  
See them he wears in the desert look like a lake in the sand  
Would you watch the sun burn out with me forever ever ever ever  
You still intimidate me keep me up on my toes now  
Better man what you made me made me aware of what I was missin'  
Been missin' the way you give me envision babe  
Never thought I'd settle down I cannot lie to myself  
I was busy focusin' on bein' by myself  
Set my feelings to the side they all got dusty on the shelf  
You wiped them down when I had nothin' left  
Could you be here with me forever ever ever  
Would you be here with me forever ever ever  
Wakin' up all alone ain't better better better  
Every time I go the wrong way you turn me back around  
Turn me back like woah-woah woah-woah oh-oh-oh  
Woah woah-woah forever ever ever ever  
Do you wanna look at me forever ever ever  
When you asked me if I cheated I said never  
No way  
What are you willing to do to stay together  
'Gether  
How many times we gonna break up 'fore the summer  
How many times you gonna try to call my mother  
Brrr-brrr  
Girl you're killin' me I don't wanna act like I can fix this  
Fix it fix it  
I don't wanna be the one that's changed since Texas  
Currency it comes so naturally but I can't buy your love  
Could you be here with me forever ever ever  
Would you be here with me forever ever ever  
Wakin' up all alone ain't better better better  
Every time I go the wrong way you turn me back around  
Turn me back like woah-woah woah-woah oh-oh-oh  
Woah woah-woah forever ever ever ever  
Do you wanna look at me forever ever ever  
I promise I'm gonna love you 'til my dying day  
You wake up your face in my chest your favorite hiding place  
The roof is gone as we're driving out the private gate  
Countin' the stars with our last name on the license plate  
Woah oh oh oh  
I lied to myself 'bout trying to be here all alone  
When I leave it's bye for now it's just never bye for long  
Set my feelings aside let's settle down  
Every time I go the wrong way you turn me back around  
Turn me back like woah-woah woah-woah oh-oh-oh  
Woah woah-woah forever ever ever ever  
Do you wanna look at me forever ever ever  
Would you be here with me forever ever ever  
Would you be here with me forever ever ever  
Wakin' up all alone ain't better better better  
Every time I go the wrong way you turn me back around
