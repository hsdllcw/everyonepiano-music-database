### Sign of the Times歌词：

Just stop your crying it's a sign of the times  
Welcome to the final show  
Hope you're wearing your best clothes  
You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky  
You look pretty good down here  
But you ain't really good  
We never learn we been here before  
Why are we always stuck and running from  
The bullets  
The bullets  
We never learn we been here before  
Why are we always stuck and running from  
Your bullets  
Your bullets  
Just stop your crying it's a sign of the times  
We gotta get away from here  
We gotta get away from here  
Just stop your crying it'll be alright  
They told me that the end is near  
We gotta get away from here  
Just stop your crying have the time of your life  
Breaking through the atmosphere  
And things are pretty good from here  
Remember everything will be alright  
We can meet again somewhere  
Somewhere far away from here  
We never learn we been here before  
Why are we always stuck and running from  
The bullets  
The bullets  
We never learn we been here before  
Why are we always stuck and running from  
The bullets  
The bullets  
Just stop your crying it's a sign of the times  
We gotta get away from here  
We gotta get away from here  
Stop your crying baby it'll be alright  
They told me that the end is near  
We gotta get away from here  
We never learn we been here before  
Why are we always stuck and running from  
The bullets  
The bullets  
We never learn we've been here before  
Why are we always stuck and running from  
The bullets  
Your bullets  
We don't talk enough we should open up  
Before it's all too much  
Will we ever learn  
We've been here before  
It's just what we know  
Stop your crying baby it's a sign of the times  
We gotta get away we got to get away  
We got to get away we got to get away  
We got to get away  
We got to we got to away  
We got to we got to away  
We got to we got to away
