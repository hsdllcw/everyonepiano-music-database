**Something** 是The Beatles（披头士）最后一张专辑abbey
road中的一首歌曲，也是专辑中极为优秀的单曲之一。这首歌由乐队的主吉他手George Harrison创作并演唱，在1969年10月6日在英国发行为单曲。

  
在英国榜达到了#4，在美国榜到达了#1。

  
这首歌曲是乔治哈里森最成功的单曲之一，最终单曲获得了美国唱片协会2白金的销售认证。歌曲以哈里森的主吉它声为开始，哈里森的细腻的声线久久萦绕在耳畔，让人回味无穷，比起同时打榜的列侬的come
together，这首歌更能打动听众！

Something_ 也被认为是披头士乐队在“yesterday”后最成功的单曲，被很多的音乐家翻唱过，包括猫王、Eric Clapton和James
Brown等顶尖艺术家。

### Something歌词：

Something in the way she moves  
Attracts me like no other lover  
Something in the way she woos me  
I don't want to leave her now  
You know I believe and how  
Somewhere in her smile she knows  
That I don't need no other lover  
Something in her style that shows me  
Don't want to leave her now  
You know I believe and how  
You're asking me will my love grow  
I don't know, I don't know  
You stick around now it may show  
I don't know, I don't know  
Something in the way she knows  
And all I have to do is think of her  
Something in the things she shows me  
Don't want to leave her now  
You know I believe and how
