### Boyfriend歌词：

I want a boyfriend  
But I just keep hitting dead ends  
Try to take a short cut but I get cut again and again  
I want a boyfriend  
Tell me are there any good ones left  
I keep finding wrong ones but I want love again and again  
I want a boyfriend  
I been up all night  
Pretty restlessly  
Think I might know why  
Uh  
I've been doing just fine  
But baby that don't mean  
That I'm feeling anti you and me  
There's a difference between a want and a need  
Some nights I just want more than me  
I know that there's a fine line between  
It's not what I need but  
I want a boyfriend  
But I just keep hitting dead ends  
Try to take a short cut but I get cut again and again  
I want a boyfriend  
Tell me are there any good ones left  
I keep finding wrong ones but I want love again and again  
I want a boyfriend  
I want a boyfriend  
I could phone a friend use a hotline or something  
But that won't get the job done  
Uh uh  
'Cause every time I try  
Every time they lie  
Uh huh  
I get a little anti you and me  
There's a difference between a want and a need  
Some nights I just want more than me  
I know that there's a fine line between  
It's not what I need but  
I want a boyfriend  
But I just keep hitting dead ends  
Try to take a short cut but I get cut again and again  
I want a boyfriend  
Tell me are there any good ones left  
I keep finding wrong ones but I want love again and again  
I want a boyfriend  
I want a boyfriend  
I want a boyfriend
