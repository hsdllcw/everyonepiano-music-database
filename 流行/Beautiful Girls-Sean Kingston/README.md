**Beautiful Girls** 是歌手Sean Kingston的第2支个人单曲。Sean
Kingston，牙买加人，现住美国迈阿密。虽年仅17岁【2007年17岁】，但机智聪慧的说唱技巧和十足雷鬼味的说腔让人不得不对其产生好奇与好感。而其家庭背景也相当优秀:
雷鬼艺人Buju Banton是他的叔叔，在牙买加为Bob Marley 和Burning Spear录制专辑的Jack
Ruby则是他的祖父。此次官方发行的单曲”Beautiful Girls”由著名音乐制作人Jonathan “J.R.” Rotem监制，该曲是Sean
Kingston计划于2007年秋季发行首张个人同名专辑中的一首。Sean Kingston还和The Game 以及 Rick
Ross合作演唱歌曲”Colors”，这首歌就没有” _Beautiful Girls_ ”来的温柔啦，呵呵，美国式说唱味道很浓，不过听听也不错。Sean
Kingston保持他的态度：”做好的音乐，不需要辱骂" 。

歌词下方是 _Beautiful Girls钢琴谱_ ，希望大家喜欢。

### Beautiful Girls歌词：

JR! Sean Kingston!

[Chorus:]  
You're way too beautiful girl  
That's why it'll never work  
You'll have me suicidal, suicidal  
When you say it's over  
Damn all these beautiful girls  
They only wanna do you dirt  
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal  
When they say it's over

[Verse 1:]  
See it started at the park  
Used to chill after dark  
Oh when you took my heart  
That's when we fell apart  
Cause we both thought  
That love lasts forever (lasts forever)  
They say we're too young  
To get ourselves sprung  
Oh we didn't care  
We made it very clear  
And they also said  
That we couldn't last together (last together)

[Refrain:]  
See it's very define girl,  
One of a kind  
But you mash up my mind  
You have to get declined  
Oh Lord...  
My baby is driving me crazy

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]  
It was back in '99  
Watchin' movies all the time  
Oh when I went away  
For doin' my first crime  
And I never thought  
That we was gonna see each other (see each other)  
And then I came out  
Mami moved me down South  
Oh I'm with my girl  
Who I thought was my world  
It came out to be  
That she wasn't the girl for me (girl for me)

[Refrain and chorus]

[Verse 3:]  
Now we're fussin'  
And now we're fightin'  
Please tell me why  
I'm feelin' slighted  
And I don't know  
How to make it better (make it better)  
You're datin' other guys  
You're tellin' me lies  
Oh I can't believe  
What I'm seein' with my eyes  
I'm losin' my mind  
And I don't think it's clever (think it's clever)  
[Chorus]
