**Obvious** 是由美国女歌手Ariana
Grande录唱的一首歌曲，被收录在其于2020年10月30日发行的第六张录音室专辑《Positions》。

歌曲很甜，很上头的。整首歌的曲调从开始的静谧、和缓，到逐渐的欢快上扬，感觉好像给爱人或情人自己对感情投入的暗示后，等待对方回应的那种期待和小庆喜。亦或是跟爱人或情人在一起后自己独自回忆、回味之前自己所在感情表现和流露所悄悄使用的小手段和小暗示的那种窃喜。

### Obvious歌词：

I love the taste of you in the morning  
Keep me warm and  
Nothin' else nothin' more important  
Makes me wanna believe in love  
Mmm  
I love the thought of us in the evening  
Crave the feeling  
The way you feel somethin' 'bout a feeling  
I'm praying we don't f**k this up  
Ah-ah-ah babe  
Others that I've had had to impress me before  
But I knew you were the real thing  
When you walked through the door  
I didn't think I would have to spell it out  
Don't put the bands put the bands on me  
All my love all my love is free  
Ain't no price on my loyalty  
No s**t got me right where you want me baby  
Could I be more obvious?  
Ooh  
Hard to think when I'm under you  
Tell you all of my dirty truths  
No s**t got me right where you want me baby  
Could I be more obvious?  
Maybe if I'm lucky you might stay the afternoon  
If you gotta work just promise me you'll come back soon  
Maybe you should pack a suitcase too  
Too  
I love the thought of you never leavin'  
No  
Days are beating  
Gettin' steps up on the treadmill while you sleepin'  
Never thought I'd believe in love again  
Others that I've had had to impress me before  
But I knew you were the real thing  
When you walked through the door  
I didn't think I would have to spell it out  
Don't put the bands put the bands on me  
All my love all my love is free  
Ain't no price on my loyalty  
No s**t got me right where you want me baby  
Could I be more obvious?  
Ooh  
Hard to think when I'm under you  
Tell you all of my dirty truths  
No s**t got me right where you want me baby  
Could I be more obvious?
