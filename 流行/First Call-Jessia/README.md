### First Call歌词：

Are you there babe are you scared  
Is there anything I can promise  
To keep you here  
Break my branches grow your wings  
Try your best to carry on  
But don't you forget about me  
So when you're ready to fall in love  
Oh and you think that you've had enough  
I better be your first call  
I better be your first call  
Through the silence I'm screaming out  
I still love you more than anything else  
Hm hm hm  
You beautiful creature give me a smile  
'Cause I haven't felt that warmth from you  
In a while  
So when you're ready to fall in love  
Oh and you think that you've had enough  
I better be your first call  
I better be your first call  
I better be your first call call me crazy  
I better be your first call call me crazy  
I better be your first call
