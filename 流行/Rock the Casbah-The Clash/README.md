**Rock the Casbah** 是英国摇滚乐队The Clash所演唱的一首歌曲。

The
Clash（碰撞）乐队是前朋克时期具有开创意义的乐队，也是这一时期在商业运作上最为成功的朋克乐队。最初是一支政治反叛乐队，然后逐渐吸收雷盖尔及流行摇滚的元素、
MTV的运作。尽管后来他们逐渐偏离了朋克的路线，但他们的首张同名专辑已经成为了朋克摇滚的圣典，而1979年的专辑《London
Calling》更被众多的摇滚评论家推为有史以来最好的摇滚专辑之一。 _Rock the Casbah_ 此曲收录在1982 年乐队的专辑《Combat
Rock》中。

### Rock the Casbah歌词：

Now the king told the boogie men  
You have to let that raga drop  
The oil down the desert way  
Has been shakin' to the top  
The sheik he drove his Cadillac  
He went a' cruisnin' down the ville  
The muezzin was a' standing  
On the radiator grille

[Chorus]  
The shareef don't like it  
Rockin' the Casbah  
Rock the Casbah  
The shareef don't like it  
Rockin' the Casbah  
Rock the Casbah

By order of the prophet  
We ban that boogie sound  
Degenerate the faithful  
With that crazy Casbah sound  
But the Bedouin they brought out  
The electric camel drum  
The local guitar picker  
Got his guitar picking thumb  
As soon as the shareef  
Had cleared the square  
They began to wail

[Chorus]

Now over at the temple  
Oh! They really pack 'em in  
The in crowd say it's cool  
To dig this chanting thing  
But as the wind changed direction  
The temple band took five  
The crowd caught a wiff  
Of that crazy Casbah jive

[Chorus]

The king called up his jet fighters  
He said you better earn your pay  
Drop your bombs between the minarets  
Down the Casbah way

As soon as the shareef was  
Chauffeured outta there  
The jet pilots tuned to  
The cockpit radio blare

As soon as the shareef was  
Outta their hair  
The jet pilots wailed

[Chorus]

He thinks it's not kosher  
Fundamentally he can't take it.  
You know he really hates it.
