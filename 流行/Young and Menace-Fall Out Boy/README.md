Boy是来自芝加哥的一个乐队，组建于2001年，曾获格莱美提名。充满年轻活力朝气，畅快将庞克的不羁气焰完全释放，些许EMO风格夹带流畅声线， Fall

Stump、吉他手Joseph Trohman、贝斯手Peter Wentz及鼓手Andrew Hurley四人在2000年组织而成，夹带Metal-

Boy的歌曲朗朗上口容易消化，充满旺盛精力所演出的舞台效果，皆是令台下乐迷为之疯狂的诱因。

### Young and Menace歌词：

We've gone way too fast for way too long  
And we were never supposed to make it half this far  
And I lived so much life, lived so much life  
I think that God is gonna have to kill me twice  
Kill me twice like my name was Nikki Sixx  
I woke up in my shoes again, but somewhere you exist singing,  
Oops, I did it again,  
I forgot what I was losing my mind about  
I only wrote this down to make you press rewind  
And send a message I was young and a menace  
Woke up on the wrong side of reality  
And there's a madness that's just coursing right through me  
And as far as the time, far as the time  
Not sure I'm there yet but I'm certain I've arrived  
Oops, I did it again,  
I forgot what I was losing my mind about  
I only wrote this down to make you press rewind  
And send a message I was young and a menace  
If I am off the deep end  
I'm just here to become the best yet  
I'm just here for the psych assessment  
I'm just here for the, for the...  
Fall  
We've gone way too fast for way too long
