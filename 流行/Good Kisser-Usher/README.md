### Good Kisser歌词：

Make every minute worth it, baby  
This for Usher, baby  
Watch this

I done been around the world, I done kissed a lot of girls  
So I'm guessin' that it's true  
Make me holla and I bet a million dollars  
Don't nobody kiss it like you  
Don't nobody kiss it like you, don't nobody kiss it like you, ba-baby  
Don't nobody kiss it like you, don't nobody kiss it like you

It's 5 in the mornin'  
Kush is rollin' while she's makin' steak and eggs  
At 5 in the mornin'  
We can only be about to do one thing (what?)

See, I told her  
The devil is a lie  
Them other girls can't compete with mine  
You do it so good, you fuck my mind  
You pull it out, then you open wide  
You make me wanna tap out and retire  
Your pretty lips leave me so inspired

I think that she's a winner  
She could be a keeper

Cause she's such a good kisser  
Got lipstick on my leg  
Oh baby  
She's such a good kisser  
I'ma rain on this parade  
Oh baby

I done been around the world, I done kissed a lot of girls  
So I'm guessin' that it's true  
Make me holla and I bet a million dollars  
Don't nobody kiss it like you  
Don't nobody kiss it like you, don't nobody kiss it like you, ba-baby  
Don't nobody kiss it like you, don't nobody kiss it like you

This girl, she's my hero  
Get dinero, euros, pesos, francs and yen  
(I ain't wanna check off either)  
I'm starin' at your barrel  
Pull the trigger, chitty, chitty, bang, babe

See, I told her  
The devil is a lie  
Them other girls can't compete with mine  
You do it so good, you fuck my mind  
You pull it out, then you open wide  
You make me wanna tap out and retire  
Your pretty lips leave me so inspired

I think I got a winner  
Could be a keeper

Cause she's such a good kisser  
Got lipstick on my leg  
Oh baby  
She's such a good kisser  
I'ma rain on this parade  
Oh baby

I done been around the world, I done kissed a lot of girls  
So I'm guessin' that it's true  
Make me holla and I bet a million dollars  
Don't nobody kiss it like you  
Don't nobody kiss it like you, don't nobody kiss it like you, ba-baby  
Don't nobody kiss it like you, don't nobody kiss it like you

Listen, the only thing I know  
You give it to me, baby, with good flow  
Don't ever run it back, come on, keep goin'  
Just give it to me, give it up to me, give it up to me  
I can't keep my control  
Every time that I see you hit that floor  
Just keep on givin' it to me, I want mine  
Just come on baby, just give it to me, give it up to me

Kiss it good, kiss it right  
Keep it up, we be kissin' all night  
Kiss it good, kiss it right  
Keep it up, we be kissin' all night  
Kiss it good, kiss it right  
Keep it up, we be kissin' all night  
Kiss it good, kiss it right  
Keep it up, we be kissin' all night

Cause she's such a good kisser  
Got lipstick on my leg  
Oh baby  
She's such a good kisser  
I'ma rain on this parade  
Oh baby

I done been around the world, I done kissed a lot of girls  
So I'm guessin' that it's true  
Make me holla and I bet a million dollars  
Don't nobody kiss it like you  
Don't nobody kiss it like you, don't nobody kiss it like you, ba-baby  
Don't nobody kiss it like you, don't nobody kiss it like you

I done been around the world, I done kissed a lot of girls  
So I'm guessin' that it's true  
Make me holla and I bet a million dollars  
Don't nobody kiss it like you  
Don't nobody kiss it like you, don't nobody kiss it like you, ba-baby  
Don't nobody kiss it like you, don't nobody kiss it like you
