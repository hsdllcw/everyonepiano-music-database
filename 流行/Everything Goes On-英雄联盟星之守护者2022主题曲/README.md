### Everything Goes On歌词：

Don't try to make yourself remember darling  
Don't look for me I'm just a story you've been told  
So let's pretend a little longer  
Cause when we're gone  
Everything goes on  
Well you were staring at the window  
And I said I wanna take you to the sea  
And when I'm better we'll do everything  
I gotta stop making promises I can't keep  
But if I was gone tomorrow  
Won't the waves crash on  
Is it selfish that I'm happy  
As we pass the setting sun  
Someday I'll be overcast  
But you won't have to cry  
Cause we'll do the grieving  
While I'm by your side  
I said  
Don't try to make yourself remember darling  
Don't look for me I'm just a story you've been told  
So let's pretend a little longer  
Cause when we're gone  
Everything goes on  
And I'm so scared of getting used to this  
All the vines that keep you tethered in your room  
Well someday both of us are leaving here  
But for now I'll just bring the sea to you  
Will you meet me in the daylight  
Like we did before  
Then I felt you on my shoulder  
And you weren't suffering anymore  
Said I'm sorry that you worried  
But don't apologize  
I told you to forget me  
But you stayed by my side  
When I said  
Don't try to make yourself remember darling  
Don't look for me I'm just a story you've been told  
So let's pretend a little longer  
And when we're gone  
Everything goes on
