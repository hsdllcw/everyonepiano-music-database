### Youth歌词：

Here I am stuck on this couch scrolling through my notes  
Heart was broken still not growing nah  
Waking up to headlines filled with devastation again  
My heart is broken but I keep going  
Pain but I won't let it turn into hate  
No I won't let it change me  
Never losing sight of the one I keep inside  
Now I know it yeah I know it  
You can't take my youth away  
This soul of mine will never break  
As long as I wake up today  
You can't take my youth away  
You can't take my youth away  
This soul of mine will never break  
As long as I wake up today  
You can't take my youth away  
You can't take my youth away  
It's hard to sleep at night knowing what's outside  
Feeling hopeless I need focus  
You hit me with words I never heard come out your mouth  
To be honest I don't want it no  
Pain but I won't let it turn into hate  
No I won't let it change me  
You can't take my youth away  
Soul of mine will never break  
As long as I wake up today  
You can't take my youth away  
You can't take my youth away  
Soul of mine will never break  
As long as I wake up today  
You can't take my youth away  
You can't take my youth away can't take my youth  
You can't take my youth away  
Oh yeah  
Pain but I won't let it turn into hate  
No I won't let it change me  
Pain but I won't let it turn into hate  
No I won't let it change me  
You can't take my youth away  
Soul of mine will never break  
As long as I wake up today  
You can't take my youth away youth away  
You can't take my youth away  
Soul of mine will never break  
As long as I wake up today  
You can't take my youth away oh yeah  
You can't take my youth away  
Soul of mine will never break  
As long as I wake up today  
You can't take my youth away  
You can't take my youth away  
Soul of mine will never break  
As long as I wake up today  
You can't take my youth away  
You can't take my youth away
