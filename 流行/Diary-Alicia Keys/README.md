### Diary歌词：

[Verse 1:]  
Lay your head on my pillow  
Here you can be yourself  
No one has to know what you are feelin'  
No one but me and you

[Hook:]  
I won't tell your secrets  
Your secrets are safe with me  
I will keep your secrets (yes, I will)  
Just think of me as the pages in your diary

[Verse 2:]  
I feel such a connection  
Even when you're far away.  
Oh, baby if there is anything that you fear (anything)  
Just call my number baby, baby and I'll be here

[Hook 2:]  
I won't tell your secrets  
Your secrets are safe with me (safe with me)  
I will keep your secrets (yes, I will)  
Just think of me as the pages in your diary

Yeah, a-ha, oh.

[Bridge:]  
Only we know what is talked about, baby boy  
I don't know how you could be driving me so crazy, boy  
Baby when you're in town why don't you come around, boy?  
I'll be the loyalty you need  
You can trust me, boy, a-ha

[Hook:]  
I won't tell (no, no, no) your secrets (I won't tell nobody)  
Your secrets are safe with me (safe with me)
