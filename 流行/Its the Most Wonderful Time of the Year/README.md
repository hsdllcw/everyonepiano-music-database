### It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year歌词：

It's the most wonderful time of the year  
With the kids jingle belling  
And everyone telling you "be of good cheer"  
It's the most wonderful time of the year  
It's the hap-happiest season of all  
With those holiday greetings  
And gay happy meetings when friends come to call  
It's the hap-happiest season of all  
There'll be parties for hosting  
Marshmallows for toasting  
And caroling out in the snow  
There'll be scary ghost stories  
And tales of the glories  
Of Christmases long long ago  
It's the most wonderful time of the year  
There'll be much mistletoeing  
And hearts will be glowing when loved ones are near  
It's the most wonderful time of the year  
There'll be parties for hosting  
Marshmallows for toasting  
And caroling out in the snow  
There'll be scary ghost stories  
And tales of the glories  
Of Christmases long long ago  
It's the most wonderful time of the year  
There'll be much mistletoeing  
And hearts will be glowing when loved ones are near  
It's the most wonderful time  
Oh the most wonderful time  
Oh the most wonderful time of the year
