### Hard Times歌词：

All that I want

Is to wake up fine

Tell me that I'm alright

That I ain't gonna die

All that I want

Is a hole in the ground

You can tell me when it's alright

For me to come out

Hard times

Gonna make you wonder why you even try

Hard times

Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry

These lives

And I still don't know how I even survive

Hard times hard times

And I gotta get to rock bottom

Walking around

With my little raincloud

Hanging over my head

And it ain't coming down

Where do I go

Gimme some sort of sign

You hit me with lightning

Maybe I'll come alive

Hard times

Gonna make you wonder why you even try

Hard times

Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry

These lives

And I still don't know how I even survive

Hard times hard times

And I gotta hit rock bottom

Tell my friends I'm coming down

We'll kick it when I hit the ground

Tell my friends I'm coming down

We'll kick it when I hit the ground

When I hit the ground when I hit the ground

When I hit the ground when I hit the ground

Hard times

Gonna make you wonder why you even try

Hard times

Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry

These lives

And I still don't know how I even survive

Hard times

Hard times

Hard times

Hard times

Hard times

Gonna make you wonder why you even try

Hard times

Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry

These lives

And I still don't know how I even survive

Hard times

Hard times

Hard times

And I gotta get to rock bottom
