威尔士创作型歌手Marina第五张录音室大碟首支主打 **Man's World**
于2020年11月18日发行。“响亮”的标题已经明确这首单曲所强调主题。

作为极具女权色彩的一首歌，除了叙述女性由古至今依然遭受男性统领的社会不平等对待，也提及LGBTQ+弱小群体在这社会结构下被“迫害”。
更利用气候暖化带来毁灭性的后果作比喻双关气候问题和人类平等关系。

### Man's World歌词：

Cheeks are rosy like a Boucher cherub  
I'm a strawberry soda  
Raise my lashes to heaven  
Stars in my hair running like a waterfall  
Clouds in the whites of our eyes we saw it all  
Burnt me at the stake you thought I was a witch  
Centuries ago now you just call me a b***h  
Mother nature's dying  
Nobody's keeping score  
I don't wanna live in a man's world anymore  
I don't wanna live in a man's world anymore  
Anymore  
Marilyn's bungalow it's number seven  
In the pink palace where men made her legend  
Owned by a sheik who killed thousands of gay men  
I guess that's why he bought the Campest Hotel in LA then  
Mother nature's dying  
Nobody's keeping score  
I don't wanna live in a man's world anymore  
I don't wanna live in a man's world anymore  
If you have a mother daughter or a friend  
Maybe it is time time you comprehend  
The world that you live in  
Ain't the same one as them  
So don't punish me for not being a man  
Spring appears when the time is right  
Women are violets coming to light  
Don't underestimate the making of life  
The planet has a funny way of stopping a fight  
Mother nature's dying  
Nobody's keeping score  
I don't wanna live in a man's world anymore  
I don't wanna live in a man's world anymore  
If you have a mother daughter or a friend  
Maybe it is time time you comprehend  
The world that you live in  
Ain't the same one as them  
So don't punish me 'cause I'm not a man  
So don't punish me 'cause I'm not a man  
'Cause I'm not a man
