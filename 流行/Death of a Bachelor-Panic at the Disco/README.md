《 **Death of a Bachelor** 》是美国阿拉斯加摇滚乐队Panic! at the
Disco演唱的歌曲，收录在其于2016年1月15日发行的同名音乐专辑《Death Of A Bachelor》中。

光怪陆离的前奏过后，听前面以为是首向Frank
Sinatra致敬的复古爵士，谁知副歌一出来，竟是爆发式的摇滚唱法，融合Trap重重的节拍、爵士管乐、R&B的响指，听起来另类又怀旧、大气浮诡，肃穆中又充满着会玩的戏谑感！超赞！

### Death of a Bachelor歌词：

Do I look lonely  
I see the shadows on my face  
People have told me  
I don't look the same  
Maybe I lost weight  
I'm playing hooky  
With the best of the best  
Put my heart on my chest  
So that you can see it too  
I'm walking the long road  
Watching the sky fall  
The lace in your dress  
Tingles my neck  
How do I live  
The death of a bachelor  
Oh oh  
Letting the water fall  
The death of a bachelor  
Oh oh  
Seems so fitting for  
Happily ever after  
Oo  
How could I ask for more  
A lifetime of laughter  
At the expense of the death of a bachelor  
I'm cutting my mind off  
Feels like my heart is going to burst  
Alone at a table for two  
And I just wanna be served  
And when you think of me  
Am I the best you've ever had  
Share one more drink with me  
Smile even though you're sad  
I'm walking the long road  
Watching the sky fall  
The lace in your dress  
Tingles my neck  
How do I live  
The death of a bachelor  
Oh oh  
Letting the water fall  
The death of a bachelor  
Oh oh  
Seems so fitting for  
Happily ever after  
Oo  
How could I ask for more  
A lifetime of laughter  
At the expense of the death of a bachelor  
The death of a bachelor  
Oh oh  
Letting the water fall  
The death of a bachelor  
Oh oh  
Seems so fitting for  
Happily ever after  
Oo  
How could I ask for more  
A lifetime of laughter  
At the expense of the death of a bachelor
