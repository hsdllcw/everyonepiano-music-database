### Heart of Glass歌词：

Once had a love and it was a gas  
It soon turned out I had a heart of glass  
Seemed like the real thing only to find  
Much o' mistrust love's gone behind  
Once had a love and it was divine  
I soon found out I was losing my mind  
It seemed like the real thing but I was so blind  
Much o' mistrust love's gone behind  
In between what I find is pleasing and I'm feeling fine  
Love is so confusing there's no peace of mind  
If I fear I'm losing you it's just no good  
You teasing like you do  
Once had a love and it was a gas  
It soon turned out I had a heart of glass  
Seemed like the real thing only to find  
Much o' mistrust love's gone behind  
Lost inside adorable illusion and I cannot hide  
I'm the one you're using please don't push me aside  
We could've made it cruising yeah  
Riding high on love's true bluish light  
Once I had a love and it was a gas  
It soon turned out to be a pain in the a*s  
Seemed like the real thing only to find  
Much o' mistrust love's gone behind
