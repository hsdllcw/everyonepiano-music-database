**Aurora** 是K-391与RØRY一同合作的单曲，发行于2020年10月。

深邃又欢快的Intro，共鸣的错位鼓声还有熟悉的Synth
Lead，让我们再次恍惚到了另一个世界，这的确很“K-391”。不断的变故并没有让K-391停歇，不仅如此还把久未释放的力量全部注入了这曲《
_Aurora_
》。它以爱之名去探索未知的世界，因为极光的美丽绚烂让你欲罢不能。并入细腻绝美的女声更是很符合这幅图景，让你顶着一片极光去巡礼极光女神的圣地。

### Aurora歌词：

I've been looking through my memories  
I've been tryna see your face  
But you're moving like a mystery  
And you look the other way  
If you found me in the pouring rain  
Would you let me in  
Would you look into your memories  
Tell me where you've been  
When the sun is going down  
I feel you coming closer  
Counting in the dark  
I feel at home  
I see you light up the sky  
A dance in the night  
Aurora  
I see the stars in your eyes  
Believe in your lies  
Aurora  
Mine for a moment and then you're gone  
And I'm still holding on  
To a light in the sky  
A dance in the night  
Aurora  
Feeling almost like a secret  
Hidden in an emerald sea  
And I'm drowning in your green eyes  
Got that power over me  
If I told you how I really feel  
Would you let me in  
Would you tell me all your secrets  
Tell me where you've been  
When the sun is going down  
I feel you coming closer  
Counting in the dark  
I feel at home  
I see you light up the sky  
A dance in the night  
Aurora  
I see the stars in your eyes  
Believe in your lies  
Aurora  
Mine for a moment and then you're gone  
And I'm still holding on  
To a light in the sky  
A dance in the night  
Aurora  
I see you light up the sky  
A dance in the night  
Aurora  
I see the stars in your eyes  
Believe in your lies  
Aurora  
Mine for a moment and then you're gone  
And I'm still holding on  
To a light in the sky  
A dance in the night  
Aurora
