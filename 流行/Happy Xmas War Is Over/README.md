**Happy Xmas (War Is Over)** ，译为《圣诞快乐（战争结束了）》，是John Lennon与Yoko
Ono于1971年所推出的单曲。此曲在美国并未上榜但是却在英国单曲榜上夺得了第四名的好成绩（由于发行推迟，此曲与1972年才开始发行）。此曲也往往作为一首越南战争的抗议歌曲，而由于这首歌同样也是首圣诞歌曲，它往往能在其他一些圣诞音乐专辑中出现。

该曲曾多次被其他歌手翻唱，包括席琳•迪翁，冲突乐队及魔力红等人皆翻唱过这首歌。

### Happy Xmas (War Is Over)歌词：

Happy Xmas, Kyoko  
Happy Xmas, Julian  
So this is Xmas  
And what have you done  
Another year over  
And a new one just begun  
And so this is Xmas  
I hope you have fun  
The near and the dear one  
The old and the young  
A very Merry Xmas  
And a happy New Year  
Let's hope it's a good one  
Without any fear  
And so this is Xmas (war is over)  
For weak and for strong (if you want it)  
For rich and the poor ones (war is over)  
The road is so long (now)  
And so happy Xmas (war is over)  
For black and for white (if you want it)  
For yellow and red ones (war is over)  
Let's stop all the fight (now)  
A very Merry Xmas  
And a happy New Year  
Let's hope it's a good one  
Without any fear  
And so this is Xmas (war is over)  
And what have we done (if you want it)  
Another year over (war is over)  
A new one just begun (now)  
And so happy Xmas (war is over)  
We hope you have fun (if you want it)  
The near and the dear one (war is over)  
The old and the young (now)  
A very Merry Xmas  
And a happy New Year  
Let's hope it's a good one  
Without any fear  
War is over, if you want it  
War is over now  
Happy Xmas
