### Snap歌词：

It's 4 AM  
I can't turn my head off  
Wishing these memories would fade they never do  
Turns out people lie  
They say just snap your fingers  
As if it was really that easy for me to get over you  
I just need time  
Snappin' one two  
Where are you  
You're still in my heart  
Snappin' three four  
Don't need you here anymore  
Get out of my heart  
'Cause I might snap  
I'm writin' a song  
Said this is the last one  
How many last songs are left I'm losing count  
Since June 22nd  
My heart's been on fire  
I was spendin' my nights in the rain tryna put it out  
So I'm snappin' one two  
Where are you  
You're still in my heart  
Snappin' three four  
Don't need you here anymore  
Get out of my heart  
'Cause I might snap  
Oh-oh-oh-ohh  
'Cause I might snap  
Oh-oh-oh-ohh  
And if one more person says you should get over it  
Oh I might stop talking to people before I snap snap snap  
Oh I might stop talking to people before I snap  
Snappin' one two  
Where are you where are you  
You're still in my heart still in my heart  
Snappin' three four  
Don't need you here anymore need you here anymore  
Get out of my heart  
'Cause I might sna-yeah oh-oh-oh-ohh snap  
'Cause I might sna-yeah oh-oh-oh-ohh snap  
Get out of my heart yeah yeah yeah yeah heart  
'Cause I might snap oh-oh-oh-ohh  
Get out of my heart yeah  
'Cause I might snap
