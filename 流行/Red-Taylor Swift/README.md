### Red歌词：

Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead end street  
爱他的感觉犹如将崭新的玛莎拉蒂开向绝路  
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin,ending so suddenly  
狂风般迅疾，激昂得罪恶，结束于恍惚  
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying
through the free fall  
爱他的感觉犹如坠入深渊时却寻不到回路  
Like the colors in autumn so bright just before they lose it all  
犹如秋天那抹在失色黯淡前无比艳丽的彩幕  
Losing him was blue, like I’d never known  
失去他如此忧伤，好像我们从未相识  
Missing him was dark gray, all alone  
想念他如同灰暗般无助，孤独中无法忘却  
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met  
将他遗忘好比去了解一个素未谋面的人那样痛苦漫长  
But loving him was red  
但我记得爱他的感觉如亮红般炽烈  
Loving him was red  
爱他的感觉如同亮红般炽烈  
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front
of you  
触碰他时仿佛你曾期许的一切就在眼前  
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song  
对他的记忆犹如你最钟爱歌谣的旋律般挥之不去  
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's
no right answer  
与他争执每每如同解开一个没有答案的字谜一般不了了之  
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that
strong  
对他离去的懊悔让你宁愿没有碰到这样一段坚定的爱情  
Losing him was blue, like I’d never known  
失去他如此忧伤，好像我们从未相识  
Missing him was dark gray, all alone  
想念他如同灰暗般无助，孤独中无法忘却  
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met  
将他遗忘好比去了解一个素未谋面的人那样痛苦漫长  
But loving him was red,  
但爱他的感觉如同亮红般炽烈  
oh red, burning red  
燃烧着的，烈焰般的鲜红  
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes  
关于我们过往的残片断章不断回响重映  
Tell myself it's time now gotta let go  
我告诉自己是时候该放手释怀  
But moving on from him is impossible when I still see it all in my head…  
但每当他的脸庞浮现在脑海中时我都无暇顾及其他  
in burning red  
像是陷入了狂热燃烧的鲜红  
burning, it was red  
焚烧着的那抹鲜红  
Losing him was blue, like ’d never known  
失去他如同深蓝般悲伤，好像我们从未相识  
Missing him was dark gray, all alone  
想念他如灰暗般无助，孤独中无法忘却  
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met  
将他遗忘好比去了解一个素未谋面的人那样痛苦漫长  
Cause loving him was red, yeah yeah red, burning red  
因为爱他的感觉如同亮红般炽烈，难以忘怀  
And that’s why he’s spinning around in my head  
这也是他萦绕在我思绪中的原因  
Comes back to me in burning red  
再让我回到那炽热的爱恋中吧  
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead end street  
爱他的感觉犹如将崭新的玛莎拉蒂开向绝路
