### Privacy歌词：

I need your body in ways  
That you don't understand but I'm losing my patience  
'Cause we've been going over and over again  
Girl, I just wanna take you home and get right to it  
Know I gotta kiss it, baby  
Give it to me, we can take it inside now  
You know that I just wanna make love  
Want you to scream and shout  
And baby, when I'm deep in it now  
I'ma slow it down, 'cause ain't no speed limit  
When we're moving at the speed of sound  
We gon' turn all the way up when the lights down  
Why your pussy so damn good, miss lady?  
Go and put that booty up, baby, one on one  
You know I'ma go crazy when your legs in the air  
You know your panties never getting in the way  
You know I kinda like it, when you make me work for it  
Ayy you, girl, with the tight up skirt  
Get that ass in the bed, I'ma lock the door  
Shake that ass like boom shakalaka, boom shakalaka  
We don't need nobody watching us  
No eyes but your eyes  
Ain't nobody here but you and me  
Licking your private parts  
And I know you love your privacy  
You don't need a shower, you already wet  
Know that pussy power, telling me I ain't ready yet  
I say, Fuck it, face my fears, baby  
When I lick it, I put tears in it  
Put my face in it, eat it like a dinner date  
You know I love foreplay, 12 play, everything  
Know my lovin' don't change  
I don't really give a fuck what a hater say  
'Cause you fine, baby  
And it's alright 'cause you're all mine, baby, ooh, hoo  
Girl, I'ma let you get crazy  
Ayy you, girl, with the tight up skirt  
Get that ass in the bed, I'ma lock the door  
Shake that ass like boom shakalaka, boom shakalaka  
We don't need nobody watching us  
No eyes but your eyes  
Ain't nobody here but you and me  
Licking your private parts  
And I know you love your privacy  
Baby, I promise I won’t tell nobody  
Just long as you let me hit it like every night  
I could give a fuck ‘bout the club, 'cause that pussy tight  
Do a split on it, drop it, baby, show you right  
I'ma split your weave and you askin' me to stay the night  
Whipped cream on your titties, then you suckin' on my dick with ice  
Oh my God, oh my God, my bitch get me right  
Ain't gotta pay for that pussy, my dick can change your life  
I'm tired of missionary, wanna see you on your face  
Put that ass up in the air, I'm lovin' how that pussy taste  
Damn, on your side, on your side  
Stop runnin' from this dick, I ain't 'bout to let you slide this time  
Ayy you, girl, with the tight up skirt  
Get that ass in the bed, I'ma lock the door  
Shake that ass like boom shakalaka, boom shakalaka (Boom, boom)  
We don't need nobody watching us (Yikes!)  
No eyes but your eyes  
Ain't nobody here but you and me  
Licking your private parts (Boom shakalaka, hahaha)  
And I know you love your privacy  
Privacy  
Boom shakalaka  
Hahaha
