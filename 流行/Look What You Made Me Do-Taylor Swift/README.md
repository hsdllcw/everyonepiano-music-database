Swift的新单。她的歌为她赢得了最大的歌迷群：年轻人。她写歌的习惯也成为捕获年轻人的杀手锏，她以写自己的成长经历闻名，歌曲里都是青春的味道，这一点正好切合了年轻歌迷的心，他们能听懂歌曲的内容，自然就会产生共鸣，从青春期开始，这一路下来，会有一批歌迷跟着她一起成长。她很善于利用她年轻这个优势。舞台上耀眼的Taylor，已和昔日的淳朴女孩大相径庭。她的歌中鼻音也越来越少，取而代之的是流行音乐常用的“气泡音”，她播撒在乡村音乐土壤中的种子，发芽后越来越向流行音乐生长。

### Look What You Made Me Do歌词：

I don't like your little games  
Don't like your titled stage  
The role you made me play  
Of the fool no I don't like you  
I don't like your perfect crime  
How you laugh when you lie  
You said the gun was mine  
Isn't cool no I don't like you  
But I got smarter I got harder in the nick of time  
Honey I rose up from the dead I do it all the time  
I've got a list of names and yours is in red underlined  
I check it once then I check it twice oh  
Ooh look what you made me do  
Look what you made me do  
Look what you just made me do  
Look what you just made me do  
Ooh look what you made me do  
Look what you made me do  
Look what you just made me do  
Look what you just made me do  
I don't like your kingdom keys  
They once belonged to me  
You ask me for a place to sleep  
Locked me out and threw a feast what  
The world goes on another day another drama drama  
But not for me not for me all I think about is karma  
And then the world moves on but one thing's for sure  
Baby I got mine but you'll all get yours  
But I got smarter I got harder in the nick of time  
Honey I rose up from the dead I do it all the time  
I've got a list of names and yours is in red underlined  
I check it once then I check it twice  
Ooh look what you made me do  
Look what you made me do  
Look what you just made me do  
Look what you just made me do  
Ooh look what you made me do  
Look what you made me do  
Look what you just made me do  
Look what you just made me do  
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me  
I'll be the actress star in your bad dreams  
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me  
I'll be the actress star in your bad dreams  
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me  
I'll be the actress star in your bad dreams  
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me  
I'll be the actress star in your bad dreams  
Ooh look what you made me do  
Look what you made me do  
Look what you just made me do  
Look what you just made me do  
Ooh look what you made me do  
Look what you made me do  
Look what you just made me do  
Ooh look what you made me do  
Look what you made me do  
Look what you just made me do  
Look what you just made me do  
Ooh look what you made me do  
Look what you made me do  
Look what you just made me do  
Look what you just made me do  
Ooh look what you made me do  
Look what you made me do  
Look what you just made me do  
Look what you just made me do  
Ooh look what you made me do  
Look what you made me do  
Look what you just made me do  
Look what you just made me do
