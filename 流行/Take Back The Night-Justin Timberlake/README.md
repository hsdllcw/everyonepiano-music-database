### Take Back The Night歌词：

Yeah, uh, feels good, don't it?  
Listen, uh

Yeah, this was your city  
You did it all and more, broke every law except for one, babe  
Attraction, are you ready  
I know you feel it  
Pull you nearer ’til you feel it again, oh

I wanna do something right  
But we can do something better  
Ain’t no time like tonight  
And we ain’t trying to save it ’til later  
Stay out here living the life  
Nobody cares who we are tomorrow  
You got that lil’ something I like  
A little something I’ve been wanting to borrow  
Tonight the night’s, come on surrender  
I won’t lead your love astray, astray, yeah  
Your love’s a weapon  
Give your body some direction  
That’s my aim  
Then, we could  
Take back the night  
Come on, use me up until there’s nothing left  
Take back the night  
Dizzy, spinning, sweating, you can’t catch your breath  
Take back the night  
Ooh, don’t know when the sun is rising next  
Take back the night  
So if the feeling’s right, then raise your glass and let’s

Take back the night,  
take back the night  
They gon’ try to shut us down,  
I’ll be damned if we gon’ let them  
Take back the night, take back the night  
You know you gon’ mess around and find out there ain’t no one better  
Take back the night, oh  
Yeah

Rare, there’s not too many  
No one but you and crowded rooms, we can do anything (yeah)  
Attraction can drive you crazy  
The way you move, you go crazy, that’s incentive for me

I wanna do something right  
But we can do something better  
Ain’t no time like tonight  
And we ain’t trying to save it ’til later  
Stay out here living the life  
Nobody cares who we are tomorrow  
You got that lil’ something I like  
A little something I’ve been wanting to borrow  
Tonight the night’s, come on surrender  
I won’t lead your love astray, astray, yeah  
Your love’s a weapon  
Give your body some direction  
That’s my aim  
Then, we could

Take back the night  
Come on, use me up until there’s nothing left  
Take back the night  
Dizzy, spinning, sweating, you can’t catch your breath  
Take back the night  
Ooh, don’t know when the sun is rising next  
Take back the night  
So if the feeling’s right, then raise your glass and let’s

Take back the night, take back the night  
They gon’ try to shut us down, I’ll be damned if we gon’ let them  
Take back the night, take back the night  
You know you gon’ mess around and find out there ain’t no one better

And the horns say, alright  
And the horns say, alright  
Uh, ooh, and the horns say, alright  
And the horns say  
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo  
Take it over  
Yeah, yeah

Y’all ready to have a good time out there, ladies and gentlemen?  
Take back the night, take back the night...

Take back the night  
Ooh, don’t know when the sun is rising next  
Take back the night  
So if the feeling’s right, then raise your glass and let’s  
Take back the night, take back the night  
They gon’ try to shut us down, I’ll be damned if we gon’ let them  
Take back the night, take back the night  
You know you gon’ mess around and find out there ain’t no one better  
And the horns say, alright  
And the horns say  
And the horns say  
And the horns say, alright
