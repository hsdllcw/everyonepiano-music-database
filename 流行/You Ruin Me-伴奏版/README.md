### You Ruin Me歌词：

Job well done  
Standing ovation  
Yeah you got what you wanted  
I guess you won  
And I don't want to hear, they don't know you like I do  
Even I could've told you  
But now we're done

'Cause you play me like a symphony  
Play me till your fingers bleed  
I'm your greatest masterpiece  
You ruin me  
Later when the curtains drawn  
And no one's there for you back home  
Don't cry to me, you played me wrong  
You ruin me

I know you thought  
That I wouldn't notice  
You were acting so strange  
I'm not that dumb  
And in the end I hope she was worth it  
I don't care if you loved me, you make me numb

'Cause you play me like a symphony  
Play me till your fingers bleed  
I'm your greatest masterpiece  
You ruin me  
Later when the curtains drawn  
And no one's there for you back home  
Don't cry to me, you played me wrong  
You ruin me

We're that song you wouldn't sing  
Just a broken melody  
You're killing me

You play me like a symphony  
Play me till your fingers bleed  
I'm your greatest masterpiece  
You ruin me  
Later when the curtains drawn  
And no one's there for you back home  
Don't cry to me you played me wrong  
You ruin me
