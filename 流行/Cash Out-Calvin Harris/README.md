### Cash Out歌词：

You can rock it, you can sock it  
You can even put on your brand new jacket  
Because I'm the man who can put you in the musical brackets  
Uh, party like it's 1980  
Where the afro shiny and the girls all purty  
Where the white girl molly  
And a dark-skinned Kylie, can I rock both bodies? Ayy  
New 'Rari, how I ride, both shotty, uh  
Keep your table, can we boogie on the floor?  
I've been stressin' all week, tryna clear it through the door now  
Ballin' like LeBron now, shots like a pro now  
Hella weed, yeah, it goes 'round  
Let me tell you how it goes down  
I ain't drivin' when it's goin', now pour me another cup  
This your favorite song on, don't tell me you in a rush  
When I give you all I have, you tell me it ain't enough  
I've been tryna clear our mind and wine and dine ya  
See I know just how you like it, I'll back behind ya  
If I look up at the stars, ain't hard to find ya, ayy  
Passin' all them neighbors, cash out (cash out)  
Smashin' all them 'Raris, dash out (dash out)  
'Member all them nights we used to trap out?  
Now we count until we pass out  
Passin' all them neighbors, cash out (cash out)  
Smashin' all them 'Raris, dash out (dash out)  
'Member all them nights we used to trap out?  
Now we count it up until we pass out  
Yo, uh, we gon' party like it's 1980  
In a buggy-eyed 'Cedes or a dopeboy Caddy  
With a nickel bag baggie, gold Rolex  
Timin' for your climax climbin', got the bedsheets jumpin'  
With your heartbeat pumpin' and your love keep comin'  
Shake somethin', break somethin', shit, I'm tryna work somethin'  
Sho' you right, motorbike, you could ride me overnight, uh  
Never been one to judge, we rushin' back to the club  
Put it down from above, your body my only drug  
We do it like Vegas, rich and famous  
We doin' it major, we wakin' the neighbors  
Passin' all them neighbors, cash out (cash out)  
Smashin' all them 'Raris, dash out (dash out)  
'Member all them nights we used to trap out?  
Now we count until we pass out  
Passin' all them neighbors, cash out (cash out)  
Smashin' all them 'Raris, dash out (dash out)  
'Member all them nights we used to trap out?  
Now we count it up until we pass out
