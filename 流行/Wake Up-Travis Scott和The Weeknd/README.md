### Wake Up歌词：

The Weeknd：  
I don't wanna wake up  
I want you spread out on the sheets  
Said her p**sy so good  
And her p**sy so sweet oh  
I don't wanna wake up  
I want it flowing through my streams  
Getting me hot  
Under my feet  
I don't wanna wake up  
Travis Scott：  
Please don't wake me up I feel it creeping yeah  
Controlling how you moving lucid dreaming dreams  
Always on the side of different seasons yeah yeah  
Took the belt-way down to your hood it's lit  
Say you was in the crowd I never looked  
Looking back how things came back around  
Guess I was hooked  
Burn the bread and then we burn the town  
We both was cooked yeah  
Nah nah please don't wake me up feel like I'm dreamin'  
Any given Sunday you can get it Willie Beamen  
I can make your Mondays even better like the weekend yeah  
That's my coco I'm her Ice-T coco  
Bend her over for some piping it's lit  
Bust a cloud shoot the lightning pop it  
Pop it now no we can't sleep  
The Weeknd：  
I don't wanna wake up yeah  
Want you spread out on the sheets it's lit  
Say p**sy so good pop it  
Oh p**sy so sweet yeah  
When I wake up yeah yeah  
Wanna drop top on the beach straight up  
Getting me high yeah yeah  
Under my feet  
When I wake up  
The Weeknd：  
You decide if I live or die  
When you're close I'm alive I can feel the sky  
I just want your body close to me oh  
And if I OD  
I'll be alone with no heartbeat  
I hold the hills with a coast in the Lambo  
And the doors going up suicide  
I don't wanna wake up  
I don't wanna wake up  
I want you spread out on the sheets  
Want you spread out on the sheets  
'Cause that p**sy so good  
P**sy so good yeah  
Girl that p**sy so sweet  
So sweet  
I don't wanna wake up  
I don't wanna wake up  
I want it flowing through my streams  
Want it flowing through my streams  
Ha getting me hot  
Getting me hot  
Oh under my feet  
My feet  
I don't wanna wake up yeah
