### Lullaby歌词：

All the time I have laid in your love  
When your love kept me safe through the night  
All the time I was sure you were mine  
And before time demands our goodbye  
Can you sing me a last lullaby?

It's been a while since I last dreamt  
Barely remember what it's like to dream  
Finding it hard to get to sleep, too stressed  
And there ain't anyone to sing a lullaby to me  
Pretend shit doesn't get to me  
And I suffer in silence when I'm hurting  
A man's problems are his own  
And it's my burden  
Tossing and turning, trying to get to sleep  
But I find it hard to switch off when my mind's working  
I ponder on things I shouldn't ponder on  
Off the rails, my train of thought's wandering  
Sick of pretending to be so happy  
All the while my anxiety's away at me  
My skin crawling, I look up to the sky  
And it falls, the walls close in and it's  
As if all the good in my life disappears  
In an instant, that thing is just so distant  
So seeing the ones who I love, the ones who love me  
But I don't wanna tell em how I feel in case they judge me  
It's just me, wish I could let somebody in  
But I ain't ever been too trusting

All the time I have laid in your love  
When your love kept me safe through the night  
All the time I was sure you were mine  
And before time demands our goodbye  
Can you sing me a last lullaby?

I've barely had any sleep when I get up  
Sick of all these nightmares and these night terrors  
Like it's only when I'm in heaven that I sleep better  
Might sleep better when I get up, I'm weak  
It just makes my day harder, I wonder if  
It would've been any different if I had a father that I knew  
Could it have helped shape the way that I grew?  
But the point of things I never have went from  
Being a reason for the things that I do  
To just being an excuse that I'd use  
I've gotta take responsibility for the things I do  
Find something other than negativity for my fuel  
But I feed off it, even when I don't seem bothered  
I hide everything that's going on inside  
Guess it's been a while since I've been honest, I need help  
But I deny it and even lie to myself like I'm fine

All the time I have laid in your love  
When your love kept me safe through the night  
All the time I was sure you were mine  
And before time demands our goodbye  
Can you sing me a last lullaby?

I just wish someone would tell me it would be OK  
But pessimism leads me to believe that it won't  
To see even a glimmer of hope in the darkness  
Is hard and depression is a slippery slope  
I don't wanna do what my dad did with a rope, though  
So I carry on even though it's hard to  
The only thing that's definite is death and things always change  
As long as you give em a chance to

All the time I have laid in your love  
When your love kept me safe through the night  
All the time I was sure you were mine  
And before time demands our goodbye  
Can you sing me a last lullaby?

(Can you sing me a last lullaby?)

All the time I have laid in your love  
When your love kept me safe through the night  
All the time I was sure you were mine  
And before time demands our goodbye  
Where you sing me a last lullaby?
