### Rise歌词：

I won't just survive  
Oh, you will see me thrive  
Can't write my story  
I'm beyond the archetype

I won't just conform  
No matter how you shake my core  
'Cause my roots they run deep, oh

Oh, ye of so little faith  
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it  
Victory is in my veins  
I know it, I know it  
And I will not negotiate  
I'll fight it, I'll fight it  
I will transform

When, when the fire's at my feet again  
And the vultures all start circling  
They're whispering, "You're out of time”  
But still I rise

This is no mistake, no accident  
When you think the final nail is in  
Think again  
Don't be surprised  
I will still rise

I must stay conscious  
Through the madness and chaos  
So I call on my angels  
They say

Oh, ye of so little faith  
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it  
Victory is in your veins  
You know it, you know it  
And you will not negotiate  
Just fight it, just fight it  
And be transformed

'Cause when, when the fire's at my feet again  
And the vultures all start circling  
They're whispering, "You're out of time”  
But still I rise

This is no mistake, no accident  
When you think the final nail is in  
Think again  
Don't be surprised  
I will still rise

Don't doubt it, don't doubt it  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
You know it, you know it  
Still rise  
Just fight it, just fight it  
Don't be surprised  
I will still rise
