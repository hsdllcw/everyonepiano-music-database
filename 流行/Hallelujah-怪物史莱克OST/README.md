**Hallelujah**
为美国好莱坞导演安德鲁•亚当森、艾伦•华纳执导的动画作品《怪物史莱克》的插曲。该作品改编自知名童书作家威廉•史泰格的同名绘本，影片笑点在于“嘲讽所有的经典童话，并颠覆了一般人对童话故事的刻版印象。”

Hallelujah_ 原唱为加拿大著名游吟诗人、民谣歌手Leonard Cohen收录在其专辑"Various
Positions"中。其歌词充满诗意，内涵丰富，曲调缓慢忧伤，加上Leonard沧桑嗓音的低吟浅唱，演绎出了一种清淡而悠长的回味。

  
而此曲版本很多，该版本来自于加拿大裔美国创作歌手Rufus Wainwright。他发表了五张原创音乐专辑，数张EP，与许多收录于合辑与电影原声带中的歌曲。

### Hallelujah歌词：

I've heard there was a secret chord  
That David played, and it pleased the Lord  
But you don't really care for music, do you?  
It goes like this  
The fourth, the fifth  
The minor fall, the major lift  
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof  
You saw her bathing on the roof  
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you  
She tied you to a kitchen chair  
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair  
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe I have been here before  
I know this room, I've walked this floor  
I used to live alone before I knew you  
I've seen your flag on the marble arch  
Love is not a victory march  
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

There was a time you let me know  
What's real and going on below  
But now you never show it to me, do you?  
And remember when I moved in you?  
The holy dark was moving too  
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe there's a god above  
And all I ever learned from love  
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you  
And it's not a cry you can hear at night,  
It's not somebody who's seen the light  
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
