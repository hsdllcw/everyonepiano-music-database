**Time** 出自英国摇滚乐队Pink Floyd的专辑The Dark Side of the
Moon。他们最初以迷幻与太空摇滚音乐赢得知名度，而后逐渐发展为前卫摇滚音乐。

Dark Side of the
Moon做为他们发布的第9部专辑。整部专辑为6首歌曲加4首背景效果音乐，采用不停顿的方式连续演绎，给人一气呵成的感觉。整部专辑被看成一首完整的曲目而不是专辑里所有歌曲的简单集合。它似乎是主要针对转瞬即逝且充满罪恶的人类生命，这也是摇滚乐中最常见的主题素材。

_Time_
此曲表现的是对光阴虚度的追悔和对故乡的眷恋，歌中这段歌词相当富有哲理“你跑呀跑，与太阳并驾齐驱，它落山了，跑了一个来回，又出现在你身后，太阳在对应的方式里是相同的，不过你却渐渐衰老，呼吸短促，离死亡的日子越来越近”。这首歌曲在David
Gilmour强有力的吉他伴奏下呈现出一种美妙的乡村风格演绎。

### Time歌词：

Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day  
Fritter and waste the hours in an off-hand way  
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town  
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way

Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain  
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today  
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you  
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking  
Racing around to come up behind you again  
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older  
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death

Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time  
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines  
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way  
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say

Home, home again  
I like to be here when I can  
When I come home cold and tired  
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire  
Far away, across the field  
The tolling of the iron bell  
Calls the faithful to their knees  
To hear the softly spoken magic spell
