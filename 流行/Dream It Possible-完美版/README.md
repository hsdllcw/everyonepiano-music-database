### Dream It Possible歌词：

I will run, I will climb, I will soar  
I'm undefeated, ooh  
Jumping out of my skin, pull the chord  
Yeah I believe it, ooh  
The past is everything we were  
Don't make us who we are  
So I'll dream, until I make it real  
And all I see is stars  
It's not until you fall that you fly  
When your dreams come alive you're unstoppable  
Take a shot, chase the sun, find the beautiful  
We will glow in the dark turning dust to gold  
And we'll dream it possible  
Possible, ooh  
And we'll dream it possible  
I will chase, I will reach, I will fly  
Until I'm breaking, until I'm breaking  
Out of my cage, like a bird in the night  
I know I'm changing, I know I'm changing  
In, into something big  
Better than before  
And if it takes, takes a thousand lives  
Then it's worth fighting for  
It's not until you fall that you fly  
When your dreams come alive you're unstoppable  
Take a shot, chase the sun, find the beautiful  
We will glow in the dark turning dust to gold  
And we'll dream it possible, ooooh  
It possible, oh, ooh  
From the bottom to the top  
We're sparking wild fires  
Never quit and never stop  
The rest of our lives  
From the bottom to the top  
We're sparking wild fires  
Never quit and never stop  
It's not until you fall that you fly  
When your dreams come alive you're unstoppable  
Take a shot, chase the sun, find the beautiful  
We will glow in the dark, turning dust to gold  
And we'll dream it possible  
Possible, ooh  
And we'll dream it possible
