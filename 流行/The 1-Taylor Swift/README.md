**The 1** ，中文译为《唯一》，是美国创作歌手Taylor
Swift的一首歌曲，于2020年7月24日由联众唱片发行，收录于她第八张录音室专辑《Folklore》。

作为整张专辑的序曲，《 _The 1_
》安然而不静冷，恬静而不浮嚣，婉转而不厚重，简真而不虚空。极简的旋律，平缓中速鼓点，层层递进的情感深入，恰到好处的副歌处合声点缀，歌声背后浅淡均匀的合成器音效，这是一种别样的韵致，更是一种艺术。就好像晨曦荡漾在夏日森林里，其中轻然信步，蓦然回首，这森林背后一条曲折的路：一段浪漫情怀，一段黑暗阴郁，一段功成名就，一段失落颓然，当这一切风雨后的森林里，她留下的每一个脚印都镶着碎金般的阳光，熠熠生辉，永不褪色。

### The 1歌词：

I'm doing good  
I'm on some new s**t  
Been saying "yes" instead of "no"  
I thought I saw you at the bus stop  
I didn't though  
I hit the ground running each night  
I hit the Sunday matinee  
You know the greatest films of all time were never made  
I guess you never know never know  
And if you wanted me you really should've showed  
And if you never bleed you're never gonna grow  
And it's alright now  
But we were something  
Don't you think so  
Roaring twenties  
Tossing pennies in the pool  
And if my wishes came true  
It would've been you  
In my defense  
I have none  
For never leaving well enough alone  
But it would've been fun  
If you would've been the one  
I have this dream  
You're doing cool s**t  
Having adventures on your own  
You meet some woman on the Internet  
And take her home  
We never painted by the numbers baby  
But we were making it count  
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now  
I guess you never know never know  
And it's another day waking up alone  
But we were something  
Don't you think so  
Roaring twenties  
Tossing pennies in the pool  
And if my wishes came true  
It would've been you  
In my defense  
I have none  
For never leaving well enough alone  
But it would've been fun  
If you would've been the one  
I persist and resist the temptation to ask you  
If one thing had been different  
Would everything be different today  
We were something  
Don't you think so  
Rosé flowing with your chosen family  
And it would've been sweet  
If it could've been me  
In my defense  
I have none  
For digging up the grave another time  
But it would've been fun  
If you would've been the one  
Ooh
