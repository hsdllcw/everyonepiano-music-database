### Party Girl歌词：

Girls just wanna have fun  
So they party so they party  
Lil' mama a party girl  
She just wan' have fun too  
They say you ain't wifey type but I don't care I want you  
She like to do drugs too  
She in love with guns too  
They say you too piped up but I think that I love you  
Lil' mama a party girl  
She just wan' have fun too  
They say you ain't wifey type but I don't care I want you  
She like to do drugs too  
She in love with guns too  
They say you too piped up but I think that I love you  
She don't want nobody  
She don't need somebody  
I'm tryna be with you so you don't be without me  
She tote 'em just like me no we can't leave without it  
She boo'd up off the meth like she can't breathe without it  
She drinkin' Four Lokos I can't get with those  
She wan' gimme throat throat I tell her come close  
She say "You say you love me but I don't know what love means"  
I ask her who got her heart cause d**n that n***a lucky  
I been tryna reach for it but it's too far above me  
I ain't never do you wrong so tell me why you don't trust me  
She don't do this often she said it's only because me  
You the one who wanted it therefore you can never judge me  
She just wanna party and nothing's wrong with that  
Every time I'm calling she say she gon' call me back  
I told her call me Rocky she say she not gon' call me that  
You say you come with a lot well baby I want all of that  
Lil' mama a party girl  
She just wan' have fun too  
They say you ain't wifey type but I don't care I want you  
She like to do drugs too  
She in love with guns too  
They say you too piped up but I think that I love you  
Lil' mama a party girl  
She just wan' have fun too  
They say you ain't wifey type but I don't care I want you  
She like to do drugs too  
She in love with guns too  
They say you too piped up but I think that I love you  
Don't be scared to party don't be scared to party  
Don't be scared to party
