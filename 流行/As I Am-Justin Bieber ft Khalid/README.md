**As I Am** 是流行天王Justin Bieber与Khalid一同合作的单曲，收录在Bieber的录音室专辑《Justice》中。

《 _As I Am_ 》选取了积极的角度，回顾 Bieber
的亲身经历。他表示：“我喜欢这首歌，因为它传达了希望的信息。包括我在内的很多人会觉得自己不值得被爱。因此，歌的钩子讲到：接受我的全部，我也会尽其所能。这是我自己对妻子的承诺。我会坚定不移地守在这里——我就是这样，要么接受。要么走开。”

### As I Am歌词：

By myself sometimes to give my mind some space  
Yeah I know yeah I know that it hurts when push your love away  
I hate myself  
When I tell you lies so your heart won't break  
Yeah I know yeah I know that I made my fair share of mistakes  
Sometimes I don't know why you love me  
Sometimes I don't know why you care  
Take me with the good and the ugly  
Say "I'm not going anywhere"  
Take me as I am swear I'll do the best I can  
Say "I'm not going anywhere"  
Take mе as I am swear I'll do the best I can  
Say "I'm not going anywhere"  
Thousand miles apart yeah you're the one that holds my heart  
It's no surprise  
And I tell you all the time  
And when life gets way too hard  
I'll meet you in the stars you know I will  
I will keep you near  
mmm as I wipe away your tears mmm  
Yes  
Sometimes I don't know why you love me  
Sometimes I don't know why you care  
Take me with the good and the ugly  
Say "I'm not going anywhere"  
Take me as I am swear I'll do the best I can say  
"I'm not going anywhere"  
Take me as I am swear I'll do the best I can say  
"I'm not going anywhere"  
You were there for me when I was acting selfish  
And you prayed for me when I was out of faith  
You believed in me when ain't nobody else did  
It's a miracle you didn't run away  
You were there for me when I was acting selfish  
And you prayed for me when I was out of faith  
You believed in me when ain't nobody else did  
It's a miracle you didn't run away  
Sometimes I don't know why you love me  
Sometimes I don't know why you care  
Take me with the good and the ugly  
Say "I'm not going anywhere"
