### Favorite Girl 歌词：

Ah ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah oh  
Ah ah ah ah

I always knew you were the best  
The coolest girl I know  
So prettier than all the rest  
The star of my show  
So many times I wished  
You'd be the one for me  
But never knew you'd get like this  
Girl what you do to me

[Pre-chorus:]  
You're who I'm thinking of  
Girl you ain't my runner up  
And no matter what you're always number one

My prize possession  
One and only  
Adore ya girl I want ya  
The one I can't live without  
That's you that's you  
You're my special little lady  
The one that makes me crazy  
Of all the girls I've ever known  
It's you, it's you  
My favorite, my favorite  
My favorite, my favorite girl  
My favorite girl

You're used to going out your way  
To impress these Mr. Wrongs  
But you can be yourself with me  
I'll take you as you are  
I know they said believe in love  
Is a dream that cant be real  
So girl let's write a fairytale  
And show 'em how we feel

[Pre-chorus]

My prize possession  
One and only  
Adore ya girl I want ya  
The one I can`t live without  
That's you that's you  
You're my special little lady  
The one that makes me crazy  
Of all the girls I've ever known  
It's you, it's you  
My favorite, my favorite  
My favorite, my favorite girl  
My favorite girl  
Baby it's you  
My favorite, my favorite  
My favorite, my favorite girl  
My favorite girl

You take my breath away  
With everything you say  
I just wanna be with you  
My baby my baby oh  
Promise to play no games  
Treat you no other way  
Than you deserve 'cause you're the girl of my dreams

My prize possession  
One and only  
Adore ya girl I want ya  
The one I can`t live without  
That's you that's you  
You're my special little lady  
The one that makes me crazy  
Of all the girls I've ever known  
It's you, it's you

My prize possession  
One and only  
Adore ya girl I want ya  
The one I cant live without  
That's you that's you  
You're my special little lady  
The one that makes me crazy  
Of all the girls I've ever known  
It's you, it's you  
My favorite, my favorite  
My favorite, my favorite girl  
My favorite girl  
My favorite, my favorite  
My favorite, my favorite girl
