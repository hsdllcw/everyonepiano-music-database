### Cold Water歌词：

Everybody gets high sometimes, you know  
What else can we do when we're feeling low?  
So take a deep breath and let it go  
You shouldn't be drowning on your own  
And if you feel you're sinking, I will jump right over  
Into cold, cold water for you  
And although time may take us into different places  
I will still be patient with you  
And I hope you know  
I won't let go  
I'll be your lifeline tonight  
I won't let go  
I'll be your lifeline tonight  
Cause we all get lost sometimes, you know?  
It's how we learn and how we grow  
And I wanna lay with you 'til I'm old  
You shouldn't be fighting on your own  
And if you feel you're sinking, I will jump right over  
Into cold, cold water for you  
And although time may take us into different places  
I will still be patient with you  
And I hope you know  
I won't let go (I won't let go, no no, no no no no)  
I'll be your lifeline tonight  
I won't let go  
I'll be your lifeline tonight  
Come on, come on  
Standing from a rocking boat  
I just wanna stay afloat  
I'm all alone  
Now, now, someone come and take me home  
Somewhere out, and rest my soul  
I need to know（  
you won't go）  
I won't let go (I won't let go, no no, no no no no)  
I'll be your lifeline tonight  
I won't let go  
I'll be your lifeline tonight  
I won't let go  
I won't let go
