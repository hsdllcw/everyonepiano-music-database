### Diamond Heart歌词：

Hello sweet grief  
I know you'll be the death of me  
You're like the morning after ecstasy  
I am drowning in an endless sea  
Hello old friend  
There's the misery that knows no end  
So I'm doing everything I can  
To make sure I never love again  
I wish that I did not know  
Where all broken lovers go  
I wish that my heart was made of stone  
Yeah if I was bulletproof  
I'd love you black and blue  
If I was solid like a jewel  
If I had a diamond heart  
Oh oh  
I'd give you all my love  
If I was unbreakable  
If I had a diamond heart  
Oh oh  
You could shoot me with a gun of gold  
If I was unbreakable  
I'd walk straight through the bullet  
Bendin' like a tulip  
Blue-eyed and foolish  
Never mind the bruises  
Into the fire  
Breakin' through the wires  
Give you all I've got  
If I had a diamond heart  
I'd walk straight through the dagger  
Never break the pattern  
Diamonds don't shatter  
Beautiful and battered  
Into the poison  
Cry you an ocean  
Give you all I've got  
Goodbye so long  
I don't know if this is right or wrong  
Am I giving up where I belong  
'Cause every station is playing our song  
Goodbye my love  
You are everything my dreams made of  
You'll be prince and I'm the crying dove  
If I only were unbreakable  
I wish that I did not know  
Where our broken lovers go  
I wish that my heart was made of stone  
Yeah if I was bulletproof  
I'd love you black and blue  
If I was solid like a jewel  
If I had a diamond heart  
Oh oh  
I'd give you all my love  
If I was unbreakable  
If I had a diamond heart  
Oh oh  
You could shoot me with a gun of gold  
If I was unbreakable  
I'd walk straight through the bullet  
Bendin' like a tulip  
Blue-eyed and foolish  
Never mind the bruises  
Into the fire  
Breakin' through the wires  
Give you all I've got  
If I had a diamond heart  
I'd walk straight through the dagger  
Never break the pattern  
Diamonds don't shatter  
Beautiful and battered  
Into the poison  
Cry you an ocean  
Give you all I've got  
Steady is a stone  
I'd give you all my love  
If I was unbreakable  
Stone  
You could shoot me with a gun of gold  
If I was unbreakable  
I'd walk straight through the bullet  
Bendin' like a tulip  
Blue-eyed and foolish  
Never mind the bruises  
Into the fire  
Breakin' through the wires  
Give you all I've got  
If I had a diamond heart  
I'd walk straight through the dagger  
Never break the pattern  
Diamonds don't shatter  
Beautiful and battered  
Into the poison  
Cry you an ocean  
Give you all I've got
