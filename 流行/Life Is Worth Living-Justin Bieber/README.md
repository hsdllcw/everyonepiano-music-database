### Life Is Worth Living歌词：

Ended up on a crossroad  
Try to figure out which way to go  
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill  
Running in the same place  
You got your hazard lights on now  
Hoping that somebody would slow down  
Praying for a miracle  
Who'll show you grace?  
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas  
With a long journey ahead  
Seen a truck pull over  
God sent an angel to help you out  
He gave you direction  
Showed you how to read a map  
For that long journey ahead  
Said it ain't never over  
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living, ou ou ou ou  
Life is worth living, so live another day  
The meaning of forgiveness  
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in  
Life is worth living again

Relationship on a ski slope  
Avalanche comin' down slow  
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?  
Feels like a blizzard in April  
'Cause my heart is just that cold  
Skating on thin ice  
But it's strong enough to hold us up  
Seen her scream and holler  
Put us both on blast  
Tearing each other down  
When I thought it was over  
God sent an angel to help us out, yeah  
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last  
For that long journey ahead  
Said it ain't never over  
No, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living, ou ou ou ou  
Life is worth living, so live another day  
The meaning of forgiveness  
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in  
Life is worth living again, oh whoa oh  
Life is worth living again

What I get from my reflection  
Is a different perception  
From what the world may see  
They try to crucify me  
I ain't perfect, won't deny  
My reputation's on the line  
So I'm working on a better me

Life is worth living, oh yeah  
Life is worth living, so live another day  
The meaning of forgiveness  
People make mistakes  
Only God can judge me  
Life is worth living again  
Another day  
Life is worth living again
