**Peaches** 是Justin Bieber联手Daniel Caesar与Giveon一同合作的单曲。收录在第六张录音室专辑Justice中。

_Peaches_ 是一首以alternative
R&B音乐元素为主的POP。全曲以R&B贯穿始终，搭配电子合成器的细腻演绎使得整体节奏慵懒但不拖泥带水，柔和治愈，犹如与伴侣漫步于海风拂面的西海岸沙滩。开头看似松散的旋律，配合Justin沙哑男嗓犹如一封告白情书，甜蜜且大胆地诠释着爱与永恒。副歌Daniel柔滑细腻的浅吟低唱，犹如泉水般甘甜且丝滑，Giveon洒脱自信的深情吟唱，犹如白兰地酒般热烈且忘我，烘托出一种迷幻且宏大的氛围。结尾在Justin随心的演绎和细碎的乐器演奏中缓缓度过，犹如在西海岸沙滩放慢脚步停下休息。

### Peaches歌词：

I got my peaches out in Georgia  
Oh yeah s**t  
I get my w**d from California  
That's that s**t  
I took my chick up to the North yeah  
Bada*s b***h  
I get my light right from the source yeah  
Yeah that's it  
And I say oh  
Oh  
The way I breathe you in  
In  
It's the texture of your skin  
I want to wrap my arms around you babe and never let you go  
And I say oh  
There's nothing like your touch  
It's the way you lift me up  
Yeah and I'll be right here with you till the end  
I got my peaches out in Georgia  
Oh yeah s**t  
I get my w**d from California  
That's that s**t  
I took my chick up to the North yeah  
Bada*s b***h  
I get my light right from the source yeah  
Yeah that's it  
You ain't sure yet  
But I'm for ya  
All I can want  
All I can wish for  
Nights alone that we miss more  
And days we save as souvenirs  
There's no time I wanna make more time  
And give you my whole life  
I left my girl I'm in my Yorker  
Hate to leave her call it torture  
Remember when I couldn't hold her  
Left her baggage for a mover  
I got my peaches out in Georgia  
Oh yeah s**t  
I get my w**d from California  
That's that s**t  
I took my chick up to the North yeah  
Bada*s b***h  
I get my light right from the source yeah  
Yeah that's it  
I get the feeling so I'm sure  
Hand in my hand because I'm yours  
I can't I can't pretend  
I can't ignore you're right for me  
Don't think you want to know just where I've been no  
Don't be distracted  
The one I need is right in my arms  
Your kisses taste the sweetest with mine  
And I'll be right here with ya till end of time  
I got my peaches out in Georgia  
Oh yeah s**t  
I get my w**d from California  
That's that s**t  
I took my chick up to the North yeah  
Bada*s b***h  
I get my light right from the source yeah  
Yeah that's it  
I got my peaches out in Georgia  
Oh yeah s**t  
I get my w**d from California  
That's that s**t  
I took my chick up to the North yeah  
Bada*s b***h  
I get my light right from the source yeah  
Yeah  
I got my peaches out in Georgia  
Oh yeah s**t  
I get my w**d from California  
That's that s**t  
I took my chick up to the North yeah  
Bada*s b***h  
I get my light right from the source yeah
