### Bruises歌词：

Counting days counting days  
Since my love up and got lost on me  
And every breath that I've been taken  
Since you left feels like a waste on me  
I've been holding on to hope  
That you'll come back when you can find some peace  
Cause every word that I've heard spoken  
Since you left feels like an hollow street  
I've been told I've been told to get you off my mind  
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind  
Oh my lord oh my lord I need you by my side  
There must be something in the water  
Cause everyday it's getting colder  
And if only I could hold you  
You'd keep my head from going under  
Maybe  
I maybe I'm just being blinded  
By the brighter side  
Of what we had because it's over  
Well there must be something in the tide  
I've been told  
I've been told to get you off my mind  
But I hope I never lose the bruises  
That you left behind  
Oh my lord oh my lord  
I need you by my side  
There must be something in the water  
Cause everyday it's getting colder  
And if only I could hold you  
You'd keep my head from going under  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
It's your love I'm lost in  
Your love I'm lost in  
Your love I'm lost in  
And I'm tired of being so exhausted  
Your love I'm lost in  
Your love I'm lost in  
Your love I'm lost in  
Even though I'm nothing to you now  
Even though I'm nothing to you now  
There must be something in the water  
Cause everyday it's getting colder  
And if only I could hold you  
You'd keep my head from going under  
There must be something in the water  
Cause everyday it's getting colder  
And if only I could hold you  
You'd keep my head from going under
