### Like You Do歌词：

Lately I can't help but think that our roads might take us down different
phases  
Don't wanna complicate the rhythm that we've got  
But I'm speechless  
When everything's so pure  
Can it be aimless  
Painless  
If you ever go all the songs that we like  
Will sound like bittersweet lullabies  
Lost in the blue  
They don't love me like you do  
Those chills that I knew  
They were nothing without you  
And everyone else  
They don't matter now  
You're the one I can't lose  
No one loves me like you do  
Since I met you  
All the gloomy days just seem to shine a little more brightly  
Consider what we've got  
'Cause I could never take you for granted  
Is there another us on this whole planet planet  
If you ever go all the songs that we like  
Will sound like bittersweet lullabies  
Lost in the blue  
They don't love me like you do  
Those chills that I knew  
They were nothing without you  
And everyone else  
They don't matter now  
You're the one I can't lose  
No one loves me like you do  
No one loves me like you do  
I don't wanna seem foolish  
When I'm jumping into this  
You're all that I see  
Lost in the blue  
They don't love me like you do  
Those chills that I knew  
They were nothing without you  
And everyone else  
They don't matter now  
You're the one I can't lose  
No one loves me like you do
