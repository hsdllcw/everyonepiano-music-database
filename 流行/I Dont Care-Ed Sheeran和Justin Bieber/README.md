### I Don't Care歌词：

I'm at a party I don't wanna be at  
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie  
Wondering if I can sneak out of the back  
Nobody is even looking at me in my eyes  
And then you take my hand  
Finish my drink say shall we dance  
Hell yeah  
Y'know I love you did I ever tell you  
You make it better like that  
Don't think I fit in at this party  
Everyone's got so much to say  
I always feel like I'm nobody  
Who wants to fit in anyway  
Coz I don't care when I'm with my baby yeah  
All the bad things disappear  
And you making me feel that maybe I am somebody  
I can deal with the bad nights when I'm with my baby yeah  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Coz I don't care  
As long as you just hold me near  
You can take me anywhere  
And you making me feel like I'm loved by somebody  
I can deal with the bad nights when I'm with my baby yeah  
We at a party we don't wanna be at  
Trying to talk but we can't hear ourselves  
Read your lips I'd rather kiss 'em right back  
With all these people all around I'm crippled with anxiety  
But I'm told it's where I'm supposed to be  
You know what  
It's kind of crazy coz I really don't mind  
When you make it better like that  
Don't think we fit in at this party  
Everyone's got so much to say  
When we walked in I said I'm sorry  
But now I think that we should stay  
Coz I don't care when I'm with my baby yeah  
All the bad things disappear  
And you making me feel that maybe I am somebody  
I can deal with the bad nights when I'm with my baby yeah  
Ooh ooh ooh oh yeah yeah yeah  
Coz I don't care  
As long as you just hold me near  
You can take me anywhere  
And you making me feel like I'm loved by somebody  
I can deal with the bad nights when I'm with my baby yeah  
Oh oh oh oh no  
I don't like nobody but you  
It's like you're the only one here  
I don't like nobody but you baby I don't care  
I don't like nobody but you  
I hate everyone here  
I don't like nobody but you baby yeah  
Coz I don't care  
Don't care  
When I'm with my baby yeah  
Oh yeah  
All the bad things disappear  
Disappear  
And you making me feel that maybe I am somebody  
Maybe I'm somebody  
I can deal with the bad nights  
With the bad nights  
When I'm with my baby yeah  
Ooh ooh ooh oh yeah yeah yeah  
Coz I don't care  
As long as you just hold me near  
Me near  
You can take me anywhere  
Anywhere anywhere  
And you making me feel like I'm loved by somebody  
Loved by somebody yeah  
I can deal with the bad nights when I'm with my baby yeah  
Oh oh oh
