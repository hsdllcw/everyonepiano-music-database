### Joan of Arc歌词：

Hey hey  
Damn  
Leigh-Anne：  
One foot in the club everybody watch me  
One pop on the booty everybody love me  
Ain't the reason I'm cocky  
I make myself feel sexy  
Fanning myself I'm stanning myself  
I love me so much I put my hands on myself  
Fanning myself I'm stanning myself  
I love me so much I put my hands on myself  
Perrie with Jade Deep Voice：  
Man I feel like Cleopatra Joan Of Arc Queen of Hearts yeah  
Tonight it's only me that matters  
Oh you on that feminist tip  
Hell yeah I am  
Jesy：  
I don't need a man  
If I'm loving you it's 'cause I can  
I don't want your cash  
I put my own rock on my hand  
I put my own rock on my hand  
I put my own rock on my hand  
I don't need a man  
If I'm loving you it's 'cause I can  
Jade with Leigh-Anne：  
Make way for the G O double D E S S  
I spare no enemies in this dress  
Uh huh uh huh  
I make myself feel sexy  
Fanning myself I'm stanning myself  
I love me so much I put my hands on myself  
Fanning myself I'm stanning myself  
I love me so much can't keep my hands off myself  
Perrie with Jade Deep Voice：  
Man I feel like Cleopatra Joan Of Arc Queen of Hearts yeah  
Tonight it's only me that matters  
Oh you on that feminist tip  
Hell yeah I am  
Jade：  
I don't need a man  
If I'm loving you it's 'cause I can  
I don't want your cash  
I put my own rock on my hand  
I put my own rock on my hand  
I put my own rock on my hand  
I don't need a man  
If I'm loving you it's 'cause I can  
Jade/Leigh-Anne：  
Yeah one-one take control  
Drop your man down like you don't want him no more  
Say two-two freak the floor  
Drop it so low that your thighs get sore  
Say one-one take control  
Drop your man down like you don't want him no more  
Say two-two freak the floor  
Drop it so low that your thighs get sore  
Jesy Nelson/Leigh-Anne：  
I don't need a man  
If I'm loving you it's 'cause I can  
I don't want your cash  
I put my own rock on my hand  
I put my own rock on my hand  
I put my own rock on my hand  
I don't need a man  
If I'm loving you it's 'cause I can  
I don't need a man  
If I'm loving you it's 'cause I can  
I don't want your cash  
I put my own rock on my hand  
I put my own rock on my hand  
I put my own rock on my hand  
I don't need a man  
If I'm loving you it's 'cause I can
