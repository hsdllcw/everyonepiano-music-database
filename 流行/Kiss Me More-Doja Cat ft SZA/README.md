### Kiss Me More歌词：

Doja Cat：  
We hug and yes we make love  
And always just say "Goodnight"  
La-la-la la-la-la  
And we cuddle sure I do love it  
But I need your lips on mine  
Can you kiss me more  
We're so young boy we ain't got nothin' to lose uh-oh  
It's just principle  
Baby hold me 'cause I like the way we move uh-oh  
Boy you write your name I can do the same  
Oh I love the taste la-la-la la-la  
All on my tongue I want it  
La-la-la la-la  
Boy you write your name I can do the same  
Oh I love the taste la-la-la la-la  
All on my tongue I want it  
La-la-la la-la  
I I feel like f**king something  
But we could be corny f**k it  
Sugar I ain't no dummy-dummy  
I like to say "What if" but if  
We could kiss and just cut the rubbish  
Then I might be on to somethin'  
I ain't givin' you one in public  
I'm givin' you hundreds f**k it  
Somethin' we just gotta get into  
Sign first middle last on the wisdom tooth  
N***as wishin' that the p***y was a kissin' booth  
Taste breakfast lunch and gin and juice  
And that dinner just like dessert too  
And when we French refresh gimme two  
When I bite that lip come get me too  
He want lipstick lip-gloss hickeys too huh  
Can you kiss me more  
We're so young boy we ain't got nothin' to lose uh-oh  
It's just principle  
Baby hold me 'cause I like the way we move uh-oh  
Boy you write your name I can do the same  
Oh I love the taste la-la-la la-la  
All on my tongue I want it  
La-la-la la-la  
Boy you write your name I can do the same  
Oh I love the taste la-la-la la-la  
All on my tongue I want it  
La-la-la la-la  
SZA：  
Say give me a buck need that gushy stuff  
Push the limit no you ain't good enough  
All your n***as say that you lost without me  
All my b***hes feel like I dodged the county  
F**kin' with you feel like jail n***a  
I can't even exhale n***a  
P***y like holy grail you know that  
You gon' make me need bail you know that  
Caught dippin' with your friend  
You ain't even half man lyin' on your you know that  
Got me a bag full of brick you know that  
Control don't slow the pace if I throw back  
All this a*s for real  
Ahh  
Drama make you feel  
Ahh  
Fantasy and whip appeal  
Is all I can give you  
Doja Cat/SZA：  
Can you kiss me more  
We're so young boy we ain't got nothin' to lose uh-oh  
It's just principle  
Baby hold me 'cause I like the way we move uh-oh  
Oh darlin'  
Boy you write your name I can do the same  
Ooh I love the taste oh-la-la-la-la-la  
All on my tongue I want it  
Boy you write your name I can do the same  
Ooh I love the taste oh-la-la-la-la-la  
All on my tongue I want it
