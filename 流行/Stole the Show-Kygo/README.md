### Stole the Show歌词：

Darling, darling, oh, turn the lights back on now  
Watching, watching, as the credits all roll down  
Crying, crying, you know we're playing to a full house, house

No heroes, villains, one to blame  
While wilted roses filled the stage  
And the thrill, the thrill is gone  
Our debut was a masterpiece  
But in the end for you and me  
Oh, the show, it can't go on

We used to have it all, but now's our curtain call  
So hold for the applause, oh  
And wave out to the crowd, and take our final bow  
Oh, it's our time to go, but at least we stole the show  
Least we stole the show  
Least we stole the show  
Least we stole the show  
Least we stole the show

Least we stole the show

Darling, darling, you know that we are sold out  
Kisses fading, but the band plays on now  
We're crying, crying, so let the velvet roll down, down

No heroes, villains, one to blame  
While wilted roses fill the stage  
And the thrill, the thrill is gone  
Our debut was a masterpiece  
Our lines we read so perfectly  
But the show, it can't go on

We used to have it all, but now's our curtain call  
So hold for the applause, oh  
And wave out to the crowd, and take our final bow  
Oh, it's our time to go, but at least we stole the show  
Least we stole the show  
Least we stole the show  
Least we stole the show  
Stole the show  
Least we stole the show  
Stole the show  
Least we stole the show
