**Let Her Go** 这首歌曲来自英国民谣创作歌手Passenger的第三张专辑《All The Little
Lights》。他用独特的嗓音低吟浅唱出一个人失去所爱之后的心情。

主唱独特的声音和歌词曲调很搭，是歌亦是诗。歌者自带伤感的嗓音，适合每一个正因失恋而痛苦中的，也适合人生正处于低谷的人，也适合在远方的游子，在诉说，也在劝解。更像是自己对自己的一种安慰。适合每个人，每个用心的人！

### Let Her Go歌词：

Well you only need the light when it's burning low  
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow  
Only know you love her when you let her go  
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low  
Only hate the road when you're missing home  
Only know you love her when you let her go  
And you let her go  
Staring at the bottom of your glass  
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last  
But dreams come slow and they go so fast  
You see her when you close your eyes  
Maybe one day you'll understand why  
Everything you touch surely dies  
But you only need the light when it's burning low  
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow  
Only know you love her when you let her go  
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low  
Only hate the road when you're missing home  
Only know you love her when you let her go  
Staring at the ceiling in the dark  
Same old empty feeling in your heart  
Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast  
Well you see her when you fall asleep  
But never to touch and never to keep  
Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep  
Well you only need the light when it's burning low  
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow  
Only know you love her when you let her go  
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low  
Only hate the road when you're missing home  
Only know you love her when you let her go  
And you let her go  
And you let her go  
Well you let her go  
Cause you only need the light when it's burning low  
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow  
Only know you love her when you let her go  
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low  
Only hate the road when you're missing home  
Only know you love her when you let her go  
Cause you only need the light when it's burning low  
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow  
Only know you love her when you let her go  
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low  
Only hate the road when you're missing home  
Only know you love her when you let her go  
And you let her go
