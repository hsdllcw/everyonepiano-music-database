### Heat Waves歌词：

Last night all I think about is you  
Don't stop baby you can walk through  
Don't wanna but I think about you  
You know that I'm never gonna do  
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision  
Heat heat waves I'm swimmin' in a mirror  
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision  
Heat heat waves I'm swimmin' in a  
Sometimes all I think about is you  
Late nights in the middle of June  
Heat waves been fakin' me out  
Can't make you happier now  
Sometimes all I think about is you  
Late nights in the middle of June  
Heat waves been fakin' me out  
Can't make you happier now  
Usually I put somethin' on TV  
So we never think about you and me  
But today I see our reflections clearly  
In Hollywood layin' on the screen  
You just need a better life than this  
You need somethin' I can never give  
Fake water all across the road  
It's gone now the night has come but  
Sometimes all I think about is you  
Late nights in the middle of June  
Heat waves been fakin' me out  
Can't make you happier now  
You can't fight it you can't breathe  
You say somethin' so lovin' but  
Now I gotta let you go  
You'll be better off in someone new  
I don't wanna be alone  
You know it hurts me too  
You look so broken when you cry  
One more and then I say goodbye  
Sometimes all I think about is you  
Late nights in the middle of June  
Heat waves been fakin' me out  
Can't make you happier now  
Sometimes all I think about is you  
Late nights in the middle of June  
Heat waves been fakin' me out  
Can't make you happier now  
I just wanna know what you're dreamin' of  
When you sleep and smile so comfortable  
I just wish that I could give you that  
That look that's perfectly un-sad  
Sometimes all I think about is you  
Late nights in the middle of June  
Heat waves been fakin' me out  
Heat waves been fakin' me out  
Sometimes all I think about is you  
Late nights in the middle of June  
Heat waves been fakin' me out  
Can't make you happier now  
Sometimes all I think about is you  
Late nights in the middle of June  
Heat waves been fakin' me out  
Can't make you happier now  
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision  
Heat heat waves I'm swimmin' in a mirror  
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision  
Heat heat waves I'm swimmin' in a mirror
