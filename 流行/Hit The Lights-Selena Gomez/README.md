### Hit the Lights歌词:

It's the boy you never told I like you,  
It's the girl you let get away.  
It's the one you saw that day on the train,  
But you freaked out and walked away.

It's the plane you wanna catch to Vegas,  
Things you swear you'll do before you die,  
It's the city of love that waits for you,  
But you're to damn scared to fly.

Hit the lights, let the music move you, lose yourself tonight,  
Come alive, let the moment take you, lose control tonight.  
Hit the lights, let the music move you, lose yourself tonight,  
Come alive, let the moment take you, lose control tonight.

It's the time that you totally screwed up,  
Still you're trying to get it out your brain.  
It's the fight you had when you didn't make up,  
It's the past that you're dying to change.  
It's all the money that you're saving,  
While the good life passes by.  
It's all the dreams that never came true,  
Cause you're too damn scared to try. (Scared to try.)

Hit the lights, let the music move you, lose yourself tonight,  
Come alive, let the moment take you, lose control tonight.  
Hit the lights, let the music move you, lose yourself tonight,  
Come alive, let the moment take you, lose control tonight.

It's a mad, mad world, gotta make an escape,  
It's a perfect world, when you go all the way.  
Hit the lights, let the music move you, lose yourself tonight.

So let's go, go, go, go all the way.  
Yeah let's go, go, go, go night and day.  
From the floor, to the rafters, people raise your glasses,  
We could dance forever!

Hit the lights, let the music move you, lose yourself tonight,  
Come alive, let the moment take you, lose control tonight.  
It's a mad, mad world, gotta make an escape.  
It's a perfect world, when you go all the way.  
Hit the lights, let the music move you, lose yourself tonight.
