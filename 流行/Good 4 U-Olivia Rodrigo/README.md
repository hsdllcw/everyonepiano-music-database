### Good 4 U歌词：

Well good for you I guess you moved on really easily  
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks  
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world  
And good for you I guess that you've been working on yourself  
I guess that therapist I found for you she really helped  
Now you can be a better man for your brand new girl  
Well good for you  
You look happy and healthy not me  
If you ever cared to ask  
Good for you  
You're doing great out there without me baby  
God I wish that I could do that  
I've lost my mind  
I've spent the night  
Crying on the floor of my bathroom  
But you're so unaffected I really don't get it  
But I guess good for you  
Well good for you I guess you're getting everything you want  
You bought a new car and your career's really taking off  
It's like we never even happened baby  
What the f**k is up with that  
And good for you it's like you never even met me  
Remember when you swore to God I was the only  
Person who ever got you  
Well screw that and screw you  
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do  
Well good for you  
You look happy and healthy not me  
If you ever cared to ask  
Good for you  
You're doing great out there without me baby  
God I wish that I could do that  
I've lost my mind  
I've spent the night  
Crying on the floor of my bathroom  
But you're so unaffected I really don't get it  
But I guess good for you  
Maybe I'm too emotional  
But your apathy's like a wound in salt  
Maybe I'm too emotional  
Or maybe you never cared at all  
Maybe I'm too emotional  
Your apathy's like a wound in salt  
Maybe I'm too emotional  
Or maybe you never cared at all  
Well good for you  
You look happy and healthy not me  
If you ever cared to ask  
Good for you  
You're doing great out there without me baby  
Like a d**n sociopath  
I've lost my mind  
I've spent the night  
Crying on the floor of my bathroom  
But you're so unaffected I really don't get it  
But I guess good for you  
Well good for you I guess you moved on really easily
