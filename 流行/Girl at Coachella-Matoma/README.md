### Girl at Coachella歌词：

I thought I met the one  
She had everything I wanted  
A beauty in the sun  
And we like the same bands  
We danced, we laughed, we took a couple things  
We screamed, we clapped, like kids in the rain  
The time we had was something from a dream  
'Til reality kicked in  
And she said, she said she'd run away with me  
So I took her to the VIP  
And when the lights went on, she was gone forever  
Never trust a girl at Coachella  
She said she was the one for me  
She was kissing me from cheek to cheek  
But when the lights went on, she was gone forever  
Never trust a girl at Coachella  
I met another one (I met another one)  
Standing in a sundress  
She was innocent at first (She was innocent at first)  
Introduced me to her girlfriends  
We danced, we laughed, with water in our hands  
We screamed, we clapped, like kids in the sand  
She restored my faith in the human race  
'Til reality kicked in  
And she said  
She said she'd run away with me  
So I took her to the VIP  
And when the lights went on, she was gone forever  
Never trust a girl at Coachella  
She said she was the one for me  
She was kissing me from cheek to cheek  
But when the lights went on, she was gone forever  
(She was gone, gone, gone, gone)  
Never trust a girl at Coachella  
I'm still trippin' off a devious plan  
I was trippin' off the shrooms  
She was trippin' for a band  
She took notice of some fans  
And stopped for pics, 'cause I'm the man  
She jumped over on my dick  
'Cause she just realized who I am  
Got her past the gate, actin' like my date  
Soon as she got in, started actin' fake  
She ain't wanna stay close to me  
Even though she was just blowin' me  
Blowin' in the wind, bus to bus  
Member to member, all for lust  
Lead singer to the man on the drums  
Slow in her waist but as fast as they come  
She said she'd run away with me  
So I took her to the VIP  
And when the lights went on, she was gone forever (she was gone)  
Never trust a girl at Coachella  
She said she was the one for me  
She was kissing me from cheek to cheek  
But when the lights went on, she was gone forever (she was gone)  
Never trust a girl at Coachella  
She was gone  
(Run away with me)  
She was gone  
VIP  
When the Lights went on, she was gone forever  
Never trust a girl at Coachella  
Never trust a girl at Coachella
