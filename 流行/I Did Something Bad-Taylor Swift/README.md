### I Did Something Bad歌词：

I never trust a narcissist  
But they love me  
So I play 'em like a violin  
And I make it look oh so easy  
'Cause for every lie I tell them  
They tell me three  
This is how the world works  
Now all he thinks about is me  
I can feel the flames on my skin  
Crimson red paint on my lips  
If a man talks sh*t then I owe him nothing  
I don't regret it one bit 'cause he had it coming  
They say I did something bad ah  
Then why's it feel so good  
They say I did something bad ah  
But why's it feel so good  
Most fun I ever had ah  
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could  
It just felt so good good  
Ra ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta death trap  
Ra ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta death trap  
Ra ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta death trap  
Death trap trap trap  
I never trust a playboy  
But they love me  
So I fly 'em all around the world  
And I let them think they saved me  
They never see it comin'  
What I do next  
This is how the world works  
You gotta leave before you get left  
I can feel the flames on my skin  
He says don't throw away a good thing  
But if he drops my name then I owe him nothin'  
And if he spends my change then he had it comin'  
They say I did something bad ah  
Then why's it feel so good  
They say I did something bad ah  
But why's it feel so good  
Most fun I ever had ah  
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could  
It just felt so good good  
Ra ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta death trap  
Ra ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta death trap  
It just felt so good  
Ra ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta death trap  
Death trap trap trap  
They're burning all the witches even if you aren't one  
They got their pitchforks and proof  
Their receipts and reasons  
They're burning all the witches even if you aren't one  
So light me up light me up light me up light me up  
Light me up go ahead and light me up light me up  
Light me up light me up light me up light me up  
Light me up light me up light me up  
They say I did something bad ah oh  
Then why's it feel so good so good  
They say I did something bad ah  
But why's it feel so good  
Most fun I ever had  
Most fun I ever had  
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could  
It just felt so good good good  
Ra ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta death trap  
Ra ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta death trap  
Oh you say I did something bad ah  
Then why's it feel so good good  
So bad why's it feel so good  
Why's it feel why's it feel so good bad  
It just felt so good good
