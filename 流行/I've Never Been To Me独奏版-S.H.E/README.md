《 **I've Never Been To Me** 》是由hirsch,ken miller,ronald
作词作曲，S.H.E.演唱的一首歌曲，收录在专辑《青春株式会社》中。这是一首流行风格的歌曲，歌曲展现了S.H.E.优美的和声及各自的唱腔特色。

  

《 _I've Never Been To Me_ 》，中文常译作《未曾有过自我》。是由素有“蓝调女王”之称的美国歌星夏琳·邓肯（charlene
duncan）的代表作。

  

《I've Never Been To
Me》是一首充满女性自觉的抒情歌曲。歌曲的叙述方式十分特别：描述一个历经沧桑的女人，见到一个因不满自己目下的生活、准备去追寻“自由”的怨妇，忍不住真挚地提出忠告“我自己也曾经有过放荡形骸的生活，甚至为追寻所谓的自由走遍了世界；而且凭借年轻和美貌，曾得到过别的女人做梦都不敢想的快乐时光；但是到头来却是一场空，等到年纪大了，发现自己追求的不过是镜花水月，甚至从未有过真正的自我”。

  

由于优美的曲调，歌曲得到了世界众多歌手的翻唱。在2002年青春少女组合S.H.E也翻唱了该曲。且S.H.E的版本明显稚嫩了很多。

### I've Never Been To Me歌词：

演唱：S.H.E

  

Hey lady,you lady  
Cursin' at your life  
You're a discontened mother  
And a regimented wife  
I've no doubt you dream about  
The thinds you'll never do  
But I wish someone had to talked to me  
Like I wanna talk to you  
I've been to Georgia and California  
And anywhere I could run  
Took the head of a preacher man  
And we made love in the sun  
But I ran out of places and friendly faces  
Because I had to be free  
I've been to paradise  
But I've never been to me

Please lady,please lady  
Don't just walk away  
'Cause I have this need to tell you  
Why I'm alone today  
Ican see so much of me  
Still living in your eyes  
Won't you share a part of a weary heart  
That has lived million lies  
Oh I've been to Nice and the Isle of Greece  
While I sipped champagne on a yacht  
I moved like harlot in Monte Carlo  
And showed'em what I've got  
I've been undressed by kings  
And I've seen some things  
That a woman ain't supposed to see,  
Hey Lady I've been to paradise  
But I 've never been to me

Sometimes I've been to cryin'  
For unborn children  
That might have made me complete  
But I,I took the sweet life  
And never knew  
I'd bitter from the sweet  
I spent my life exploring the subtle whoring  
That cost too much to be free Hey lady,  
I've been to paradise (I've been to paradise)  
but I've never been to me

I've been to paradise  
but I've never been to me
