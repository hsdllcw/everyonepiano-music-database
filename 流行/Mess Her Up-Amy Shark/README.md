### Mess Her Up歌词：

It's the little white lies  
That keep us awake  
It's the long drive home that makes people talk  
It's the fear in our hearts that give us away  
It's the playful fight in a swimming pool  
I still think of you  
Alright I'm ready to shake things up  
Dear god this is really gonna mess her up  
And I keep on praying that I'm strong enough  
It's a lot for love it's a lot for love  
It's the brush of my hand in a wide hallway  
It's the long goodbyes that give us away  
It's the song that comes on and it hurts the most  
It's the kiss in the car and you hate yourself  
But the high notes get the best of you  
Alright I'm ready to shake things up  
Dear god this is really gonna mess her up  
And I keep on praying that I'm strong enough  
It's a lot for love it's a lot for love  
Alright I'm ready to shake things up  
Dear god this is really gonna mess her up  
And I keep on praying that I'm strong enough  
It's a lot for love it's a lot for love  
Some say that we'll be over before we've begun  
And I can't let it be over  
I gotta have one  
Listen to you love like crazy  
Time should make this easy  
Alright  
Alright I'm ready to shake things up  
Dear god this is really gonna mess her up  
And I keep on praying that I'm strong enough  
It's a lot for love it's a lot for love  
Alright I'm ready to shake things up  
Dear god this is really gonna mess her up  
And I keep on praying that I'm strong enough  
It's a lot for love it's a lot for love  
It's a lot for love  
This is really gonna this is really gonna mess her up  
This is really gonna mess her up
