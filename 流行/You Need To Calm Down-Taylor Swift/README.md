### You Need To Calm Down歌词：

You are somebody that I don't know  
But you're taking shots at me  
Like it's Patrón  
And I'm just like d**n  
It's 7 am  
Say it in the street that's a knock out  
But you say it in a tweet that's a cop out  
And I'm just like hey  
Are you ok  
And I ain't trying to mess with your self-expression  
But I've learned the lesson that  
Stressin' and obsessing 'bout somebody else is no fun  
And snakes and stones never broke my bones so  
Ohhhhh  
You need to calm down  
You're being too loud  
And I'm just like  
Ohhhhh  
You need to just stop  
Like can you just not  
Step on my gown  
You need to calm down  
You are somebody that we don't know  
But you're coming at my friends like a missile  
Why are you mad  
When you could be GLAAD  
Sunshine on the street at the parade  
But you would rather be in the dark ages  
Making that sign  
Must've taken all night  
You just need to take several seats  
And then try to restore the peace  
And control your urges to scream  
About all the people you hate  
Cause shade never made anybody less gay so  
Ohhhhh  
You need to calm down  
You're being too loud  
And I'm just like  
Ohhhhh  
You need to just stop  
Like can you just not  
Step on his gown  
You need to calm down  
And we see you over there on the internet  
Comparing all the girls who are killing it  
But we figured you out  
We all know now  
We all got crowns  
You need to calm down  
Ohhhhh  
You need to calm down  
You need to calm down  
You're being too loud  
You're being too loud  
And I'm just like  
Ohhhhh  
You need to just stop  
Can you stop  
Like can you just not  
Step on our gowns  
You need to calm down
