### Happy歌词：

Couldn't relax, couldn't sit back  
And let the sunlight in my lap  
I sang a hymn to bring me peace  
And then it came, a melody

It felt so sweet, it felt so strong  
It made me feel like I belonged  
And all the sadness inside me  
Melted away like I was free

I found what I'd been looking for in myself  
Found a life worth living for someone else  
Never thought that I could be, I could be  
Happy, happy

Don't go out much at all  
I've never been the type to call  
I realize to be happy  
Maybe I need a little company

So now you know, you know it all  
That I've been des-desperately alone  
I haven't found the one for me  
But I believe in divinity

I found what I'd been looking for in myself  
Found a life worth living for someone else  
Never thought that I could be, I could be  
Happy, happy

I believe in possibility  
I believe someone's watching over me  
And finally I have found a way to be  
Happy, happy

From the concrete to the coast  
I was looking for a holy ghost  
Like the land joining the sea  
Happiness, it followed me

I believe in possibility  
I believe someone's watching over me  
And finally I have found a way to be  
Happy, happy, happy
