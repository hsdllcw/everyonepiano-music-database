### Whats Poppin歌词：

What's poppin'  
Pooh you a fool for this one  
Brand new whip just hopped in  
Just hopped in  
I got options  
Oh Lord Jetson made another one  
I could pass that b***h like Stockton  
It ain't nothin'  
Just joshin'  
I'ma spend this holiday locked in  
Ooh  
My body got rid of them toxins  
Mmh mmh  
SportsCenter top ten  
I could put the ball in the end zone  
Put a bad b***h in the friendzone ooh  
This s**t sound like an intro Jetson  
Give me that tempo ooh  
Told Pooh he a fool with this s**t  
He a fool  
Told her don't let her friends know  
Don't  
In the 'Ville and I move like a don  
Don  
Eating fettuccine at Vincenzo's  
Me and my 'migos got that free smoke  
On the West Coast yeah  
I'm talking 'bout pre-rolls  
Pre-roll  
Dark haired b***h and she look like Shego  
She do  
Hometown hero feeling myself  
Can't murder my ego  
Can't do it  
She heard of my deep stroke  
She said "Babe does it hurt when I deep throat"  
It does  
Certified freak ho  
Hang around us and she learnin' my lingo  
Back then wasn't worried 'bout me though  
In the gym tryna work on my free throw  
Godd**n  
Spending money at the club like Sam's  
Cha-ching  
Yes ma'am  
She a lil' freak on cam  
But she don't put this on the 'Gram  
Nah  
Lil' boys tryna diss on the 'Gram  
Ayy  
I can't switch on the fam  
B***h  
S**t's hot hit the switch on the fan  
Hit that s**t  
This where my head is  
Listen  
I feel resentment from every direction  
Even some homies be wearing expressions  
I be discouraged from sharing my blessings  
D**n  
We used to share a connection  
Now it just feels like it's wearing and stretching  
I'm getting real sick of taking advice  
From people that never could stare at reflections  
Ooh  
Somewhere in there is a lesson  
Y'all ain't evolvin' it's very depressing  
I'm at the club with the basketball team  
Me and the Cardinals are sharing a section  
Facts  
Gotta cherish the present  
I'm drinking water and wearing protection  
Got a career and I'm very invested  
Some people call it a scary obsession  
Ooh period but  
I like to call it a passion I can't be sitting relaxin'  
Nah I can't  
PG we getting some traction  
I'm at the venue  
It's packed in  
Packed out  
I'm digging her accent  
I got a B B Simon belt on me  
And she tryna get it unfastened  
That's my type of distraction  
That's my type and she Latin  
That's facts ooh  
Got my own flow and I'm 'bout to get a patent  
Brand new sheets for the bed they satin  
Soft real soft  
Y'all wasn't tuned in back then  
Nah  
My swag they keep jackin'  
Keep on jackin'  
I ain't doin' no verse quit askin'  
Quit askin'  
What's poppin'  
Pooh you a fool for this one  
Brand new whip just hopped in  
Just hopped in  
I got options  
I could pass that b***h like Stockton  
It ain't nothin'  
Just joshin'  
I'ma spend this holiday locked in  
Ooh  
My body got rid of them toxins  
Mmh mmh  
SportsCenter top ten
