### When You're Gone歌词：

You never know how good you have it oh  
Until you're starin' at a picture of the only girl that matters huh uh  
I know what we're supposed to do  
It's hard for me to let go of you  
So I'm just tryna hold on hold on  
I don't wanna know what it's like when you're gone  
I don't wanna move on  
I don't wanna know what it's like when you're gone for good  
You're slipping through my fingertips  
A little bit by a little bit  
I didn't know that loving you was the happiest I've ever been  
So I'm just tryna hold on  
I need to learn how to cope without you  
I'm tryna protect myself but only you know how to yeah  
Ooh I know what we're supposed to do  
Ooh but I hate the thought of losing you  
So I'm just tryna hold on hold on  
I don't wanna know what it's like when you're gone  
I don't wanna move on  
I don't wanna know what it's like when you're gone for good  
You're slipping through my fingertips  
A little bit by a little bit  
I didn't know that loving you was the happiest I've ever been  
So I'm just tryna hold on  
Starting to feel like you don't need me  
Wanna believe it's all for the better  
It's gettin' real I'm missing you deeply  
So I'm just tryna hold on  
Starting to feel like you don't need me  
Wanna believe it's all for the better  
It's gettin' real I'm missing you deeply  
So I'm just tryna hold on hold on  
I don't wanna know what it's like when you're gone  
I don't wanna move on  
I don't wanna know what it's like when you're gone for good  
You're slipping through my fingertips  
A little bit by a little bit  
I didn't know that loving you was the happiest I've ever been  
So I'm just tryna hold on  
I'm just trying to move on
