### Heartburn歌词：

Yea. Come on. Timbo! A. Keys,  
Let's go!  
Let me tell you something  
Tell you how I feel  
When he comes around  
I get to feelin ill  
It's a achy feelin inside my chest  
It's like I'm going into cardiac arrest

[CHORUS:]  
Adrenaline rushing in my body  
All my power I just can't fight it  
No matter how I keep on tryin'  
I can't deny I got this...heartburn [repeat under]  
Burnin in my soul  
Call the fire department  
It's out of control

Got me trippin', slippin', getting' beside myself  
I tried some medication but don't nothin help  
So I said "Docta, Docta, tell me will I die?"  
And he said, "Count to 5 Alicia"  
And I'm goin to be all right, Let's go! 1,2,3,4

[CHORUS:]  
Adrenaline rushing in my body  
All my power I just can't fight it  
No matter how I keep on tryin  
I can't deny I got this...heartburn [repeat under]  
Burnin in my soul  
Call the fire department  
It's out of control

Tastes so good I can't resist  
Getting harder to digest  
Can't take no more  
Gotta shake it off, and break it down  
And take it to the ground with me now  
Everybody say OOOOHHHH...  
Don't you know I got this...heartburn [repeat under]  
Burnin in my soul  
Call the fire department  
It's out of control  
What you tryin' to do?  
Heartburn [repeat under]  
Burnin in my soul  
Call the fire department  
It's out of control

Shake it Shake it Shake it off...go head girl  
Shake it Shake it Shake it off...oohoohooh  
Shake it Shake it Shake it off...go head girl  
Shake it Shake it Shake it off...oohoohooh  
Go head girl  
Oohoohooh
