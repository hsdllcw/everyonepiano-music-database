**Hangover**
是2014年6月9日下午13时（韩国时间），韩国歌手PSY新曲。通过美国iTunes正式公开，截至10日上午6时（韩国时间）已进入12个国家iTunes排行榜Top100。在美国则排名第163位，英国第221位。虽然成绩已然不错，但仍不及当年的《江南Style》和《Gentlemen》。

  
新曲《 _HANGOVER_ 》与美国HIP-POP歌手SNOOPDOGG合作，是一首突出说唱风格的十分上口的HIP-
POP歌曲。以韩国饮酒文化为素材的该歌曲以英文歌词为主，中间穿插了几句十分有韩国特色的歌词作为亮点。

  
MV中，桑拿浴、便利店、理发店、台球厅、路边摊、游乐场、练歌房等充满韩国元素的场景，以及炸弹酒等韩国特有的文化十分吸引眼球。

### Hangover歌词：

Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over (bend over)  
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over (bend over)  
Party's over, it ain't over  
Try to make a bad memory over and over  
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over (bend over)  
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over (bend over)  
Party's over, it ain't over  
Can I find a single piece of me? Game over

Hangover  
Hangover  
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over  
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over (bend over)  
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over  
Can I find a single piece of me? Game over

Drink 'till you're drunk  
Smoke like a broke stove  
Don't quit, take flight  
I can't remember last night  
It's aight, this the life of a superstar  
Sci-fi with that boy trooping hard, couping cars  
Snoop go hard in the paint  
Drink another cup until I fall flat  
All lead and then some  
1-5-1, done dilly  
Really for sure that  
I'm throw back intoxicated Change over, game over, hangover, faded  
Body shed, miss  
대체 어디있으  
꽤꼬리 못찾겠으

Eenie minee moe catch a lady by a toe  
안 예쁘면 예뻐 보일 때까지 빠라삐리뽀

Drink it up and get sick  
Bottom's up, get wasted  
Pour it up, drink it up, live it up, give it up  
Oh my God, dammit, there's the f*cking limit  
Pour it up, drink it up, live it up, give it up  
(받으시오)  
But I can't stop Making bottles pop until the wheels fall off  
(받으시오)  
And I can't quit  
I wake up in the morning do the same sh*t  
Wake up in the morning do the same sh*t

Hangover  
Hangover  
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over  
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over (bend over)  
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over  
Can I find a single piece of me? Game over

Waking and baking, shaking the flees  
Caking and baking, raking the cheese  
Early in the morning in the bathroom  
On my knees tipping and dripping, flipping the flow  
Whipping and dripping a drink on the floor  
This is the only way that I was taught a long time ago  
Seoul, Korea, you'll see a G-a like me-a  
Never would there ever be another like he-a  
G-A-N-G-S-T-A, nothing left to say  
I done smoked my whole day

Baby 나르 시험해  
어서 나를 시험해  
거시기가 거시기하니 거시기하고  
싹 다 거시기해 내일은 없다  
에라이 모르겠다 내 배를 째라  
내일의 나는 오늘의 너를 백프로 몰라

Drink it up and get sick  
Bottom's up, get wasted  
Pour it up, drink it up, live it up, give it up  
Oh my God, dammit, there's the fucking limit  
Pour it up, drink it up, live it up, give it up  
받으시오  
But I can't stop  
Making bottles pop until the wheels fall off  
받으시오  
And I can't quit  
I wake up in the morning do the same shit

Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over (bend over)  
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over (bend over)  
Party's over, it ain't over  
Try to make a bad memory over and over  
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over (bend over)  
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over (bend over)  
Party's over, it ain't over  
Can I find a single piece of me? Game over
