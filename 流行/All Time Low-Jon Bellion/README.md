### All Time Low歌词：

I was the knight in shining armour in your movie  
Would put your lips on mine and love the aftertaste  
Now I'm a ghost, I call your name, you look right through me  
You're the reason I'm alone and masturbate  
I (I, I), I've been trying to fix my pride  
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken  
Lie (lie, lie), lie, l-lie, I try to hide  
But now you know it  
That I'm at an all time  
[x4:]  
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low  
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low  
I was the prototype like 3 stacks on that CD  
An example of the perfect candidate  
Now all your girlfriends say that you don't want to see me  
You're the reason that I just can't concentrate  
I (Oh! I, I, I...) I've been trying to fix my pride  
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken  
Lie (lie, lie), lie, l-lie, I try to hide  
But now you know it  
That I'm at an all time  
[x4:]  
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low  
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low  
I (I, I), I've been trying to fix my pride  
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken  
Lie (lie, lie), lie, l-lie, I try to hide  
But now you know it  
That I'm at an all time  
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low  
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low  
Lie, l-lie, I try to hide  
But now you know it  
That I'm at an all time  
Hey!  
[x4:]  
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low  
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
