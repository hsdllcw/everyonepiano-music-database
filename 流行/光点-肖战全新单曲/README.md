### 光点歌词：

相信自己的直觉  
从未曾改变  
最初的那张脸  
经历多少次更迭  
太多无法预言  
安静跨越  
迎接未来不管多遥远  
用特写放大着每一天  
每一刻都要燃烧沸点  
That we've got one life one world  
So let's come together  
We'll weather the storm  
A rain of colors Look up to the sky  
We're all made of shooting stars  
We are made to love WOO OH  
We are made to love WOO OH  
We are made to love WOO OH  
We are made to love  
We are made to love  
散落着的彩笔 空白的画面  
依旧在那边  
Then I would  
Oh yes I would  
用笔描绘现实与回忆的关联  
Then I would  
Trust me I would  
有过超越极限的瞬间  
经历过自己的改变  
走过的痕迹变成光点  
That we've got one life one world  
So let's come together  
We'll weather the storm  
A rain of colors Look up to the sky  
We're all made of shooting stars  
We are made to love WOO OH  
We are made to love WOO OH  
We are made to love WOO OH  
We are made to love  
We are made to love  
生命 渺小不可思议  
生活 绝不轻易放弃  
眺望 做最真的自己 OH YEAH  
明天 无论是雨或晴  
拥抱 让爱更有意义  
世界 带着爱去前进 OH  
Cause we've got one life one world  
So let's come together  
We'll weather the storm  
A rain of colors Look up to the sky  
We're all made of shooting stars  
We are made to love WOO OH  
We are made to love WOO OH  
We are made to love WOO OH  
We are made to love  
We are made to love  
We are made to love
