**Someone to Watch Over Me** 是美国著名作曲家 George
Gershwin的曲子。乔治•格什温（GeorgeGershwin,1898－1937），写过大量的流行歌曲和数十部歌舞表演、音乐剧，是百老汇舞台和好莱坞的名作曲家。1924年为保尔•怀特曼的爵士音乐会写了《蓝色狂想曲》获得巨大成功。格什温的卓越贡献是把德彪西和拉赫马尼诺夫的风格与美国的爵士乐风格结合了起来，虽缺乏熟练的写作技巧，却是个了不起的旋律天才。

### Someone to Watch Over Me歌词：

There's a saying old says that love is blind  
Still we're often told "seek and ye shall find"  
So I'm going to seek a certain girl/lad I've had in mind  
Looking everywhere, haven't found her yet  
She's the big affair I cannot forget  
Only girl/man I ever think of will regret

I'd like to add her/him initials to my monogram  
Tell me where's the shepherd for this lost lamb

There's a somebody I'm longing to see  
I hope that she/he turns out to be  
Someone to watch over me

I'm a little lamb who's lost in a wood  
I know I could always be good  
To one who'll watch over me

Although I/he may not be the man some girls think of  
As handsome to my heart  
She/he carries the key

Won't you tell her/him please to put on some speed  
Follow my lead, oh how I need  
Someone to watch over me  
Someone to watch over me
