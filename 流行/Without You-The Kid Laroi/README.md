### Without You歌词：

You cut out a piece of me and now I bleed internally  
Left here without you  
No no no  
Without you  
Ooh ooh  
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like  
Without you  
No no no  
Without you  
No no  
I can't believe that you would up and leave me  
F**k all of your reasons  
I lost my s**t you know I didn't mean it  
Now I see it you run and repeat it  
And I can't take it back so in the past is where we'll leave it huh  
So there you go oh  
Can't make a wife out of a ho oh  
I'll never find the words to say I'm sorry  
But I'm scared to be alone  
You cut out a piece of me and now I bleed internally  
Left here without you  
No no no  
Without you  
Ooh ooh  
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like  
Without you  
No no no  
Without you  
No no  
Oh-oh woah-oh oh-oh woah-oh  
Oh-oh woah-oh oh-oh woah-oh  
Without you without you you ooh  
Oh-oh woah-oh oh-oh woah-oh  
Oh-oh woah-oh oh-oh woah-oh  
Without you without you ooh  
It's gon' be hard here on my own  
And even harder to let you go I  
Really wish that we could've got this right  
So here I go oh  
Can't make a wife out of a ho oh  
I'll never find the words to say I'm sorry  
But I'm scared to be alone  
Oh  
You cut out a piece of me and now I bleed internally  
Left here without you  
No no no  
Without you  
Ooh ooh  
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like  
Without you  
No no no  
Without you  
No no  
Oh-oh woah-oh oh-oh woah-oh  
Oh-oh woah-oh oh-oh woah-oh  
Without you without you  
No no no
