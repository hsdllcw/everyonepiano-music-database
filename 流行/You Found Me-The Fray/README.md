**You Found Me** 是美国另类摇滚乐队The Fray演唱的歌曲。The
Fray，2002年在美国丹佛市成立，由4人组成，包括：同为校友的Isaac Slade（主唱和钢琴）和Joe King（吉他，演唱）以及后加入的Dave
Welsh（吉他）和Ben Wysocki（鼓手及打击乐器）。

  
新专辑首支单曲 _You Found Me_
在美国强力造势下造成轰动，除了成为电视影集《Lost档案》第五季预告片主题曲外，还献唱于全美音乐奖现场、并在Jimmy
Kimmel脱口秀、早安美国等节目亮相；拿下单曲榜第七名、成人Top40亚军的〈You Found
Me〉创下近百万的销售成绩，音乐录影带还在VH1频道多次获得冠军。

  
The Fray乐队风格与英国的Coldplay和Keane相似，The
Fray是新一批乐坛新兴血液中受英式乐队（诸如Coldplay和Keane）影响较深的一支，也保留了美国90年代传统摇滚Counting Crows和the
Wallflowers的气质，还有点Jimmy Eat World这种EMO乐队的冲劲。但THE
FRAY的特点在于乐队对钢琴的钟爱。也许就是因为钢琴，才使得他们的音乐有种特别的气质。旗帜般飘扬的主音唱腔颇具英式感，骨子里还是保守的美式作风，时不时来点情绪性的激扬调调，他们不是那种风格一脉相承的乐队，截取各家之长是他们一个显而易见的强项。

### You Found Me歌词：

I found God on the corner of 1st and Amistad  
Where the West was all but won  
All alone, smoking his last cigarette  
I said, "Where you been?" He said, "Ask anything"

Where were you when everything was falling apart?  
All my days were spent by the telephone it never rang  
And all I needed was a call that never came  
To the corner of 1st and Amistad

Lost and insecure, you found me, you found me  
Lying on the floor surrounded, surrounded  
Why'd you have to wait? Where were you? Where were you?  
Just a little late, you found me, you found me

But in the end everyone ends up alone  
Losing her, the only one who's ever known  
Who I am, who I'm not and who I wanna be  
No way to know how long she will be next to me

Lost and insecure, you found me, you found me  
Lying on the floor surround me, surround me  
Why'd you have to wait? Where were you? Where were you?  
Just a little late, you found me, you found me!

The early morning, the city breaks  
And I've been calling for years and years and years and years  
And you never left me no messages  
You never sent me no letters  
You got some kind of nerve taking all I want!

Lost and insecure, you found me, you found me  
Lying on the floor, where were you? Where were you?

Lost and insecure, you found me, you found me  
Lying on the floor surrounded, surrounded  
Why'd you have to wait? Where were you? Where were you?  
Just a little late, you found me, you found me.

Why'd you have to wait to find me, to find me?
