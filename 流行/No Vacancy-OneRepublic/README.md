**No Vacancy双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_No Vacancy_ 是美国摇滚乐队OneRepublic演唱的一首歌曲，发行于2017年04月28日。

与一般美国乐队的粗线条不同的是，OneRepublic的音乐感性细腻，音质动人的Tedder一开腔便散发出像是Keane般的英伦摇滚气质，但也不乏坚毅强硬的阳刚之气。另一方面，OneRepublic的音乐也像Maroon5一样很重视节奏感，只不过Maroon5以摇滚融合Funky，而他们则是渗入了R&B以及Hip-
Hop节奏。

### No Vacancy歌词：

I used to leave the doors unlocked and leave the lights on  
I used to stay awake, just counting hours all night long  
I had so many empty rooms inside this chateau  
Yeah, oh yeah  
I'm done with sharing space with people that I don't know  
Trading pieces of my heart til I feel shallow  
I had so many empty rooms inside this chateau, oh  
But ever since I met ya  
No vacancy because of you  
There's no vacancy, no empty rooms  
Got no vacancy ever since I met ya  
No vacancy 'cause of you  
Used to be that I felt so damn empty  
Ever since I met you, no vacancy  
Used to be that I felt so damn empty  
Ever since I met you, no vacancy  
No vacancy, no vacancy  
Used to be that I felt so damn empty  
Ever since I met you, no vacancy  
Used to be that I felt so damn empty  
Ever since I met you, no vacancy  
No vacancy, no vacancy  
I used to be the type to never take a chance, oh  
Had so many walls, you'd think I was a castle  
I spent so many empty nights with faces I don't know  
But ever since I met ya  
No vacancy because of you  
There's no vacancy, no empty rooms  
Got no vacancy ever since I met ya  
No vacancy 'cause of you  
Used to be that I felt so damn empty  
Ever since I met you, no vacancy  
Used to be that I felt so damn empty  
Ever since I met you, no vacancy  
No vacancy, no vacancy  
Come on, come on, listen, oh yeah  
Come on, come on, listen, oh yeah  
When I fell, I fell, I fell, I fell for you  
So no vacancy, no vacancy  
Used to be that I felt so damn empty  
Ever since I met you, no vacancy  
Used to be that I felt so damn empty  
Ever since I met you, no vacancy  
No vacancy, no vacancy  
Come on, come on, listen  
No vacancy, oh yeah  
Oh yeah, no vacancy
