### Suicidal歌词：

Suicidal  
Your love is suicidal  
Lately I've been feeling suicidal  
Your love is suicidal  
I thought that we were meant to be  
You took my heart and made it bleed  
I gave you all my ecstasy  
I know you'll be the death of me  
Left lipstick on my Hennessy  
Felt like you took my soul from me  
You gave me all your ecstasy  
I thought that we were meant to be  
Your love is suicidal  
For me your love is suicidal  
To me your love is suicidal  
To me your love is suicidal  
I'm sippin' Hennessy-'y-'y ooh  
I'm sippin' Hennessy-'y-'y ooh  
I don't want to lose my conscience  
Drinkin' all this Hennessy  
Baby you took control of me  
And I got too many enemies  
I knew you wanted to f**k him 'cause I could just tell  
Check my back now I'm now I'm in my bag yeah  
You did me bad you did me bad  
But I said f**k it and I ran up my bag yeah  
I'm in my bag I'm in my bag now  
But you didn't even put it all on the line  
For me no oh I'm sorry  
This is the end of us  
It's crazy 'cause my heart is dangerous  
Felt like you took my soul from me  
Like the devil got a hold on me  
Everybody wishin' bad on me  
Everybody wishin' bad on me  
You taught a lesson to me that I had to learn  
And I'm so sorry 'cause you let our bridges burn  
I said I loved you and I wish I never did  
I swear to God I swear to God you stupid b***h  
I thought that we were meant to be  
You took my heart and made it bleed  
I gave you all my ecstasy  
I know you'll be the death of me  
Left lipstick on my Hennessy  
Felt like you took my soul from me  
No way I gave you all my ecstasy  
I thought that you were meant for me  
I know you'll be the death of me  
Thought we were for eternity  
You f**ked me up both physically  
And mentally I can't believe  
I'm sippin' Hennessy-'y-'y ooh  
I'm sippin' Hennessy-'y-'y ooh  
I'm sippin' Hennessy-'y-'y ooh  
I'm sippin' Hennessy-'y-'y ooh  
Your love is suicidal  
For me your love is suicidal  
To me your love is suicidal  
To me your love is suicidal  
You taught a lesson to me that I had to learn  
And I'm so sorry 'cause you let our bridges burn  
I said I loved you and I wish I never did  
I swear to God I swear to God you stupid b***h
