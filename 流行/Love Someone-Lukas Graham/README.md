### Love Someone歌词：

There are days  
I wake up and I pinch myself  
You're with me not someone else  
And I am scared yeah I'm so scared  
That it's all a dream  
'Cause you still look perfect as days go by  
Even the worst ones you make me smile  
I'd stop the world if it gave us time  
'Cause when you love someone  
You open up your heart  
When you love someone  
You may grow  
If you love someone  
And you're not afraid to lose them  
You'll probably never love someone like I do  
You'll probably never love someone like I do  
When you say  
You love the way I make you feel  
Everything becomes so real  
Don't be scared no don't be scared  
'Cause you're all I need  
And you still look perfect as days go by  
Even the worst ones you make me smile  
I'd stop the world if it gave us time  
'Cause when you love someone  
You open up your heart  
When you love someone  
You may grow  
If you love someone  
And you're not afraid to lose them  
You'll probably never love someone like I do  
You'll probably never love someone like I do  
All my life  
I thought it'd be hard to find  
The one 'til I found you  
And I find it bittersweet  
'Cause you gave me something to lose  
But when you love someone  
You open up your heart  
When you love someone  
You may grow  
If you love someone  
And you're not afraid to lose them  
You'll probably never love someone like I do  
You'll probably never love someone like I do  
You'll probably never love someone like I do
