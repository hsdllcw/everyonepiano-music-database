### Body Like a Back Road歌词：

Got a girl from the south side, got braids in her hair  
First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell off my chair  
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks  
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed  
I know every curve like the back of my hand  
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry  
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt  
But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help  
Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet  
It ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed  
I know every curve like the back of my hand  
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry  
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

We're out here in the boondocks  
With the breeze and the birds  
Tangled up in the tall grass  
With my lips on hers  
On the highway to heaven  
Headed south of her smile  
Get there when we get there  
Every inch is a mile

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed  
I know every curve like the back of my hand  
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry  
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

I'ma take it slow  
As fast as I can  
Body like a back road  
Drivin' with my eyes closed  
I know every curve like the back of my hand
