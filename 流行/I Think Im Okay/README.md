### I Think I'm Okay歌词：

Machine Gun Kelly：  
Watch me take a good thing and f**k it all up in one night  
Catch me I'm the one on the run away from the headlights  
No sleep up all week wasting time with people I don't like  
I think something's f**king wrong with me  
Drown myself in alcohol that s**t never helps at all  
I might say some stupid things tonight when you pick up this call  
I've been hearing silence on the other side for way too long  
I can taste it on my tongue I can tell that something's wrong but  
I guess it's just my life and I can take it if I wanna  
But I cannot hide in hills of California  
Because these hills have eyes and I got paranoia  
I hurt myself sometimes is that too scary for you  
Machine Gun Kelly/YUNGBLUD：  
Watch me take a good thing and f**k it all up in one night  
Catch me I'm the one on the run away from the headlights  
No sleep up all week wasting time with people I don't like  
I think that something's f**king wrong with me  
YUNGBLUD：  
Roll me up and smoke me love  
And we can fly into the night  
Roll me up and smoke me love  
And we can fly into the night  
You take drugs  
Take drugs  
To let go  
Let go  
And figure it all out on your own  
You take drugs  
Take drugs  
On gravestones  
Gravestones  
To figure it all out on your own  
Machine Gun Kelly/YUNGBLUD：  
Watch me take a good thing and f**k it all up in one night  
Catch me I'm the one on the run away from the headlights  
No sleep up all week wasting time with people I don't like  
I think that something's f**king wrong with me  
YUNGBLUD/Machine Gun Kelly：  
You'll find me alone at midnight  
Inside my mind tryna get things right  
They want to keep you calling  
So you don't wake in the morning  
Something's f**king wrong with me  
Goodnight goodnight  
Goodnight goodnight yeah  
Find me alone at midnight  
Goodnight  
Inside my mind tryna get things right  
Goodnight  
They want to keep you calling  
Goodnight  
So you don't wake in the morning
