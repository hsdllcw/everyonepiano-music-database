### Scarborough Fair歌词：

Are you going to scarborough fair  
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme  
Remember me to one who lives there  
She once was a true love of mine

Tell her to make me a cambric shirt  
(A hill in the deep forest green)  
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme  
(Tracing of sparrow  
On snow-crested brown)  
Without no seams nor needlework  
(Blankets and bedclothes  
The child of the mountain)  
Then she'll be a true love of mine  
(Sleeps unaware of the clarion call)

Tell her to find me an acre of land  
(On the side of a hill  
A sprinkling of leaves)  
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme  
(Washes the grave with silvery tears)  
Between the salt water  
And the sea strand  
(A soldier cleans and polishes a gun)  
Then she'll be a true love of mine

Tell her to reap it  
With a sickle of leather  
(War bellows blazing  
In scarlet battallions)  
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme  
(Generals order their soldiers to kill)  
And gather it all in a bunch of heather  
(And to fight for a cause  
They've long ago forgotten)  
Then she'll be a true love of mine
