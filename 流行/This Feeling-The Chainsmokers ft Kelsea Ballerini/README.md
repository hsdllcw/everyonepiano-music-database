_This Feeling_ 是由美国电音组合烟鬼组合The Chainsmokers制作、烟鬼组合成员安德鲁•塔格特与乡村流行女歌手Kelsea
Ballerini演唱的一首歌曲。单曲于2018年9月19日通过索尼音乐娱乐公司发行。这首歌的创作灵感来源于去年年初发生的一些事，感觉烟鬼真的走不出自己节奏了，这首歌再次复制了当年的经典！

### This Feeling歌词：

I'll tell you a story before it tells itself  
I lay out all my reasons, you say that I need help  
We all got expectations, and sometimes they go wrong  
But no one listens to me, so I put it in this song  
They tell me think with my head, not that thing in my chest  
They got their hands at my neck this time  
But you're the one that I want, if that's really so wrong  
Then they don't know what this feeling is like  
And I say yeah-eah  
Yeah-eah-eah-eah  
Yeah-eah  
Yeah-eah-eah-eah  
And I say yeah-eah  
Yeah-eah-eah-eah  
Yeah-eah  
Yeah-eah-eah-eah  
I'll tell them a story, they'll sit and nod their heads  
I tell you all my secrets, and you tell all your friends  
Hold on to your opinions, and stand by what you say (stand by what you say)  
In the end, it's my decision, so it's my fault when it ends  
They tell me think with my head, not that thing in my chest  
They got their hands at my neck this time  
But you're the one that I want, if that's really so wrong  
Then they don't know what this feeling is like  
And I say yeah-eah  
Yeah-eah-eah-eah  
Yeah-eah  
Yeah-eah-eah-eah  
And I say yeah-eah  
Yeah-eah-eah-eah  
Yeah-eah  
Yeah-eah-eah-eah  
I'll tell you a story before it tells itself  
I lay out all my reasons, you'll say that I need help  
We all got expectations, and sometimes they go wrong  
But no one listens to me, so I put it in this song  
They tell me think with my head, not that thing in my chest  
They got their hands at my neck this time  
But you're the one that I want, if that's really so wrong  
Then they don't know what this feeling is like  
My friends say no-o, no-o-o  
Then they don't know  
No-o, no-o-o  
Yeah, no-o, no-o-o  
They don't know  
No-o, no-o-o  
No, no  
And I say no, oh, oh  
And I say no, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
They don't know, oh
