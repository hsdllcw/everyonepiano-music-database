### Vulnerable歌词：

If I give you every piece of me I know that you could drop it  
Give you the chance I know that you could take advantage once you got it  
If I open up my heart to you I know that you could lock it  
Throw away the key and keep it there forever in your pocket  
If I give the opportunity to you then would you blow it  
If I was the greatest thing to happen to you would you know it  
If my love was like a flower would you plant it Would you grow it  
I'ma give you all my body are you strong enough to hold it  
If I show you all my demons and we dive into the deep end  
Would we crash and burn like every time before  
I would tell you all my secrets wrap your arms around my weakness  
If the only other option's letting go  
I'll stay vulnerable yeah  
I'll stay vulnerable yeah  
I'll stay vulnerable  
If I hand you my emotion would you even wanna take it  
Would you even wanna take it Yeah  
If I give you all my trust then would you fumble it and break it  
Mmm mmm mmm mmm  
If I let you cross my finish line then what you wanna make it  
What you wanna make it what you wanna make it  
I think I'm ready won't you come and flip the switch and activate it  
Ooh ooh  
If I show you all my demons and we dive into the deep end  
Would we crash and burn like every time before  
I would tell you all my secrets wrap your arms around my weakness  
If the only other option's letting go  
I'll stay vulnerable yeah  
Yeah yeah  
Yeah I'll stay vulnerable yeah  
I'll stay vulnerable yeah  
Yeah yeah  
If I show you all my demons and we dive into the deep end  
Would we crash and burn like every time before  
I would tell you all my secrets wrap your arms around my weakness  
If the only other option's letting go  
I'll stay vulnerable yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
I'll stay vulnerable yeah  
Ooh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
If I show you all my demons and we dive into the deep end  
Would we crash and burn like every time before  
I'll stay vulnerable  
I would tell you all my secrets wrap your arms around my weakness  
If the only other option's letting go  
I'll stay vulnerable
