**Run Run Run** 是风靡欧美的德国摇滚乐队Tokio
Hotel的回归新作。此次回归单曲主唱在钢琴前用略带沙哑的嗓音，轻柔的为人们谱写一曲柔美之歌。当旋律响起，黑白的剪影在眼前不断闪过。

  
Tokio Hotel 主音和吉他手是一对双胞胎。出道单曲Durch den Monsun曾经位居德国排行榜第1名。

### Run Run Run歌词：

I wonder how your body tastes  
Inside of someone else's place  
Pull away your eyes  
There's nothing left to heal  
I'm alone, but I know everything you feel  
And you waited on the rain  
Through tears my heart is caged  
And we fall through fate  
But we rise and rise again  
And I run, run, run, run, run  
And I run, run, run, run, run  
I run, run, run, run, run  
I just run run run  
Tell me how you closed the door  
Knowin' nobody could love you more  
Tellin' all your friends that this love was just made for bleedin'  
Hung up underwater but still keep on, tryin' to breath in  
And you waited on the rain  
Through tears my heart is caged  
And we fall through fate  
But we rise and rise again  
And I run, run, run, run, run  
And I run, run, run, run, run  
I run, run, run, run, run  
I just run run run  
Our lust for fighting  
Tied up in silence  
And you waited on the rain  
Through tears my heart is caged  
And we fall through fate  
But we rise and rise again  
And I run, run, run, run, run  
And I run, run, run, run, run  
I run, run, run, run, run  
I just run run run
