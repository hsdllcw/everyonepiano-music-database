### She's All I Wanna Be歌词：

You want the girl with the small waist  
And the perfect smile  
Someone who's out every week day  
In her dad's new car  
You tell me I shouldn't stress out  
Say it's not that hard  
But I just got a feelin'  
This'll leave an ugly scar  
If you say she's nothing to worry about  
Then why'd you close your eyes when you said it out loud?  
Stupid boy makin' me so sad  
Didn't think you could change this fast  
She's got everything that I don't have  
How could I ever compete with that?  
I know you'll go and change your mind  
One day wake up and be bored with mine  
She's got everything that I don't have  
And she's all I wanna be  
All I wanna be so bad  
So bad  
She's got everything that I don't have, mm  
You want someone you can show off  
Whenever you go out  
She'll wear a tight mini black dress  
With all her friends around  
And then you'll probably spend the night at  
Her nice big house  
And by then, I'll just be someone  
You've forgotten about, oh  
If you say she's nothing to worry about  
Then why'd you close your eyes when you said it out loud?  
Stupid boy makin' me so sad  
Didn't think you could change this fast  
She's got everything that I don't have  
How could I ever compete with that?  
I know you'll go and change your mind  
One day wake up and be bored with mine  
She's got everything that I don't have  
And she's all I wanna be  
All I wanna be so bad  
So bad  
She's got everything that I don't have  
And she's all I wanna be  
All I wanna be  
Ooh (ooh)  
(Ooh)  
She's all I wanna be so bad  
(Ooh)  
Oh (ooh)  
Stupid boy makin' me so sad  
Didn't think it would hurt this bad  
She's got everything that I don't have  
How could I ever compete with that?  
I know you'll go and change your mind  
One day wake up and be bored with mine  
She's got everything that I don't have  
And she's all I wanna be  
All I wanna be so bad  
All I wanna be so bad  
She's got everything that I don't have  
And she's all I wanna be  
All I wanna be so bad
