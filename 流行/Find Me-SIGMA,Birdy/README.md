### Find Me歌词：

We said goodbye  
That's what you told me once  
So many times we've made our peace  
But this is love I'll never give you up  
I know you'll always come home to me  
Like a river always running  
I keep losing you  
Like a fire always burning  
I'll be here for you  
If you're ready heart is open  
I'll be waiting come and find me  
If you're searching for forever  
I'll be waiting come and find me  
Come and find me  
Come and find me  
Come and find me  
Come and find me  
We've lost our way  
That's what you told me last  
But tears they come and go  
This is us I'll never get enough  
It's taking losing you to know  
If you're ready heart is open  
I'll be waiting come and find me  
If you're searching for forever  
I'll be waiting come and find me  
Come and find me  
Come and find me
