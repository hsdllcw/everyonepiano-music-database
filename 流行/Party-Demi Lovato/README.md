### Party歌词：

I saw you looking over  
Now I see you moving this way  
Pushing through the crowd  
Like you got something to say, yeah

But you couldn't walk  
Cause the music's taking over your feet  
I can tell by your toes  
That you're rocking to this beat

You gotta dance til you ache  
Til you drop, til you break  
Free your soul, let me see you shake  
One by one we're stealing the stage  
Here we come, so get out of our way

It won't be long til the summers gone  
Get your party on, so we'll sing along  
Hold on tight, it's a crazy night  
Get your party on, so we'll scream it out loud  
Yeah

I know your type and all the hype is going  
Straight to your head  
And everybody's stopping what their doing  
Cause your face is turning red, yeah

Gotta learn how to move to the groove  
Give in, or get out  
Put your hands in the air, stand up  
In your chair and shout

You're all dolled up with nowhere to go  
You wanna get out and put on a show  
There's nothing wrong with staying home  
As long as you've got your radio

It won't be long til the summers gone  
Get your party on, so we'll sing along  
Hold on tight, it's a crazy night  
Get your party on, so we'll scream it

Don't wait and don't ya be late  
Get your party on, so we'll sing along  
Hold on tight, it's a crazy night  
Get your party on, so we'll scream it out loud

Dallas, Texas  
Bring it home for me, baby

The little things that you do  
From across the room  
I see you sending me clues  
There in the way you make me move

It won't be long til the summers gone  
Get your party on, so we'll sing along  
Hold on tight, it's a crazy night  
Get your party on, so we'll scream it

Don't wait and don't ya be late  
Get your party on, so we'll sing along  
Hold on tight, it's a crazy night  
Get your party on and scream it out loud

Get your party on  
Get your, get your party on  
(Scream it out loud)  
Get your party on  
Get your, get your party on

Let's do it again
