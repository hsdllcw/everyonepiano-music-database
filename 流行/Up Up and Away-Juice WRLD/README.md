### Up Up and Away歌词：

Yeah  
Up up and away I can feel the walls in my brain  
And they're caving in  
Outside those walls there's an ocean  
I can't swim especially with all these waves  
I'm walkin' in Prada tryna solve my problems  
Through the night finding vibes Moonlight Sonata  
I try to deny but you see the pills in my eyes  
I tell her that I'm high but she don't seem surprised  
Walkin' in Prada tryna solve my problems  
Through the night finding vibes Moonlight Sonata  
I try to deny but you see the pills in my eyes  
I tell her that I'm high but she don't seem surprised  
Maybe I realized that my life is a ride  
Buckle up hold tight take a left turn right  
GPS don't work can't see at night  
So it's getting hard to drive anxiety at the stoplights  
Hard to think easy to cry that's how I know something's not right  
Numb the pain with fun times super motos Perc lines  
Remember that one time everything was alright  
Alright  
Oh-oh-oh  
Up up and away I can feel the walls in my brain  
And they're caving in  
Outside those walls there's an ocean  
I can't swim especially with all these waves  
I'm walkin' in Prada tryna solve my problems  
Through the night finding vibes Moonlight Sonata  
I try to deny but you see the pills in my eyes  
I tell her that I'm high but she don't seem surprised  
Walkin' in Prada tryna solve my problems  
Through the night finding vibes Moonlight Sonata  
I try to deny but you see the pills in my eyes  
I tell her that I'm high but she don't seem surprised  
Up up and away I can feel the walls in my brain  
And they're caving in  
Outside those walls there's an ocean  
I can't swim especially with all these waves
