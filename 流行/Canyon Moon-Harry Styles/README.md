### Canyon Moon歌词：

Gotta see it to believe it sky never looked so blue  
So hard to leave it that's what I always do  
So I keep thinking back to a time under the canyon moon  
The world's happy waitin' door's yellow broken blue  
I heard Jenny saying go get the kids from school  
And I keep thinking back to the time under the canyon moon  
I've been gone too long from you  
Staring at the ceiling two weeks and I'll be home  
Carry the feeling through Paris all through Rome  
And I'm still thinking back to the time under the canyon moon  
I'm going oh I'm going  
I'm going oh I'm going  
I'm going oh I'm going home  
I'm going oh I'm going  
I'm going oh I'm going  
I'm going oh I'm going home  
Quick pause in conversation she plays songs I've never heard  
An old lover's hippie music pretends not to know the words  
And I keep thinking back to the time under the canyon moon  
I've been gone too long from you  
I'm going oh I'm going  
I'm going oh I'm going  
I'm going oh I'm going home  
I'm going oh I'm going  
Home  
I'm going oh I'm going  
I'm going home  
I'm going oh I'm going home  
Yeah  
I'm going oh I'm going  
I'm going home  
I'm going oh I'm going  
I'm going home  
I'm going oh I'm going home  
Hey
