### Let's Fall in Love for the Night歌词：

Let's fall in love for the night  
And forget in the morning  
Play me a song that you like  
You can bet I'll know every line  
I'm a boy that your boy hoped that you would avoid  
Don't waste your eyes on jealous guys  
F**k that noise  
I know better than to call you mine  
You need a pick me up  
I'll be there in twenty five  
I like to push my luck  
So take my hand let's take a drive  
I've been living in the future  
Hoping I might see you sooner  
I want you right at shotgun I knew  
When I got one right  
Let's fall in love for the night  
And forget in the morning  
Play me a song that you like  
You can bet I'll know every line  
I'm a boy that your boy hoped that you would avoid  
Don't waste your eyes on jealous guys  
F**k that noise  
I know better than to call you mine  
I love it when you talk that nerdy s**t  
We're in our twenties talking thirties s**t  
We're making money but we're saving it  
'Cause talking s**t is cheap and we talk a lot of it  
You won't stay with me I know  
But you can have your way with me 'till you go  
And before your kisses turn into bruises  
I'm a warning  
Let's fall in love for the night  
And forget in the morning  
Play me a song that you like  
You can bet I'll know every line  
'Coz I'm a boy that your boy hoped that you would avoid  
Don't waste your eyes on jealous guys  
F**k that noise  
I know better I know better  
I know better than to ever call you mine
