### Too Good歌词：

[Drake:]  
Oh yeah yeah yeah  
Oh yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah, look  
I don't know how to talk to you  
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay  
My friends always feel the need to tell me things  
Seems like they're just happier than us these days  
Yeah, these days I don't know how to talk to you  
I don't know how to be there when you need me  
It feels like the only time you'll see me  
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently

Yeah, and last night I think I lost my patience  
Last night I got high as your expectations  
Last night, I came to a realization  
And I hope you can take it  
I hope you can take it

I'm too good to you  
I'm way too good to you  
You take my love for granted  
I just don't understand it  
No, I'm too good to you  
I'm way too good to you  
You take my love for granted  
I just don't understand it

[Rihanna:]  
I don't know how to talk to you  
I just know I find myself getting lost with you  
Lately you just make me work too hard for you  
Got me on flights overseas, and I still can't get across to you

And last night I think I lost my patience  
Last night I got high as your expectations  
Last night, I came to a realization  
And I hope you can take it  
I hope you can take it

[Drake & Rihanna:]  
I'm too good to you  
I'm way too good to you  
You take my love for granted  
I just don't understand it  
No, I'm too good to you  
I'm way too good to you  
You take my love for granted  
I just don't understand it

[Drake:]  
Years go by too fast  
I can't keep track  
How long did we last?  
I feel bad for asking  
It can't end like this  
We gotta take time with this  
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down 'pon it  
Let me see if this is something I can fix  
You got somebody other than me  
Don't play the victim when you're with me  
Free time is costing me more than it seems  
Sacrificing things  
And I wanna tell you my intentions  
I wanna do the things that I mention  
I wanna benefit from the friendship  
I wanna get the late night message from you, from you  
I put my hands around you  
Gotta get a handle on you  
Gotta get a handle on the fact that...

[Drake & Rihanna:]  
I'm too good to you  
I'm way too good to you  
You take my love for granted  
I just don't understand it  
No, I'm too good to you  
I'm way too good to you  
You take my love for granted  
I just don't understand it

[Popcaan:]  
Gyal a you mi waan  
Pay fi yuh visa meck yo fly out regular, BRB  
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down 'pon it  
Gyal yo pum pum good and yuh fit  
Give you everything weh deh in my wallet  
And in my pocket  
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down 'pon it  
Gyal yo pum pum good and yuh fit  
Give you everything weh deh in my wallet  
And in my pocket
