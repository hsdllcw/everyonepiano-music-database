### Daisies歌词：

Told them your dreams  
And they all started laughing  
I guess you're out of your mind  
'Til it actually happens  
I'm the small town  
One in seven billion  
Why can't it be me  
They told me I was out there  
Tried to knock me down  
Took those sticks and stones  
Showed 'em I could build a house  
They tell me that I'm crazy  
But I'll never let 'em change me  
'Til they cover me in daisies daisies daisies  
They said I'm going nowhere  
Tried to count me out  
Took those sticks and stones  
Showed 'em I could build a house  
They tell me that I'm crazy  
But I'll never let 'em change me  
'Til they cover me in daisies daisies daisies  
When did we all stop believing in magic  
Why did we put all our hopes in a box in the attic  
I'm the long shot  
I'm the Hail Mary  
Why can't it be me  
They told me I was out there  
Tried to knock me down  
Took those sticks and stones  
Showed 'em I could build a house  
They tell me that I'm crazy  
But I'll never let 'em change me  
'Til they cover me in daisies daisies daisies  
They said I'm going nowhere  
Tried to count me out  
Took those sticks and stones  
Showed 'em I could build a house  
They tell me that I'm crazy  
But I'll never let 'em change me  
'Til they cover me in daisies daisies daisies  
Cover me in daisies  
I'm the small town  
One in seven billion  
Why can't it be me  
They told me I was out there  
Tried to knock me down  
Took those sticks and stones  
Showed 'em I could build a house  
They tell me that I'm crazy  
But I'll never let 'em change me  
'Til they cover me in daisies daisies daisies  
They said I'm going nowhere  
Tried to count me out  
Took those sticks and stones  
Showed 'em I could build a house  
They tell me that I'm crazy  
But I'll never let 'em change me  
'Til they cover me in daisies daisies daisies
