### I Forgive You 歌词：

I forgive you, I forgive me  
Now when do I start to feel again  
I forgive you, I forgive me  
Now when do I start to feel again

'Cause the lights are on  
But I'm never home  
But I'll be back with a brand new attitude  
'Cause I forgive you

I forgive you  
We were just a couple of kids  
Trying to figure out how to live  
Doing it our way  
No shame, no blame  
'Cause the damage is done  
And I forgive you  
I forgive you  
We were busy living the dream  
Never noticed the glass ceiling falling on us  
No shame, no blame  
'Cause the damage is done  
And I forgive you

I forgive you, I forgive me  
Now do I start to feel again  
If I hate you, what does that do  
So I breathe in and I count to 10

'Cause the lights are on  
And I'm coming home  
Yes I am back  
With a new heart in my hand  
'Cause I forgive you

I forgive you  
We were just a couple of kids  
Trying to figure out how to live  
Doing it our way  
No shame, no blame  
'Cause the damage is done  
And I forgive you  
I forgive you  
We were busy living the dream  
Never noticed the glass ceiling falling on us  
No shame, no blame  
'Cause the damage is done  
And I forgive you

I forgive you  
For every time that I cried  
Over some stupid thing you did to hurt me  
That's alright, yeah I forgive you

I forgive you  
We were just a couple of kids  
Trying to figure out how to live  
Doing it our way  
No shame, no blame  
'Cause the damage is done  
And I forgive you

I forgive you  
We were just a couple of kids  
Trying to figure out how to live  
Doing it our way  
No shame, no blame  
'Cause the damage is done  
And I forgive you  
I forgive you  
We were busy living the dream  
Never noticed the glass ceiling falling on us  
No shame, no blame  
'Cause the damage is done  
And I forgive you
