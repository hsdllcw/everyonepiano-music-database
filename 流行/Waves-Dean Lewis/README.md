### Waves歌词：

There  
Is a swelling storm  
And I'm caught up in the middle of it all  
And it takes control  
Of the person that I thought I was  
The boy I used to know  
But there is a light  
In the dark  
And I feel its warmth  
In my hands  
In my heart  
Why can't I hold on  
It comes and goes in waves  
It always does  
Always does  
We watch as our young hearts fade  
Into the flood  
Into the flood  
And freedom  
And falling  
The feeling I thought was set in stone  
It slips through my fingers  
Trying hard to let go  
It comes and goes in waves  
It comes and goes in waves  
And carries us away  
Through the wind  
Down to the place we used to lay when we were kids  
Memories of a stolen place  
Caught in the silence  
An echo lost in space  
It comes and goes in waves  
It always does  
It always does  
We watch as our young hearts fade  
Into the flood  
Into the flood  
And freedom  
And falling  
The feeling I thought was set in stone  
Slips through my fingers  
Trying hard to let go  
It comes and goes in waves  
It comes and goes in waves  
And carries us away  
I watched my world youth  
Disappear in front of my eyes  
Moments of magic and wonder  
It seems so hard to find  
Is it ever coming back again  
Is it ever coming back again  
Take me back to the feeling when  
Everything was left to find  
It comes and goes in waves  
It always does  
We always does  
And freedom  
And falling  
The feeling I thought was set in stone  
It slips through my fingers  
Trying hard to let go  
It comes and goes in waves  
It comes and goes in waves  
And carries us away
