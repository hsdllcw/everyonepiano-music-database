**God Knows I Tried双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_God Knows I Tried_ 是美国创作女歌手Lana Del Rey演唱的一首歌曲，收录在其录音室专辑《Honeymoon》中。Lana Del
Rey之所以会为专辑取这个标题的原因，是因为她本人认为“Honeymoon”这个词代表了终极梦想的总和，蜜月就是生命、爱情、天堂、自由等等，它们都是永恒的。此外，Lana
Del
Rey也对自己这张专辑的音乐艺术风格定位明晰，表示专辑听起来会与她上一张录音室专辑《Ultraviolence》完全不同，专辑的音乐风格会比较接近于她的首张录音室专辑《Born
to Die》，这也是她个人比较喜欢的一种音乐类型。

### God Knows I Tried歌词：

Sometimes I wake up in the morning  
To red, blue, and yellow skies  
It's so crazy I could drink it like tequila sunrise  
Put on that Hotel California  
Dance around like I'm insane  
I feel free when I see no one  
And nobody knows my name

God knows I live  
God knows I died  
God knows I begged  
Begged, borrowed and cried  
God knows I loved  
God knows I lied  
God knows I lost  
God gave me life  
And God knows I tried  
God knows I tried  
God knows I tried  
God knows I tried

Sometimes I wake up in the morning  
To red, blue and yellow lights  
On Monday they destroyed me  
But by Friday I'm revived  
Put on that hotel California  
Wear my blinders in the rain  
I've got nothing much to live for  
Ever since I found my fame

God knows I live  
God knows I died  
God knows I loved  
God know I lied  
God knows I begged  
Begged, borrowed and cried  
God knows I lost  
God gave me life  
God knows I tried  
God knows I tried  
God knows I tried  
God knows I tried

So let there be light  
Let there be light  
Light up my life  
Light up my life  
Let there be light  
Let there be light  
Light up my life  
Light up my life

God knows I tried  
God knows I tried  
God knows I tried  
God knows I tried  
God knows I tried  
God knows I tried  
God knows I tried  
God knows I tried
