### Don't Let It Break Your Heart歌词：

And if I lost the map  
If I lost it all  
Or fell into the trap  
Then she'd call

When you're tired of racing and you  
Found you never left the start  
Come on baby, Don't Let It Break Your Heart

Though heavily we bled  
Still on we crawl  
Try to catch a cannonball.  
And a slowly burning tide (oh)  
Through my veins is flowing.  
From my shipwreck I heard her call  
And she sang

When you're tired of aiming your arrows,  
Still you never hit the mark  
And even if your aims are shadows  
Still we're never gonna part

Come on baby don't let it break your heart  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
Don't Let It Break Your Heart  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
Don't Let It Break Your Heart

Don't Let It Break Your Heart’
