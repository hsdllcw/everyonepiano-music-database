### Adore歌词：

I'm just gonna stand with my bag hanging off my left arm  
I'm just gonna walk home kicking stones at parked cars  
But I had a great night coz you kept rubbing against my arm  
I'm just gonna stand with my bag hanging off my left arm  
Get me a drink I get drunk off one sip  
Just so I can adore you  
I want the entire street out of town  
Just so I can be alone with you  
Now go when your ready my heads getting heavy pressed against your arm  
I adore you  
All off my money is spent on these nights just so we can hang out  
Spacing in and out of these dresses I wanna be found  
By you  
Found by you  
Get me a drink I get drunk off one sip  
Just so I can adore you  
I want the entire street out of town  
Just so I can be alone with you  
Now go when your ready my heads getting heavy pressed against your arm  
I adore you I adore you  
I kick the gutter in tight shorts basketball courts  
Watch me watch him talk to girls  
I'm known as a right hand slugger  
Anybody else wanna touch my lover  
Get me a drink I get drunk off one sip  
Just so I can adore you  
I want the entire street out of town  
Just so I can be alone with you  
Now go when your ready my heads getting heavy pressed against your arm  
Just to adore you I adore you
