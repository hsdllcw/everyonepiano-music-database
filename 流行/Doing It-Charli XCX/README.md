### Doing It歌词：

We're staying all night  
We never slow down  
I think we better do it like we're doing it now  
It's been a long time  
Since we've been around  
So come on, let's keep doing it like we're doing it  
Doing it like we're doing it

Waited so long just to be here  
And now we're bringing this back to life,  
Yeah, we're bringing this back to life  
Want you to know how I miss ya  
And now I got you right by my side,  
Yeah, I got you right by my side

Locked inside my veins you're in my blood, in my blood  
And we're united forevermore

We're staying all night  
We never slow down  
I think we better do it like we're doing it now  
It's been a long time  
Since we've been around  
So come on, let's keep doing it like we're doing it  
Doing it like we're doing it now  
Keep doing it like we're doing it  
Doing it like we're doing it

Friends like a team and a sucker  
We're together we're so alive,  
Yeah, together we're so alive  
Bend like a jewel let it sparkle  
Know that I got your back for life,  
Yeah, I got your back for life

Locked inside my veins you're in my blood, in my blood  
And we're united forevermore

We're staying all night  
We never slow down  
I think we better do it like we're doing it now  
It's been a long time  
Since we've been around  
So come on, let's keep doing it like we're doing it  
Doing it like we're doing it now  
Keep doing it like we're doing it  
Doing it like we're doing it now  
Keep doing it like we're doing it  
Doing it like we're doing it

All night long  
We dancing to this song  
We doing it, we going on and on, on and on  
All night long  
We dancing to this song  
We doing it, we going on and on, on and on

We're staying all night  
We never slow down  
I think we better do it like we're doing it now  
It's been a long time  
Since we've been around  
So come on, let's keep doing it like we're doing it  
Doing it like we're doing it now

All night long  
We dancing to this song  
Keep doing it like we're doing it  
Doing it like we're doing it now  
All night long  
We dancing to this song  
Keep doing it like we're doing it  
Doing it like we're doing it now

We're staying all night  
We never slow down  
I think we better do it like we're doing it now  
It's been a long time  
Since we've been around  
So come on, let's keep doing it like we're doing it  
Doing it like we're doing it now, baby
