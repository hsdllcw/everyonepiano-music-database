### I Should Probably Go to Bed歌词：

All my friends finally convinced  
Me to get out of the house  
To help me forget to help me move on  
Then I heard you're back in town  
In a crowd of strangers and lovers  
Someone told me that you were coming so  
I should probably go to bed  
I should probably turn off my phone  
I should quit while I'm ahead  
I should probably leave you alone  
'Cause I know in the morning  
In the morning  
I'll be calling  
I'll be calling  
Saying sorry for the things I said so  
I yeah I should probably go to bed  
So I don't undo the 'got over you'  
That it took so long to find  
'Cause all it would take  
Is seeing your face and I'd forget  
I should probably go to bed  
I should probably turn off my phone  
I should quit while I'm ahead  
I should probably leave you alone  
'Cause I know in the morning  
In the morning  
I'll be calling  
I'll be calling  
Saying sorry for the things I said so  
I yeah I should probably go to bed  
Before I question my decision  
Is it love I know it isn't  
Now I'm all up in my head again  
'Cause I know I don't  
Have the self-control  
To walk away if you walk in  
Oh  
I know I know I know I know  
I should probably go to bed  
Ooh-ah I'm all up in my head  
I'm all up in my head  
Ooh-ah I should go to bed  
Go to bed go to bed  
Ooh-ah I'm all up in my head  
Go to bed  
Ooh-ah I should go to bed  
In a crowd of strangers and lovers  
Someone told me that you were coming so  
I should probably go to bed
