### I Took A Pill In Ibiza歌词：

I took a pill in Ibiza  
To show Avicii I was cool  
And when I finally got sober, felt 10 years older  
But fuck it, it was something to do  
I'm living out in LA  
I drive a sports car just to prove  
I'm a real big baller cause I made a million dollars  
And I spend it on girls and shoes  
But you don't wanna be high like me  
Never really knowing why like me  
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster  
And be all alone  
You don't wanna ride the bus like this  
Never knowing who to trust like this  
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing  
Stuck up on that stage singing  
All I know are sad songs, sad songs  
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs  
I'm just a singer who already blew his shot  
I get along with old timers  
Cause my name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot  
And I can't keep a girl, no  
Cause as soon as the sun comes up  
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse  
But the truth is I can't open up  
Now you don't wanna be high like me  
Never really knowing why like me  
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster  
And be all alone  
You don't wanna ride the bus like this  
Never knowing who to trust like this  
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing  
Stuck up on that stage singing  
All I know are sad songs, sad songs  
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs  
I took a plane to my home town  
I brought my pride and my guitar  
All my friends are all gone but there's manicured lawns  
And the people still think I'm a star  
I walked around downtown  
I met some fans on Lafayette  
They said tell us how to make it cause we're getting real impatient  
So I looked 'em in the eye and said  
You don't wanna be high like me  
Never really knowing why like me  
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster  
And be all alone  
You don't wanna ride the bus like this  
Never knowing who to trust like this  
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing  
Stuck up on that stage singing  
All I know are sad songs, sad songs  
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs
