### Black Parade歌词：

Ah  
I'm goin' back to the South  
I'm goin' back back back back  
Where my roots ain't watered down  
Growin' growin' like a Baobab tree  
Of life on fertile ground ancestors put me on game  
Ankh charm on gold chains with my Oshun energy oh  
Drip all on me woo Ankh or the Dashiki print  
Hol' up don't I smell like such a nag champa incense  
Yeah pure ice  
Ice  
Ice  
Ice  
Buss down  
Uh flooded  
Flooded  
Flooded  
Flooded  
On my wrist out  
Ooh goin' up goin' up motherland motherland drip on me  
Ooh melanin melanin my drip is skin deep like  
Ooh motherland motherland motherland motherland drip on me  
Ooh yeah I can't forget my history is her-story yeah  
Being black maybe that's the reason why  
They always mad yeah they always mad yeah  
Been past 'em I know that's the reason why  
They all big mad and they always have been  
Honey come around my way around my hive  
Whenever momma says so momma say  
Here I come on my throne sittin' high  
Follow my parade oh my parade  
Talkin' slick to my folk  
My folk  
Lift that lip like lipo  
Lipo  
You hear them swarmin' right Bees is known to bite  
Now here we come on our thrones sittin' high  
Follow my parade oh my parade

All chrome

Roll by my window down let 'em see who in it  
Crack a big smile

Go figure me and Jigga fifty 'leven children  
They like "Chick how"  
I charge my crystals in a full moon  
You could send them missiles I'ma send my goons  
Baby sister reppin' Yemaya  
Yemaya  
Trust me they gon' need an army  
Ah  
Rubber bullets bouncin' off me  
Ah  
Made a picket sign off your picket fence  
Ah  
Take it as a warning  
Ah ah  
Waist beads from Yoruba  
Woo  
Four hunnid billi' Mansa Musa

Stroll line to the barbeque  
Put us any-d**n-where we gon' make it look cute  
Pandemic fly on the runway in my hazmat  
Judgin' runnin' through the house to my art all black  
Ancestors on the wall let the ghosts chit-chat  
Ancestors on the wall let the ghosts chit-chat  
Hold my hands we gon' pray together  
Lay down face down in the gravel  
Woo wearin' all attire white to the funeral  
Black love we gon' stay together  
Curtis Mayfield on the speaker  
Woo  
Lil' Malcolm Martin mixed with momma Tina  
Woo  
Need another March lemme call Tamika

Need peace and reparation for my people

F**k these laid edges I'ma let it shrivel up  
Shrivel up  
F**k this fade and waves I'ma let it dread all up  
Dread all up  
Put your fists up in the air show black love
