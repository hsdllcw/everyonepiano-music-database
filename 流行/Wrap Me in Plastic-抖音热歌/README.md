**Wrap Me in Plastic**
原是Chromance演唱的一首歌曲，单曲于2017年10月27日发行。然于2020年，此曲在抖音上爆火。于是韩国女子演唱团体Momoland与Chromance重新演绎了这首歌。

超棒的节奏，甜美轻快自然的曲调，完美的嗓音，没有一丝杂乱的感觉，俏皮的旋律让人一开始从心里放松，简直是百听不厌啊！

### Wrap Me in Plastic歌词：

It's my first night out with you  
Treat me right and buy me shoes  
Let me be your fantasy play with me  
I wanna be your girl  
Wanna be your girl wanna be your  
Just give me some time  
I'll be ready  
Do my make-up  
Bathe in my perfume  
Quick shower  
Won't take too long  
I'll be done just sing this song  
So wrap me in plastic  
And make me shine  
We can make a dollhouse  
Follow your design  
Let's build a dog  
Out of sticks and twine  
I can call you master  
You can call me mine  
Wrap me in plastic  
And make me shine  
We can make a dollhouse  
Follow your design  
Let's build a dog  
Out of sticks and twine  
I can call you master  
You can call me mine  
Wrap me in plastic  
Wrap me in plastic  
Wrap me in plastic  
Wrap me in plastic  
You can call me mine  
You can call me mine  
Move me tell me what to do  
If you're happy I am too  
Please just show me what you like don't be shy  
I wanna be your girl  
Just give me some time  
I'll be ready  
Do my make-up  
Bathe in my perfume  
Quick shower  
Won't take too long  
I'll be done just sing this song  
So wrap me in plastic  
And make me shine  
We can make a dollhouse  
Follow your design  
Let's build a dog  
Out of sticks and twine  
I can call you master  
You can call me mine  
Wrap me in plastic  
And make me shine  
We can make a dollhouse  
Follow your design  
Let's build a dog  
Out of sticks and twine  
I can call you master  
You can call me mine  
Wrap me in plastic  
Wrap me in plastic  
Wrap me in plastic  
Wrap me in plastic  
You can call me mine  
You can call me mine  
Just give me some time  
I'll be ready  
Quick shower  
Won't take too long  
Just give me some time  
I'll be ready  
Quick shower  
Won't take too long  
Just sing this song  
Wrap me in plastic  
And make me shine  
We can make a dollhouse  
Follow your design  
Let's build a dog  
Out of sticks and twine  
I can call you master  
You can call me mine  
Wrap me in plastic  
We can make a dollhouse  
Follow your design  
I can call you master  
You can call me mine
