### Let It Go歌词：

From walking home and talking loads  
To seeing shows in evening clothes with you  
From nervous touch and getting drunk  
To staying up and waking up with you

But now we're slipping at the edge  
Holding something we don't need  
All this delusion in our heads  
Is gonna bring us to our knees

So come on let it go  
Just let it be  
Why don't you be you  
And I'll be me

Everything that's broke  
Leave it to the breeze  
Why don't you be you  
And I'll be me

And I'll be me

From throwing clothes across the floor  
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you  
If this is all we're living for  
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore

I used to recognize myself  
It's funny how reflections change  
When we're becoming something else  
I think it's time to walk away

So come on let it go  
Just let it be  
Why don't you be you  
And I'll be me

Everything that's broke  
Leave it to the breeze  
Why don't you be you  
And I'll be me

And I'll be me

Trying to fit your hand inside of mine  
When we know it just don't belong  
There's no force on earth  
Could make me feel right, no

Whoa

Trying to push this problem up the hill  
When it's just too heavy to hold  
Think now's the time to let it slide

So come on let it go  
Just let it be  
Why don't you be you  
And I'll be me

Everything that's broke  
Leave it to the breeze  
Let the ashes fall  
Forget about me

Come on let it go  
Just let it be  
Why don't you be you  
And I'll be me  
And I'll be me
