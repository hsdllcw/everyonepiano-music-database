### Dear Lover歌词：

Leigh-Anne：  
I've seen some places and so many faces  
But you look like home tonight  
You crave attention and I need affection  
So let's walk the silver line  
Perrie：  
All you need is my  
All you need is my love  
I got a little bit left to give up  
All I need is your  
All I need is your touch  
Baby that's all I'm asking of you  
Jade：  
Dear lover  
I'm incapable of saving your heart this time  
But if you wanna  
I'll pretend to be your hero for just tonight  
Break：  
I'll pretend to be your hero for just tonight  
Jesy：  
You've been believin'  
There's more to this feelin'  
I swear I wish there was  
But when the moment is over  
We'll walk away closer  
Maybe that's good enough  
Jade：  
All you need is my  
All you need is my love  
I got a little bit left to give up  
All I need is your  
All I need is your touch  
Baby that's all I'm asking of you  
Jade：  
Dear lover  
I'm incapable of saving your heart this time  
But if you wanna  
I'll pretend to be your hero for just tonight  
Break：  
I'll pretend to be your hero for just tonight  
Leigh-Anne：  
All you need is my  
All you need is my love  
I got a little bit left to give up  
All I need is your  
All I need is your touch  
Oh baby that's all I'm asking of you  
Ooh  
Both：  
Dear lover dear lover dear lover  
I'm incapable of saving your heart this time incapable of saving  
But if you wanna  
I'll pretend to be your hero for just tonight tonight  
Break：  
I'll pretend to be your hero for just tonight
