Burning Gold歌词：

  

Looking for an exit in this world of fear  
I can see the path that leads the way  
Mama never left, and daddy needs me here  
I wish the wind would carry a change  
Looking through the window to a world of dreams  
I can see my future slip away  
Honey you won’t get there if you don’t believe  
I wish the wind would carry a change

I've had enough  
I’m standing up  
I need, I need a change  
I've had enough of chasing luck  
I need, I need a change

I’m setting fire to the life that I know  
Let's start a fire everywhere that we go  
We starting fires, we starting fires  
'Til our lives are burning gold  
'Til our lives are burning gold

Looking for my ticket to a higher place  
I can see my chance begin to fade  
One step forward and two back again  
I wish the wind would carry a change

I've had enough  
I’m standing up  
I need, I need a change  
I've had enough of chasing luck  
I need, I need a change

I’m setting fire to the life that I know  
Let's start a fire everywhere that we go  
We starting fires, we starting fires  
'Til our lives are burning gold  
'Til our lives are burning gold

Looking back I see I had the flame in me  
I’m the wind that’s carrying change

I've had enough of chasing luck  
I need, I need a change

I’m setting fire to the life that I know  
Let's start a fire everywhere that we go  
We starting fires, we starting fires  
'Til our lives are burning gold  
'Til our lives are burning gold

I’m setting fire to the life that I know  
Let's start a fire everywhere that we go  
We starting fires, we starting fires  
'Til our lives are burning gold  
'Til our lives are burning gold
