### What I Did for Love歌词：

Talking loud, talking crazy  
Locked me outside  
Prayin' for the rain to come  
Bone dry again  
Guess it's true what they say  
I'm always late  
Say you need a little space  
That I'm in your way  
It hurts, but I remember every scar  
And I've learned  
But living is the hardest part  
I can't believe what I did for love  
I can't believe what I did for us  
Crash and we burn into flames  
Stitch myself up and I'd do it again  
I can't believe what I did for love  
(What I did for love)  
What I did for love  
(What I did for love)  
What I did for us  
(What I did for love)  
What I did for love  
(What I did for love)  
What I did for us  
I'm a fool for your games  
But I always play  
Can't admit it was a waste  
There's too much at stake  
It hurts,  
But I remember every scar  
And I've learned  
But living is the hardest part  
I can't believe what I did for love  
I can't believe what I did for us  
Crash and we burn into flames  
Stitch myself up and I do it again  
I can't believe what I did for love  
(What I did for love)  
What I did for love  
(What I did for love)  
What I did for us  
(What I did for love)  
What I did for love  
(What I did for love)  
I can't believe what I did for love
