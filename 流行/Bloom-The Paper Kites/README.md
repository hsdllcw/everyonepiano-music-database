### Bloom歌词：

In the morning when I wake  
And the sun is coming through  
Oh you fill my lungs with sweetness  
And you fill my head with you  
Shall I write it in a letter  
Shall I try to get it down  
Oh you fill my head with pieces  
Of a song I can't get out  
Can I be close to you  
Ooh oo oo ooh ooh  
Can I be close to you  
Ooh ooh  
Can I take you to a moment  
Where the fields are painted gold  
And the trees are filled with memories  
Of the feelings never told  
When the evening pulls the sun down  
And the day is almost through  
Oh the whole world it is sleeping  
But my world is you  
Can I be close to you  
Ooh ooh aah ooh aah  
Can I be close to you  
Ooh ooh aah ooh aah  
Can I be close to you  
Ooh ooh aah ooh aah  
Can I be close to you  
Ooh ooh aah ooh aah  
Can I be close to you  
Ooh ooh
