### Believe Me歌词：

[Hook - Drake:]  
I'm the only one that get the job done  
I don't know a nigga that can cover for me  
Yeah, got some game from my days  
So she might say she love me  
She don't love me like she say she love me  
Believe me, believe me  
I'm that nigga, boy they love me in the streets  
I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat  
I'm the one they come to see because they all  
Believe me

[Verse 1 - Drake:]  
Yea, uh, rip, rip  
It's been me and Young Tune off the rip  
That's the man that put me in this shit  
If a nigga fuck with him, I'll put him down quick  
Got a verse for anybody wanna talk about the clique  
I've been takin' shit light, you don't wanna hear me trip  
God damn, do y'all really know who you fuckin' with?  
Yeah, I mean you can't blame me for wonderin'  
Doesn't matter, could be winter or the summer  
On the road, I do One Direction numbers, I don't fuckin' miss  
Yeah, Stunna and Mack know  
When Wayne was gone for eight months, we put this thing up on our back  
And I was snappin' off on every single track though  
Collect call from the boss like where we at though  
I was like, "Hah, it's our time, nigga"  
He left Rikers in a Phantom, that's my nigga  
And I've been rockin' with the team, Tha Carter IX  
And we YMCMB, waitin' on somebody to try us, nigga  
Yeah

[Hook - Drake]

[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne:]  
Lord knows I'll murk one of these niggas, yeah  
His and hers Ferraris, nigga  
One for me, one for my daughter, nigga  
Waitin' for someone to test me like a Harvard nigga  
I tote a 223, two Michael Jordans, nigga  
Come on, fight these shell cases like a lawyer, nigga  
Find out where you stay, and act like we found some oil, nigga  
Out of duct tape so when he prayin', I ignore the nigga  
All I gotta say is sayonara, nigga  
Drop dead gorgeous but the bitch ain't dyin' for a nigga  
Where the real queens at? Shout out Capone and Noreaga  
We can shoot it out and see who live to tell the story later  
Diamonds in my Rollie face, cannot be exfoliated  
They think I'm associated, I'm the one that orchestrated  
Yayo get her ass whipped, whip that ass like horses racin'  
Ain't 'bout what you walk away from, it's 'bout what you walk away with  
Dead Presidents, them coffins vacant, I must be doin' somethin'

[Hook - Drake]

[Verse 3 - Drake:]  
Had to get it poppin' off the rip  
Rich young nigga that ain't never had to trick  
Slim Thug flow but you know I like 'em thick  
If she get a job at DOA, I drop her off a tip  
I had to get it poppin' off the rip  
I'm the one they tell ya been reppin' in the 6  
Come into the city and ya niggas get to trippin'?  
We'll take ya to the Scarborough Bluff and drop you off a cliff  
Well damn... just be happy for the man  
Nirvana, Coldplay nigga got bands  
Ink from the money got it all over my hands  
Goin' out to Houston spendin' all of my advance  
V Live just took me for a cheque  
“Drake you know I love you, you just took me outta debt”  
Yes right now you are lookin' at the best  
Mothafuck award shows and mothafuck the press like that!

[Verse 4 - Lil Wayne:]  
Mothafuck the rest  
When they jumped off the porch, I was stumblin' up the steps  
I'd give what I collect before I give up my connect  
It'd be a cold day in Hell, icicles made of sweat  
One finger... slidin' 'cross my neck  
Niggas know what that mean like they deaf  
Nigga I'll fire this nina like it's her first day  
On the job and the bitch overslept  
Tune stay humble, nigga I'm a king  
Need a horn and a drumroll  
They throw mothafuckin' roses at my feet, nigga  
I don't step on one rose  
I'm the only one that get the job done  
I don't know a nigga that can cover for me  
Tape a couple kilos to the bitch stomach  
She look like she got a bun in the oven from me  
Preheat... believe me  
All you gotta do is pay me every week  
I had these bitches havin' babies every week  
I'm the nigga, see me skatin' in the streets  
Gone
