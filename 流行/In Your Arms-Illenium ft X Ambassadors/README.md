### In Your Arms歌词：

Never seen Mona Lisa up close  
But I've seen perfection under your clothes  
Yeah we fell in love and we built a home  
Though we may never see the streets of Rome  
And I hope it's okay  
'Cause the unknown is on it's way  
If I died in your arms  
That's right where I'm supposed to be  
You know I'm not afraid as long as you're next to me  
So tell me will you hold me  
When the curtains close  
If I died in your arms  
That's right where I'm supposed to be  
Yeah we may never sleep under Northern Lights  
But I've seen the stars flicker in your eyes  
And I hope it's okay It's okay  
'Cause the unknown is on it's way  
If I died in your arms  
That's right where I'm supposed to be  
You know I'm not afraid as long as you're next to me  
So tell me will you hold me when the curtains close  
If I died in your arms  
That's right where I'm supposed to be  
It's okay it's okay  
If I died in your arms  
That's right where I'm supposed to be  
It's okay  
It's okay  
Lay me down in the ground by my hometown girl  
We we never leave but it feels like  
We've seen the whole world  
A thousand cheers when the tears on your parents' roof  
Forget my fears every time that I'm under you  
All along all I needed was you  
So I swear I'm not scared when it's over  
If I died in your arms  
That's right where I'm supposed to be  
You know I'm not afraid as long as you're next to me  
So tell me will you hold me when the curtains close  
If I died in your arms  
That's right where I'm supposed to be
