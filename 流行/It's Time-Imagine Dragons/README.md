### It's Time歌词：

So this is what you meant when you said that you were spent?  
终于明白你的意思 当你说心力交瘁  
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit right to the top,  
是时候 从深渊之底开始重建 直达巅峰  
Don't hold back  
不要回头  
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check  
收拾行囊 学业改日再说  
I don't ever want to let you down  
从不想让你失望  
I don't ever want to leave this town  
从不想离开这里  
'Cause after all  
因为不论如何  
This city never sleeps at night...  
这是座不夜城  
It's time to begin, isn't it?  
现在该开始了 不是吗  
I get a little bit bigger, but then, I'll admit  
有些自我膨胀 但还是承认  
I'm just the same as I was  
我还是那个我  
Now don't you understand  
你不会明白  
That I'm never changing who I am.  
我永不改我的本性  
So this is where you fell, and I am left to sell  
所以这就是你跌倒的地方，我会留下来让别人接受  
The path that heaven runs through miles of clouded hell,  
这条穿过阴霾地狱的天堂般的路  
Right to the top  
登上顶峰  
Don't look back  
不要回头  
Turning to rags and give the commodities a rain check  
试着面对那些破烂先别管那些有价值的东西  
I don't ever want to let you down  
从不想让你失望  
I don't ever want to leave this town  
从不想离开这里  
'Cause after all  
因为不论如何  
This city never sleeps at night...  
这是座不夜城  
It's time to begin, isn't it?  
现在该开始了 不是吗  
I get a little bit bigger, but then, I'll admit  
有些自我膨胀 但还是承认  
I'm just the same as I was  
我还是那个我  
Now don't you understand  
你不会明白  
That I'm never changing who I am?  
我永不改我的本性  
It's time to begin, isn't it?  
现在该开始了 不是吗  
I get a little bit bigger, but then, I'll admit  
有些自我膨胀 但还是承认  
I'm just the same as I was  
我还是那个我  
Now don't you understand  
你不会明白  
That I'm never changing who I am?  
我永不改我的本性  
This road never looked so lonely,  
道路从未如此孤单  
This house doesn't burn down slowly,  
房子不要慢慢燃尽  
To ashes, to ashes...  
直到成灰 直到成灰  
It's time to begin, isn't it?  
现在该开始了 不是吗  
I get a little bit bigger, but then, I'll admit  
有些自我膨胀 但还是承认  
I'm just the same as I was
