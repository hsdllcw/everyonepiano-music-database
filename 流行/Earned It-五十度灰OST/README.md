**Earned It双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Earned It_ 是一首由加拿大歌手The Weeknd演唱的歌曲。同时此曲也是美国2015年萨姆•泰勒-
约翰逊执导电影《格雷的五十道阴影/五十度灰》（Fifty Shades of Grey）中的音乐。

歌曲收录在专辑Beauty Behind the Madness中。The
Weeknd的音乐如同被一层薄雾所笼罩，慢节奏下伴随着隆隆的低音以及孤独的回声，The
Weeknd用假音营造出幽幻的气氛。Weeknd对歌曲的采样在R&B界实属罕见，他在歌曲中加入了许多独立摇滚和朋克的元素，Beach House,
Siouxsie，Banshees以及Aaliyah都是他采样的对象，他常用悲伤的歌词来表达受伤的感觉以及对性、毒品和派对等事物的看法。Hermoine
Hoby将the Weeknd的歌曲形象地形容为为“听觉的慢性麻醉药”。

### Earned It歌词：

You make it look like it's magic  
'cause I see nobody, nobody but you, you, you  
I'm never confused  
Hey, hey

I'm so used to being used  
So I love when you call unexpected  
'cause I hate when the moment's expected  
So I'ma care for you, you, you  
I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah  
'cause girl you're perfect  
You're always worth it  
And you deserve it  
The way you work it  
'cause girl you earned it, yeah  
Girl you earned it, yeah

You know our love would be tragic (oh yeah)  
So you don't pay it, don't pay it no mind  
We live with no lies  
Hey, hey  
And you're my favourite kind of night

So I love when you call unexpected  
'cause I hate when the moment's expected  
So I'ma care for you, you, you  
I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah  
'cause girl you're perfect (girl you're perfect)  
You're always worth it (you're always worth it)  
And you deserve it (and you deserve it)  
The way you work it (the way you work it)  
'cause girl you earned it (earned it, yeah)  
Girl you earned it (earned it, yeah)

On that lonely night (lonely night)  
You said it wouldn't be love  
But we felt the rush (felt the love)  
It made us believe it there was only us (only us)  
Convinced we were broken inside, yeah  
Inside, yeah

'cause girl you're perfect (girl you're perfect)  
You're always worth it (you're always worth it)  
And you deserve it (and you deserve it)  
The way you work it (the way you work it)  
'cause girl you earned it (girl you earned it, yeah)  
Girl you earned it (you earned it, yeah)

Nana nana  
So girl you're worth it  
The way you work it  
You deserve it  
I can tell you
