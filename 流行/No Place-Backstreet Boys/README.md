### No Place歌词：

I've been to Paris made my way down to Rome  
Seen the sun setting on the beach in Mexico  
But I could care less 'cause I was all alone  
And there ain't no way to touch your body over the phone  
I've been all around the world done all there is to do  
But you'll always be the home I wanna come home to  
You're a wild night with a hell of a view  
There ain't no place ain't no place like you  
There ain't no place ain't no place like you  
You're my daybreak you're my California sun  
You're my Memphis New York New Orleans all rolled into one  
In the city the country the mountains or sea  
Wherever you are baby that's where I wanna be  
I've been all around the world done all there is to do  
But you'll always be the home I wanna come home to  
You're a wild night with a hell of a view  
There ain't no place ain't no place like you  
There ain't no place ain't no place like you no  
There ain't no place  
No place no place  
Ooh yeah ain't no place  
Wherever you are baby that's where I wanna be  
I've been all around the world done all there is to do  
But you'll always be the home I wanna come home to  
You're a wild night with a hell of a view  
There ain't no place ain't no place like you  
There ain't no place ain't no place like you  
Said there ain't no place ain't no place like you yeah  
There ain't no place  
No place no place  
No place  
There ain't no place like  
No place like you  
No place no place no place no place  
There ain't no place no place like you
