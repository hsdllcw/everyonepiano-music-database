### Slow Dance歌词：

If you stay for this minute  
Girl I'll never let you down  
We ain't off the limit  
I could hold you after now  
No more talking I don't know what you wanna do with that  
If it's good why you even wanna hold it back  
We just work and I know there's no coming back  
Where you at  
Where you at  
Where you at  
I wanna slow dance if you feeling me now  
If we don't hold hands you'll be killing me now  
I need a  
Romance  
One chance  
I just wanna know will you slow dance  
I wanna slow dance if you feeling me now  
If we don't hold hands you'll be killing me now  
We need a  
Romance  
One chance  
I just wanna know will you slow dance  
And do you mind if I say it  
Just wanna have you around  
We take then we give it  
Something lifts us off the ground baby  
No more talk I don't know what you wanna do with that  
If it's good why you even wanna hold it back  
We just work so I know that there's no going back  
Where you at  
Where you at  
Where you at  
I wanna slow dance if you feeling me now  
Feeling me now  
If we don't hold hands you'll be killing me now  
I need a  
Romance  
Romance  
One chance  
One chance  
I just wanna know will you slow dance  
I wanna slow dance if you feeling me now  
Feeling me now  
If we don't hold hands you'll be killing me now  
Killing me now  
We need a  
Romance  
One chance  
One chance  
I just wanna know will you slow dance  
It won't work it won't work it won't work out  
If we don't have a say in this world now  
Taking turns taking turns in this dance now  
I won't forget about you  
I wanna slow dance if you feeling me now  
If we don't hold hands you'll be killing me now  
We need a  
Romance  
One chance  
I just wanna know will you slow dance  
I wanna slow dance if you feeling me now  
If we don't hold hands you'll be killing me now  
We need a  
Romance  
One chance  
One chance  
I just wanna know will you slow dance
