**The Run And Go双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_The Run And Go_ 此曲出自Twenty One Pilots 于2013年1月8日发行的首张厂牌专辑Vessel。Twenty One
Pilots是来自美国俄亥俄州哥伦布的另类摇滚乐队，由泰勒•约瑟夫和乔西•敦组成。其黑色冷峻的音乐基调令听众着迷，主唱特意用了一种飘渺、诡异、冰冷的声音来渲染恐惧，使听者更加不寒而栗。

### The Run And Go歌词：

I can't take them on my own, my own  
我真的快要承受不住了，我快要崩溃了  
Oh, I'm not the one you know, you know  
其实我并不是你所认识的那个人  
I have killed a man and all I know  
我杀了一个人，我现在所知道的是  
Is I am on the run and go.  
我正在逃亡的路上  
Don't wanna call you in the nighttime  
我不想在晚上打电话给你  
Don't wanna give you all my pieces  
我也不想让你了解真正的我  
Don't wanna hand you all my trouble  
我不想给你自造麻烦  
Don't wanna give you all my demons  
我也不想让你知道我邪恶的一面  
You'll have to watch me struggle  
你也只能看着我这样挣扎着  
From several rooms away  
就这样远远的看着  
But tonight I'll need you to stay.  
但是今晚，我需要你留下来  
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do.

I am up against the wall, the wall  
我现在处境的已经十分艰难了  
For I hear them coming down the hall  
因为他快要占据我了

Cold nights under siege from accusations  
自己就快要被这寒冷的夜晚吞噬了  
Cerebral thunder in one-way conversations  
两种声音不停地对质着，脑袋就快要裂开了
