### Lemonade歌词：

Through heaven and hell  
That’s what you said  
Through sickness and health  
That’s what you said  
Cause no one knows what we been through  
That’s what you said  
And no one knows me like you do  
That’s what you said  
No matter  
I coulda waited for someone to come around  
For someone who wouldn’t leave a bad taste in my mouth  
But life gave me you and I made  
Lemonade, lemonade, lemonade, lemonade, lemonade, lemonade  
I pucker my lips, you could be pretty sour  
Add sugar and water, just something to wash it down  
Cause life gave me you and I made  
Lemonade, lemonade , lemonade , lemonade , lemonade, lemonade  
For better or worse  
That’s what you said  
From propose to hearse  
That’s what you said  
Cause no one knows what we been through  
That’s what you said  
And no one knows me like you do  
That’s what you said  
No matter  
I coulda waited for someone to come around  
For someone who wouldn’t leave a bad taste in my mouth  
But life gave me you and I made  
Lemonade, lemonade, lemonade, lemonade, lemonade, lemonade  
I pucker my lips, you could be pretty sour  
Add sugar and water, just something to wash it down  
Cause life gave me you and I made  
Lemonade, lemonade , lemonade , lemonade , lemonade, lemonade  
Nobody’s perfect, no  
We’re tryin' the best we can  
And the pain its so often, oh  
From the moments like this  
When you’re holding my hand  
And you’re kissing all over my shoulders  
Down to my thighs  
I haven’t told you why, But you don’t see who I am inside  
Cause you believed and preconceived this love was born again, you’re that
paranoid, yeah  
But paradise is on the table  
Just let me show you how sweet this life can be  
I coulda waited for someone to come around  
For someone who wouldn’t leave a bad taste in my mouth  
But life gave me you and I made  
Lemonade, lemonade, lemonade, lemonade, lemonade, lemonade  
I pucker my lips, you could be pretty sour  
Add sugar and water, just something to wash it down  
Cause life gave me you and I made  
Lemonade, lemonade , lemonade , lemonade , lemonade, lemonade
