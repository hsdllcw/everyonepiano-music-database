### Love歌词：

Look at you kids with your vintage music  
Comin' through satellites while cruisin'  
You're part of the past, but now you're the future  
Signals crossing can get confusing  
It's enough just to make you feel crazy, crazy, crazy  
Sometimes, it's enough just to make you feel crazy  
You get ready, you get all dressed up  
To go nowhere in particular  
Back to work or the coffee shop  
Doesn't matter cause it's enough  
To be young and in love (Ah, ah)  
To be young and in love (Ah, ah)  
Look at you kids, you know you're the coolest  
The world is yours and you can't refuse it  
Seen so much, you could get the blues  
But that don't mean that you should abuse it  
Though it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy  
I know, it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy  
But you get ready, you get all dressed up  
To go nowhere in particular  
Back to work or the coffee shop  
It don't matter cause it's enough  
To be young and in love (Ah, ah)  
To be young and in love (Ah, ah)  
Hmm (Ah, ah)  
Hmm (Ah, ah)  
Hmm  
Don't worry, baby  
Hmm (Ah, ah)  
Hmm (Ah, ah)  
Hmm  
Don't worry, baby  
And it's enough just to make me go crazy, crazy, crazy  
It's enough just to make me go crazy, crazy, crazy  
I get ready, I get all dressed up  
To go nowhere in particular  
It doesn't matter if I'm not enough  
For the future or the things to come  
'Cause I'm young and in love (Ah, ah)  
I'm young and in love (Ah, ah)  
Hmm (Ah, ah)  
Hmm (Ah, ah)  
Hmm  
Don't worry, baby  
Hmm (Ah, ah)  
Hmm (Ah, ah)  
Hmm  
Don't worry, baby
