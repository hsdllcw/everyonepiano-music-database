### Lying Down歌词：

Oh I didn't mean to fall in deep  
But I've no regrets  
You tried to push me down you tried to keep me possessed  
I gave you my heart you took the key  
But now I paid my debt  
It's time I left  
And I don't need someone who makes me feel so bad  
And I've just enough left to help me pack my bags  
Yes I have found something I thought I lost  
I found me I found faith I found trust  
You can't take this from me  
Can't you see I won't take this lying down  
And I can hear you when you speak your poison  
Bitter words can't hurt me now I won't take it lying down  
All it takes is one bold move to change everything  
All it takes is loving you to forget forgive  
But I'm having some kind of breakthrough  
I'm ready to live  
And I don't need someone who makes me feel so bad  
And I've just enough left to help me pack my bags  
Yes I have found something I thought I lost  
I found me I found faith I found trust  
You can't take this from me  
Can't you see I won't take this lying down  
And I can hear you when you speak your poison  
Bitter words can't hurt me now I won't take it lying down  
I won't take it lying down  
I won't take it lying down  
I won't take it lying down  
I won't take it lying down  
You can't take this from me  
Can't you see I won't take this lying down  
And I can hear you when you speak your poison  
Bitter words can't hurt me now I won't take it lying down  
I won't take it lying down  
I won't take it lying down  
I won't take it lying down  
I won't take it lying down
