**My Hair** 出自美国女歌手Ariana
Grande的第六张录音室专辑《Positions》。专辑更倾向于制作人汤米•布朗的灵魂感化作品，让人回想起爱莉安娜•格兰德的首张录音室专辑《Yours
Truly》，但将其与更多的成人内容融合在一起。

《 _My Hair_
》以爵士吉他艾米•怀恩豪斯的《Frank》开始，然后进入Grande渴望被触碰的悠闲状态。就在听众以为这首慢燃的歌曲达到了顶点时，Grande却发出了一个哨音。总之，非常好听！

### My Hair歌词：

Said I'm gon' give you some instructions  
That you can't be scared to try  
I want you to touch it softly  
Like the way you do my mind  
It got body and it's smooth to touch  
The same way as my skin  
But don't you be scared  
To run your hands through my hair  
Baby 'cause that why it's there  
Come run your hands through my hair  
Oh baby said don't you be scared  
So come run your hands through my hair  
It's been way long overdue  
Just like these inches down my back  
Usually don't let people touch it  
But tonight you'll get a pass  
Spend my dimes and spend my time  
To keep it real sometimes it's tracks  
But I don't care mmm  
So run your hands through my hair  
Baby 'cause that why it's there  
Come run your hands through my hair  
Oh baby said don't you be scared  
So come run your hands through my hair  
Know this ain't usually mе  
But I might let it down for ya mmm  
This ain't usually me usually me  
But I might let it down for ya  
So come run your hands through my hair  
So run your hands through my hair  
Baby 'cause that why it's there  
So come run your hands through my hair  
Oh don't you be scared  
Come run your hands through my hair  
Oh-oh oh-oh  
Oh-oh oh-oh
