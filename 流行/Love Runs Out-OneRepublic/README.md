### Love Runs Out歌词：

I'll be your light, your match, your burning sun  
I'll be the bright and black that's making you run  
And I feel alright, and we'll feel alright  
'Cause we'll work it out, yeah we'll work it out  
I'll be doin' this, if you ever doubt

'til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out  
I'll be your ghost, your game, your stadium  
I'll be your fin, deep down, entrapped like one  
And I feel alright, and I feel alright  
'Cause I worked it out, yeah I worked it out  
I'll be doin' this, if you ever doubt  
'til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out  
I got my mind made up and I can't let go  
I'm killing every second 'til it sees my soul  
I'll be running, I'll be running

'til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out  
And we'll start a fire, and we'll shut it down  
'til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out  
There's a maniac out in front of me  
Got an angel on my shoulder, and Mephistopheles  
My momma raised me good, momma raised me right  
Momma said "do what you want, say prayers at night"  
And I'm saying them, cause I'm so devout  
'Til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out, yeah  
I got my mind made up and I can't let go  
I'm killing every second 'til it sees my soul  
I'll be running, I'll be running  
'til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out  
And we'll start a fire, and we'll shut it down  
'til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out

Ooh, we all want the same thing

Ooh, we all run for something  
Oh for God, for fate  
For love, for hate  
For gold, and rust  
For diamonds, and dust  
I'll be our light, your match, your burning sun  
I'll be the bright and black that's making you run  
I got my mind made up and I can't let go  
I'm killing every second 'til it sees my soul  
I'll be running, I'll be running  
'til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out  
And we'll start a fire, and we'll shut it down  
'til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out  
I'll be your light, your match, your burning sun  
I'll be the bright and black that's making you run  
And I feel alright, and we'll feel alright  
'Cause we'll work it out, yeah we'll work it out  
And we'll start a fire, and we'll shut it down  
'til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out  
'Til the love runs out
