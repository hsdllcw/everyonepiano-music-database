Coldplay 于2021年5月7日发布了全新歌曲《 **Higher Power** 》，并收录在即将推出的第九张录音室专辑《Music Of The
Spheres》当中。在歌曲推出前，Coldplay
早已暗示新作与外太空有关，预告中可以看到一系列神秘符号，并指向名为「alienradio.fm」的外星电台。相信谁都想不到他们今次竟与位于国际太空站的法国太空人
Thomas Pesquet 进行新曲首播，名符其实的「扬威宇宙」。

在《 _Higher Power_ 》首播之际，Coldplay 与 Thomas Pesquet
进行了跨越星球的对话，閒聊新曲、地球现时的状况以及外太空的日常趣事。当中更包括一些发人省思的对话，主音 Chris Martin
讲述地球的状况，同时亦问道关于太空人 Thomas 对地球以及人类的看法。Thomas
表示，在太空看不到地球有任何地域边界，只能看到海和山等大自然景观，亦让他深深感受到地球的渺小和脆弱。他继续说道：「在地球上的时候，我们看到的景观通常都会是异常巨大，不过在太空就能很清楚明白这是一个球状的绿洲。我们拥有的一切都在这个星球上，所以人类必须懂得善用地球的资源，互相分享和合作。」正如《Higher
Power》所表达的歌词一样，传递正能量给每一位歌迷。

同时，网站还为大家提供了《[ **Something Just Like This**](Music-7553-Something-Just-Like-

### Higher Power歌词：

Sometimes I just can't take it  
Sometimes I just can't take it  
And it isn't alright  
I'm not going to make it  
And I think my shoe is untied  
I'm like a broken record  
I'm like a broken record  
And I'm not playing right  
Just wanna go up higher can we  
Till you tell me I'm a heavenly photo  
Hold tight  
Hold tight  
Come on  
Come on  
Come on  
Come on  
Woah  
Come on  
Come on

Come on  
Don't let go  
Hold tight  
Hold tight  
Hold tight  
Hold tight  
Woah  
It's alright it's alright  
You said  
I've got my hands up  
Shaking just to let you know  
That you've got a higher power  
Got me singing every second  
Dancing every hour  
Oh yeah  
You'vе got a higher power  
And you're really someone  
I want to know  
Oh  
This boy is electric  
Ooh  
This boy is electric and you're sparkling like  
The universe connected  
And I'm buzzing  
Night after night after night  
This joy is electric  
This joy is electric and you're circuiting through  
I'm so happy that I'm alive  
Happy I'm alive at the same time as you  
'Cause you've got a higher power  
Got me singing every second  
Dancing every hour  
Oh yeah  
You've got a higher power  
And you're really someone  
I want to know

Got me singing every second  
Dancing every hour

Once in a lifetime  
I'm going a million miles an hour  
And for so long  
I've been down on my knees  
To your love song  
Floats me over and over  
For so long  
I've been down on my knees  
To your love song  
Floats me oh
