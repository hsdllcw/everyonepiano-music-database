### Hold On We're Going Home歌词：

演唱：Drake

I got my eyes on you, you're everything that I see  
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly  
I can't get over you, you left your mark on me  
I want your high love and emotion endlessly  
Cause you're a good girl and you know it  
You act so different around me  
Cause you're a good girl and you know it  
I know exactly who you could be  
Just hold on we're going home  
Just hold on we're going home  
It's hard to do these things alone  
Just hold on we're going home  
I got my eyes on you, you're everything that I see  
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly  
I can't get over you, you left your mark on me  
I want your high love and emotion endlessly  
Cause you're a good girl and you know it  
You act so different around me  
Cause you're a good girl and you know it  
I know exactly who you could be  
Just hold on we're going home  
Just hold on we're going home  
It's hard to do these things alone  
Just hold on we're going home  
You're the girl, you're the one  
Gave you everything I love  
I think there's something, baby  
I think there's something, baby  
You're the girl, you're the one  
Gave you everything I love  
I think there's something, baby  
I think there's something, baby  
Cause you're a good girl and you know it,  
You act so different around me,  
Cause you're a good girl and you know it,  
I know exactly who you could be  
Just hold on we're going home  
Just hold on we're going home  
It's hard to do these things alone  
Just hold on we're going home
