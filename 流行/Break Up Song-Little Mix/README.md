### Break Up Song歌词：

This is not a second chance no no baby  
This is not a new romance not tonight uh uh uh  
This is for all the nights I cried for ya baby  
Hoping you could be the one that could love me right  
I'll be good all by myself  
Yeah I'll find a way to dance without you  
In the middle of the crowd  
I'll forget all of the pain inside oh  
So tonight I'll sing another another break up song  
So turn it up and let it play on and on and on and on  
Of all of the time they screwed us over  
And let it play on and on and on and on  
It's just another break up song  
Ain't no more tears  
Ain't gonna cry  
Boy I'll do anything to get you off my mind  
I'm gonna dance  
Under the lights  
Boy I'll do anything to get you off my mind  
I ain't even gonna call ya no baby  
The best thing I ever did was to let you go uh uh uh  
Did you think you were the only one who could save me  
I ain't gonna take you back like I did before no  
Cos I'll be good all by myself  
Yeah I'll find a way to dance without you  
In the middle of the crowd  
I'll forget all of the pain inside oh  
So tonight I'll sing another another break up song  
So turn it up and let it play on and on and on and on  
Of all of the time they screwed us over  
And let it play on and on and on and on  
It's just another break up song  
Ain't no more tears  
Ain't gonna cry  
Boy I'll do anything to get you off my mind  
I'm gonna dance  
Under the lights  
Boy I'll do anything to get you off my mind  
I don't wanna turn back time  
Cos what's another lonely night  
I know under these lights I'm good without you  
For all those tears that I cried  
I sing it louder tonight  
Let it play on and on and on and on  
So tonight I'll sing another another break up song  
So turn it up and let it play on and on and on and on  
Of all of the time they screwed us over  
And let it play on and on and on and on  
It's just another break up song  
I don't wanna turn back time  
Cos what's another lonely night  
I know under these lights I'm good without you  
For all those tears that I cried  
I sing it louder tonight  
Let it play on and on and on and on  
It's just another break up song
