### Whoopty歌词：

Heavy on the S S O man  
Loyalty over royalty y'all know the vibes  
Pxcoyo killed this beat  
Whoopty  
I'm outside it's a movie whoopty huh  
Blue cheese  
I swear I'm addicted to blue cheese  
I gotta stick to this paper like loose leaf  
I'm 'bout my chicken like it's a two-piece  
You can have your back she a groupie  
She just swallowed all my kids in the two-seat gag  
Swagged out  
For Milly we bringing them gats out  
I still got some racks stuffed in the trap house  
Off the forty two I'm blowing her back out  
I'm back on my bull swing back with a full clip  
They say I'm moving ruthless  
And my shooters they shootin'  
I won't take her to Ruth's Chris  
I get the breesh then it's adios  
If I'm with your treesh then she's giving yeah  
When I see police then we getting low  
That's another piece that's another Zoe  
Ice in the V V's now she's down to get treeshy  
I got all this water on me like Fiji  
I'm posted up with Hats and the Sleezys  
Smokin' the Zaza it goes straight to the matha  
Then I'm uppin' the choppa  
Hittin' the cha-cha open his lata  
Then he dancin' bachata  
Smokin' the Zaza it goes straight to the matha  
Then I'm uppin' the choppa  
Hittin' the cha-cha then I open his lata  
Then he dancin' bachata  
Whoopty  
I'm outside it's a movie huh  
Blue cheese  
I swear I'm addicted to blue cheese  
I gotta stick to this paper like loose leaf  
I'm 'bout my chicken like it's a two-piece  
You can have your back she a groupie  
She just all my kids in the two-seat gag  
Swagged out  
For Milly we bringing them gats out  
I still got some racks stuffed in the trap house  
Off the forty two I'm blowing her back out  
I'm back on my bull swing back with a full clip  
They say I'm moving ruthless  
And my shooters they shootin'  
I won't take her to Ruth's Chris  
They shootin' ayy  
Swagged out  
For Milly we bringing them gats out  
I still got some racks stuffed in the trap house  
Off the forty two I'm blowing her back out  
I'm back on my bull swing back with a full clip  
They say I'm moving ruthless  
And my shooters they shootin'  
I won't take her to Ruth's Chris  
They shootin' ayy
