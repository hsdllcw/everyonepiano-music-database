### Art Deco歌词：

Club queen on the downtown scene  
Prowling around at night  
You're not mean, you're just born to be seen  
Born to be wild  
A little party never hurt no one, that's why it's alright  
You want in but you just can't win  
So you hang in the lights

You're so Art Deco, out on the floor  
Shining like gun metal, cold and unsure  
Baby, you're so ghetto  
You're looking to score  
When they all say hello  
You try to ignore them  
Cause you want more (why?)  
You want more (why?)  
You want more (why?)  
Cause you want more

Young thing on the downtown scene  
Rolling around at night  
Got things, that have yet to be seen  
Like your rapper's delight  
A little party never hurt no one, that's why it's alright  
You want in, but you just can't win  
So you stay in the lights

You're so Art Deco, out on the floor  
Shining like gun metal, cold and unsure  
Baby, you're so ghetto  
You're looking to score  
When they all say hello  
You try to ignore them  
Cause you want more (why?)  
You want more (why?)  
You want more (why?)  
Cause you want more

A little party never hurt no one  
So you stay out late  
A little party never hurt no one  
That's what your friends say  
You put your life out on the line  
You're crazy all the time  
Put your life out on the line  
You're crazy all the time

You're so Art Deco, out on the floor  
Shining like gun metal, cold and unsure  
Baby, you're so ghetto  
You're looking to score  
When they all say hello  
You try to ignore them  
Cause you want more (why?)  
You want more (why?)  
You want more (why?)  
Cause you want more

A little party never hurt no one  
Not you and me  
A little party never hurt no one  
We were born to be free
