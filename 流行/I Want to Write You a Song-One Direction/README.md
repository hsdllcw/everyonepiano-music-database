### I Want to Write You a Song歌词：

[Harry:]  
I want to write you a song  
One as beautiful as you are sweet  
With just a hint of pain  
For the feeling that I get when you are gone  
I want to write you a song

[Liam:]  
I want to lend you my coat  
One that's as soft as your cheek  
So when the world is cold  
You'll have a hiding place you can go  
I want to lend you my coat

[Louis:]  
Oooh, everything I need I get from you  
Oooh, givin' back is all I wanna do

[Liam:]  
I want to build you a boat  
One as strong as you are free  
So any time you think that your heart is gonna sink  
You know it won't  
I want to build you a boat

[Louis:]  
Oooh, everything I need I get from you  
Oooh, givin' back is all I wanna do

[Harry:]  
Oooh, everything I need I get from you  
Oooh, givin' back is all I wanna do

[Niall:]  
I want to write you a song  
One to make your heart remember me  
So any time I'm gone  
You can listen to my voice and sing along  
I want to write you a song  
I want to write you a song
