### Grace歌词：

I'm not ready to be just another of your mistakes  
I can't seem to drown you out long enough  
I fell victim to the sound of your love  
You're like a song that I ain't ready to stop  
I got nothing but you on my mind  
I'm not ready to be just another of your mistakes  
Don't wanna let the pieces fall out of place  
I was only just a breath removed from going to waste  
'Till I found salvation in the form of your  
Your grace  
Your grace  
Your grace  
Don't take it away  
Your grace  
Your grace  
Your grace  
Don't take it away  
On the verge of almost bleeding you out  
Are we too wounded now to ever come down  
Oh how I long for us to find common ground  
I got nothing but you on my mind  
I'm not ready to be just another of your mistakes  
Don't wanna let the pieces fall out of place  
I was only just a breath removed from going to waste  
'Till I found salvation in the form of your  
Your grace  
Your grace  
Your grace  
Don't take it away  
Your grace  
Your grace  
Your grace  
Don't take it take it  
Way too close to colour your comfort  
All dressed up but kept undercover  
Way too close to colour your comfort  
All dressed up but kept undercover  
Your grace  
Your grace  
Your grace  
Don't take it away  
I'm not ready to be just another of your mistakes  
Don't wanna let the pieces fall out of place  
I was only just a breath removed from going to waste  
'Till I found salvation in the form of your  
Your grace your grace  
Your grace your grace  
Your grace your grace  
Don't take it away  
Your grace your grace  
Your grace your grace  
Your grace  
Don't take it away
