### Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)歌词：

The snow's coming down  
I'm watching it fall  
Lots of people around  
Baby please come home  
The church bells in town  
All singing in song  
Full of happy sounds  
Baby please come home  
They're singing Deck The Halls  
But it's not like Christmas at all  
'Cause I remember when you were here  
And all the fun we had last year  
Pretty lights on the tree  
I'm watching them shine  
You should be here with me  
Baby please come home  
They're singing Deck The Halls  
But it's not like Christmas at all  
'Cause I remember when you were here  
And all the fun we had last year  
If there was a way  
I'd hold back this tear  
But it's Christmas day  
Please  
Please  
Please  
Please  
Please  
Please  
Baby please come home  
Baby please come home  
Baby please come home  
Baby please come home  
Oh yeah  
Baby please come home  
Please come home
