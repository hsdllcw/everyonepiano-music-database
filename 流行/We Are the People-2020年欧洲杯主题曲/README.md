Martin Garrix和Bono / The Edge史诗级的联手推出2020年欧洲杯主题曲《 **We Are The People**
》，比赛精神与progressive house的电音风格绝对是最佳搭配！

不管是Martin Garrix完美的底音铺垫，或是Bono / The
Edge撩拨心弦的嗓音，都让人感到心动不已，仿佛于山林从野漫步是微凉的夏风和蝉鸣。慵懒的男音在耳边小声呢喃细语，宛若清风绕指，夏天的晚风残云，余热未尽的沙滩，海浪摇碎温柔，融于汪洋恣肆。在沙滩留下的足迹被海浪抹去，这星海浪潮，但愿有人陪你倾听。

### We Are the People歌词：

We're a million volts in a pool of light  
Electricity in the room tonight  
Born from fire sparks flying from the sun  
Hey I hardly know you can I confess  
I feel your heart beating in my chest  
If you come with me tonight is gonna be the one  
Cause you've faith and no fear for the fight  
You pull hope from defeat in the night  
There's an image of you in my mind  
Could be mad but you might just be right  
We are the people we've been waiting for  
Out of the ruins of hate and war  
Army of lovers never seen before  
We are the people we've been waiting for  
We are the people of the open hand  
Streets of dublin to notre dame  
We'll build it better than we did before  
We are the people we've been waiting for  
We are the people we've been waiting for  
Broken bells and a broken church  
A heart that hurts is a heart that works  
From a broken place that's where the victory's won  
Cause you've faith and no fear for the fight  
You pull hope from defeat in the night  
There's an image of you in my mind  
Could be mad but you might just be right  
We are the people we've been waiting for  
Out of the ruins of hate and war  
Army of lovers never seen before  
We are the people we've been waiting for  
We are the people of the open hand  
Streets of dublin to notre dame  
We'll build it better than we did before  
We are the people we've been waiting for  
We are the people we've been waiting for
