**Higher Ground** 是Martin Garrix与瑞典歌手John Martin的全新单曲。

“独行于忽略时间纬度的节点，才知这是热爱与生命的山巅。”在Martin Garrix二十四岁生日发布的这首《 _Higher Ground_
》意义非凡，也能从很多角度看出Martin对它的重视。
舒缓平静的intro很快步入了有男声加入的部分，有穿透力的声音仿佛站在山巅最高处一般群览万物。反复式的旋律和富有质感的Vocal覆盖了前半部分。无限推进PHouse的drop有动有静，而整段旋律一直冲刺到尾声部分。整体旷阔的声线和弱化的鼓声让整首曲子十分明朗，并对未来展开无限遐想。
也许生命的意义就在于探索和前进，追求更好的人生与境界。这大概也是Martin的抱负和继续奋斗的信念吧。

### Higher Ground歌词：

All this time all this time keeps fading  
Feeling trapped inside  
So afraid of the darkness talking  
In my mind  
It's been a long time coming  
But it wasn't for nothing  
Soul searching for something for something  
I'm down on my knees in the dust  
I scream from the top of my lungs  
I find my way back to a higher ground  
Yeah I just want to feel alive  
Deep in my bones  
I know I'm not there but I'm close  
I'll find my way back to a higher ground  
Yeah I just want to feel alive with you  
Yeah I just want to feel alive with you  
Yeah I just want to feel alive  
Try to speak but my voice keeps breaking  
Need to say what's wrong  
So many smiles you have seen me faking  
On and on  
It's been a long time coming  
But it wasn't for nothing  
Soul searching for something for something  
I'm down on my knees in the dust  
I scream from the top of my lungs  
I find my way back to a higher ground  
Yeah I just want to feel alive  
Deep in my bones  
I know I'm not there but I'm close  
I'll find my way back to a higher ground  
Yeah I just want to feel alive with you  
Yeah I just want to feel alive with you  
Yeah I just want to feel alive  
With you you yeah  
I just want to feel alive  
With you you yeah  
I just want to feel alive with you
