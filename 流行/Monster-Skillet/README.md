**Monster** 是来自美国Memphis的著名Christian Rock乐队Skillet的歌曲。乐队，1996年组建，由John
Copper主唱兼贝斯手，他的妻子Korey Cooper吉他兼键盘手，Basica吉他手，Jen Ledger鼓手组成。

  
乐队以健康歌词和积极向上的态度来得到基督教听众认识和喜爱，这也是Christian
Rock的本质(当然可以有多种多样的风格了)。他们的歌词往往是很容易融入旋律，可以让失落的灵魂寻找一些精神的力量，在这方面，Skillet要比其他Christian
Rock如Pillar要做的好的多，乐队偏向金属而不失前卫的做法也得到其他乐队的借鉴，可以说也是Christian Rock典型代表人物。

### Monster歌词：

The secret side of me I never let you see  
I keep it caged, but I can't control it  
So stay away from me, the beast is ugly  
I feel the rage and I just can't hold it

It's scratching on the walls, in the closet, in the halls  
It comes awake, and I can't control it  
Hiding under the bed, in my body, in my head  
Why won't somebody come and save me from this, make it end.

I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin  
I must confess that I feel like a monster  
I hate what I've become, the nightmare's just begun  
I must confess that I feel like a monster

I, I feel like a monster.  
I, I feel like a monster.

My secret side I keep hid under lock and key  
I keep it caged, but I can't control it  
'Cause if I let him out he'll tear me up, break me down  
Why won't somebody come and save me from this, make it end.

I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin  
I must confess that I feel like a monster  
I hate what I've become, the nightmare's just begun  
I must confess that I feel like a monster.

I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin  
I must confess that I feel like a monster  
I, I feel like a monster  
I, I feel like a monster

It's hiding in the dark, it's teeth are razor sharp  
There's no escape for me, it wants my soul, it wants my heart  
No one can hear me scream, maybe it's just a dream  
Maybe it's inside of me, stop this monster

I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin  
I must confess that I feel like a monster  
I hate what I've become, the nightmare's just begun  
I must confess that I feel like a monster

I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin  
I must confess that I feel like a monster  
I've gotta lose control, he something radical  
I must confess that I feel like a monster

I, I feel like a monster  
I, I feel like a monster  
I, I feel like a monster  
I, I feel like a monster.
