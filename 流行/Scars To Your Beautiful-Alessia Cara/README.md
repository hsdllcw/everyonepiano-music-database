### Scars To Your Beautiful歌词：

She just wants to be beautiful  
She goes unnoticed she knows no limits  
She craves attention she praises an image  
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor  
Oh she don't see the light that's shining  
Deeper than the eyes can find it  
Maybe we have made her blind  
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away  
Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made  
But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark  
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are  
And you don't have to change a thing  
The world could change its heart  
No scars to your beautiful we're stars and we're beautiful  
Oh  
And you don't have to change a thing  
The world could change its heart  
No scars to your beautiful we're stars and we're beautiful  
She has dreams to be an envy so she's starving  
You know covergirls eat nothing  
She says beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything  
What's a little bit of hunger  
I could go a little while longer she fades away  
She don't see her perfect she don't understand she's worth it  
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface  
So to all the girls that's hurting  
Let me be your mirror help you see a little bit clearer  
The light that shines within  
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark  
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are  
And you don't have to change a thing  
The world could change its heart  
No scars to your beautiful we're stars and we're beautiful  
And you don't have to change a thing  
The world could change its heart  
No scars to your beautiful we're stars and we're beautiful  
No better you than the you that you are  
No better you than the you that you are  
No better life than the life we're living  
No better life than the life we're living  
No better time for your shine you're a star  
No better time for your shine you're a star  
Oh you're beautiful oh you're beautiful  
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark  
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are  
And you don't have to change a thing  
The world could change its heart  
No scars to your beautiful we're stars and we're beautiful  
And you don't have to change a thing  
The world could change its heart  
No scars to your beautiful we're stars and we're beautiful
