### More Than Friends歌词：

Jason Mraz：  
It feels like we've been friends forever yeah  
And we always see eye to eye  
The more time we spend together  
And the more I wanna say what's on my mind  
Take it easy  
'Cause it ain't easy to say  
I wanna be more than friends  
I wanna be more than friends  
I wanna tell everyone you're taken  
And take your hand until the end  
I wanna be more than friends  
Meghan Trainor：  
At the risk of sounding foolish  
I don't wanna fool around no more  
If we're gonna do this then let's do this  
You can fix my broken heart if it's all yours  
Both：  
So take it easy  
'Cause it ain't easy to say  
I wanna be more than friends  
I wanna be more than friends  
I wanna tell everyone you're taken  
And take your hand until the end  
I wanna be more than friends  
I'm asking you to be my baby  
I'm giving you my heart don't break it  
I'm crushing and I'm going crazy  
Either way I know we'll make it  
Take it easy  
It ain't easy to say  
I'll take it easy  
I'll take it easy  
It ain't easy to say  
I wanna be more than friends  
I wanna be more than friends  
I wanna tell everyone you're taken  
And take your hand until the end  
I wanna be more than friends friends  
I'm asking you to be my baby  
Asking you to be my baby  
I'm giving you my heart don't break it  
Giving you my heart don't break it  
I'm crushing and I'm going crazy  
Hey  
Either way I know we'll make it  
I know I know I know we'll make it
