**Male Fantasy** 由美国女歌手Billie Eilish演唱，收录于2021年7月30日发行的专辑《Happier Than
Ever》，也是该专辑的结束曲。

专辑以这首忧郁的民谣结束，Billie反思了最近的一次心碎。她在这首歌的开头提到了Male Fantasy，以强调真爱和假爱之间的区别。

_Male Fantasy_
中Billie将自己代入男性，用第一人称把男性幻想用轻快的旋律和平静的歌词表现出来。看得出来Billie的想法真的天马行空且富有创意。

### Male Fantasy歌词：

Home alone tryin' not to eat  
Distract myself with pornography  
I hate the way she looks at me  
I can't stand the dialogue she would never be  
That satisfied it's a male fantasy  
I'm goin' back to therapy  
'Cause I loved you then  
And I love you now and I don't know how  
Guess it's hard to know  
When nobody else comes around  
If I'm getting over you  
Or just pretending to  
Be alright convince myself I hate you  
Want me to sing in here  
I got a call from a girl I used to know  
We were inseparablе years ago  
Thought we'd get along but it wasn't so  
And it's all I think about whеn I'm behind the wheel  
I worry this is how I'm always gonna feel  
But nothing lasts I know the deal  
But I loved you then  
And I love you now and I don't know how  
Guess it's hard to know  
When nobody else comes around  
If I'm getting over you  
Or just pretending to  
Be alright convince myself I hate you  
Can't get over you  
No matter what I do  
I know I should but I could never hate you
