### Never Forget You歌词：

I used to be so happy  
But without you here I feel so low  
I watched you as you left but I can never seem to let you go  
'Cause once upon a time you were my everything  
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing  
It's buried deep inside me but I feel there's something you should know

I will never forget you  
You'll always be by my side  
From the day that I met you  
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die  
And I will never want much more  
And in my heart I will always be sure  
I will never forget you  
And you will always be by my side 'til the day I die

'Til the day I die ('til the day I die)  
'Til the day I die ('til the day I die)

[MNEK:]  
Funny how we both end up here but everything seems alright  
I wonder what would happen  
If we went back and put up a fight  
'Cause once upon a time you were my everything  
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing  
So what in this world do you think could ever take you off my mind (take you
off my mind)

[Zara Larsson:]  
I will never forget you  
And you'll always be by my side  
From the day that I met you  
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die  
And I will never want much more  
And in my heart I will always be sure  
I will never forget you  
And you'll always be by my side 'til the day I die

[Both:]  
Feeling it, loving it  
Everything that we do  
And all along, I knew I had something special with you  
But sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through  
But I'm still tired and I can't hide my connection with you

Feeling it, loving it  
Everything that we do  
And all along, I knew I had something special with you  
But sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through  
I can't hide my connection with you

I will never forget you  
And you'll always be by my side  
From the day that I met you  
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die  
And I will never want much more  
And in my heart I will always be sure  
That I will never forget you  
And you'll always be by my side 'til the day I die

'Til the day I die... [6x]

I will never forget you...

'Til the day I die.
