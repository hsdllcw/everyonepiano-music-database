### Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood歌词：

Baby, you understand me now?  
If sometimes you see that I'm mad  
Don't you know, no one alive can always be an angel?  
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good  
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

You know sometimes, baby, I'm so carefree  
With a joy that's hard to hide  
And then sometimes, again, it seems that all I have is worry  
And then you're bound to see my other side

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good  
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem edgy  
I want you to know  
I never meant to take it out on all you  
Life has its problems  
And I get more than my share  
But that's one thing I never mean to do

Cause I love you  
Oh baby, I'm just human  
Don't you know I have faults like anyone?  
Sometimes I find myself alone regretting  
Some little foolish thing  
Some simple thing that I've done

Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good  
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

I try so hard, don't let me be misunderstood  
I try so hard, don't let me be misunderstood
