Why you always in a mood f**kin 'round actin' brand new  
I ain't tryna tell you what to do but try to play it cool  
Baby I ain't playing by your rules  
Everything look better with a view  
Why you always in a mood f**kin 'round actin' brand new  
I ain't tryna tell you what to do but try to play it cool  
Baby I ain't playing by your rules  
Everything look better with a view yeah  
Iann dior：  
I could never get attached  
When I start to feel I unattach  
Somehow I always end up feeling bad  
Baby I am not your dad it's not all you want from me  
I just want your company  
Girl it's obvious elephant in the room  
And we're a part of it don't act so confused  
And you love startin' it now I'm in a mood  
Now we arguin' in my bedroom

We play games of love to avoid the depression  
We been here before and I won't be your victim

24kGoldn：  
So why you tryin' to fake your love on the regular  
When you could be blowin' up just like my cellular  
I won't ever let a shorty go and set me up  
Only thing I need to know is if you wet enough  
I'm talking slick back kick back gang sippin' fourties  
You keep playin not another day with you shorty  
Mismatched fits that was way before you know me  
Got a lot of love well you better save it for me

We play games of love to avoid the depression  
We been here before and I won't be your victim

I ain't tryna tell you what to do but try to play it cool  
Baby I ain't playing by your rules  
Everything look better with a view  
Why you always in a mood f**kin 'round actin' brand new  
I ain't tryna tell you what to do but try to play it cool  
Baby I ain't playing by your rules  
Everything look better with a view yeah
