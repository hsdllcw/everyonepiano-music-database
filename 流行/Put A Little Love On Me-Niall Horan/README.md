### Put A Little Love On Me歌词：

We fight we get high holding on to love  
We came down 'cause there was nothing holding us  
Is it wrong that I still wonder where you are  
Is it wrong that I still don't know my heart  
Are you all dressed up but with nowhere to go  
Are your tears falling down when the lights are low  
Another Friday night tryna put on a show  
Do you hate the weekend 'cause nobody's calling  
I've still got so much love hidden beneath this skin  
So darling  
Put a little love on me put a little love on me  
When the lights come up and there's no shadows dancing  
I look around as my heart is collapsing  
'Cause you're the only one I need  
So put a little love on me  
We wrote and we wrote  
'Til there were no more words  
We laughed and we cried  
Until we saw our worst  
Is it wrong that I still wonder where you are  
Is it wrong that I still don't know my heart  
Are you all dressed up but with nowhere to go  
Are your tears falling down when the lights are low  
Another Friday night tryna put on a show  
Do you hate the weekend 'cause nobody's calling  
I've still got so much love hidden beneath this skin  
With someone  
Put a little love on me put a little love on me  
When the lights come up and there's no shadows dancing  
I look around as my heart is collapsing  
'Cause you're the only one I need  
So put a little love on me  
Last night I lay awake  
Stuck on the things we say  
And when I close my eyes the first thing I hear you say is-  
Put a little love on me put a little love on me  
When the lights come up we're the only one dancing  
I look around and you're standing there asking  
You say you're the only one I need  
So put a little love on me  
You're the only one I need  
Put your love on me
