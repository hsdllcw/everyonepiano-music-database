### Money on My Mind歌词：

When I signed my deal  
I felt pressure  
Don't wanna see the numbers  
I wanna see heaven  
You say, could you write a song for me?  
I say, I'm sorry I won't do that happily

When I go home  
I tend to close the door  
I never wanted more  
So sing with me  
Can't you see

I don't have  
Money on my mind  
Money on my mind  
I do it for  
I do it for the love  
[x2]

I do it for the love  
I do it for the love

Please don't get me wrong  
I wanna keep it moving  
I know what that requires  
I'm not foolish  
Please, can you make this work for me?  
Cause I'm not a puppet, I will work against your strings

When I go home  
I tend to close the door  
I never wanted more  
So sing with me  
Can't you see

I don't have  
Money on my mind  
Money on my mind  
I do it for  
I do it for the love  
[x2]

I do it for the love  
I do it for the love

When the sun will set  
Don't you fret  
No I have no money on my mind  
No money on my mind  
No money on my mind  
No I have no money on my mind  
[x2]

Just love

Money on my mind  
Money on my mind  
I do it for  
I do it for the love

I don't have  
Money on my mind  
Money on my mind  
I do it for  
I do it for the love

I do it for the love  
I do it for the love
