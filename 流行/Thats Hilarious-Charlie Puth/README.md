### That's Hilarious歌词：

Look how all the tables  
Look how all the tables have turned  
Guess you're finally realizing how bad you messed it up  
Girl you're only makin'  
Girl you're only makin' it worse  
When you called like you always do when you want someone  
You took away a year of my f**kin' life  
And I can't get it back no more  
So when I see those tears  
Comin' out your eyes  
I hope it's me they're for  
You didn't love when you had me  
But now you need me so badly  
You can't be serious  
Ha-ha-ha  
That's hilarious  
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha  
Thinkin' I would still want you  
After the things you put me through  
Yeah you're delirious  
Ha-ha-ha  
That's hilarious  
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha  
Now you put the blame in  
Now you put the blame in reverse  
Tryna make me feel guilty for everything you've done  
You're another lesson  
You're another lesson  
You're just another lesson I learned  
Don't give your heart to a girl who's still got a broken one  
You took away a year of my f**kin' life  
And I can't get it back no more  
So when I see those tears  
When I see those tears  
Comin' out your eyes  
I hope it's me they're for  
You didn't love when you had me  
But now you need me so badly  
You can't be serious  
Ha-ha-ha  
That's hilarious  
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha  
Thinkin' I would still want you  
After the things you put me through  
Yeah you're delirious  
Ha-ha-ha  
That's hilarious  
That's hilarious  
You didn't love when you had me  
But now you need me so badly  
You can't be serious  
You can't be serious  
That's hilarious  
That's hilarious  
Thinkin' I would still want you  
After the things you put me through  
Yeah you're delirious  
You're delirious  
That's hilarious  
That's hilarious  
Ha-ha-ha  
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
