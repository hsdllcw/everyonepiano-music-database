### Good Thing歌词：

I book myself tables  
At all the best restaurants then eat alone  
I buy myself fast cars  
Just so I can drive them real f**kin' slow  
I like my own company  
Company I don't need it  
I'm not always cold  
I'm just good on my own so good on my own  
I've always been told one day I'll find  
Somebody who changes my mind  
If they come along I won't think twice  
'Cause I already got a good thing with me  
Yeah I already got everything I need  
The best things in life are already mine  
Don't tell me that you got a good thing for me  
'Cause I already got a good thing with me  
Yeah I already done everything I dream  
I'm good by myself don't need no one else  
Don't tell me that you got a good thing for me  
'Cause I already got a good thing  
I make myself up  
Just to dance in the mirror when I'm at home  
I pose and take pictures  
Then send them to people that I don't know  
I like getting compliments  
Compliments how I'm feeling oh  
I'm not always selfish  
Just bad at romance it's not in my bones  
I've always been told one day I'll find  
Somebody who changes my mind  
If they come along I won't think twice  
'Cause I already got a good thing with me  
Yeah I already got everything I need  
The best things in life are already mine  
Don't tell me that you got a good thing for me  
'Cause I already got a good thing with me  
Yeah I already done everything I dream  
I'm good by myself don't need no one else  
Don't tell me that you got a good thing for me  
'Cause I already got a good thing  
I've always been told one day I'll find  
Somebody who changes my mind  
If they come along I won't think twice  
'Cause I already got a good thing with me  
Yeah I already got everything I need  
The best things in life are already mine  
Don't tell me that you got a good thing for me  
No no  
'Cause I already got a good thing with me  
Yeah I already done everything I dream  
I'm good by myself don't need no one else  
Don't tell me that you got a good thing for me  
'Cause I already got a good thing
