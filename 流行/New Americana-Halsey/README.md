### New Americana歌词：

Cigarettes and tiny liquor bottles  
Just what you’d expect inside her new Balenciaga  
Viral mess, turned dreams into an empire  
Self-made success, now she rolls with Roc-A-Fellas

Survival of the richest, the city’s ours until the fall  
They're Monaco and Hamptons bound  
But we don’t feel like outsiders at all

We are the new Americana  
High on legal marijuana  
Raised on Biggie and Nirvana  
We are the new Americana

Young James Dean, some say he looks just like his father  
But he could never love somebody’s daughter  
Football team loved more than just the game  
So he vowed to be his husband at the altar

Survival of the richest, the city’s ours until the fall  
They're Monaco and Hamptons bound  
But we don’t feel like outsiders at all

We are the new Americana  
High on legal marijuana  
Raised on Biggie and Nirvana  
We are the new Americana

We know very well who we are  
So we hold it down when summer starts  
What kind of dough have you been spending?  
What kind of bubblegum have you been blowing lately?

We are the new Americana  
High on legal marijuana  
Raised on Biggie and Nirvana  
We are the new Americana

We are the new Americana (we know very well)  
High on legal marijuana (who we are)  
Raised on Biggie and Nirvana (so we hold it down)  
We are the new Americana
