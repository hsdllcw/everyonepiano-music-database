**SexyBack** 是Justin Timberlake曲风定义的一首标志性的歌曲。Justin
TImberlake作为一个美国歌手，艰辛是很大的，但就是因为这首sexy back
让所有艰辛变成了动力。在金牌制作人Timbaland的协助和众多人不看好的情况下，勇于为单飞后的性感转身做了个好头。推出后，马上引起巨大反响，被评为当年最性感男人。sexy
back 也是Jusin
Timberlake最喜欢的歌曲之一，因为成功，而且是自己的原意。几乎每场show或者演唱会都有唱。甚至在和日本smap的会见中也只简短唱了sexy
back和rock your body两首，可见对sexy back 的喜爱。

歌曲的MV大致讲的是JT与一个女特务之间的心理战。

_Sexy back_ 也是一种SM的暗号，意义为邀请xoxo，或者发出暗号。

另外，钟汉良2011年10月2日上海卢湾演唱会、香港歌手歌手林峯在2008年度香港小姐总决赛、杨宗纬Star!Start!星空传奇演唱会、亚洲时尚舞后ELVA萧亚轩在自己的WOW世界巡回演唱会中也翻唱过。

### SexyBack歌词：

I'm bringing sexy back  
Them other boys don't know how to act  
I think it's special  
what's behind your back  
So turn around and I'll pick up the slack  
Take'em to the bridge  
Dirty babe  
You see these shackles baby I'm your slave  
I'll let you whip me, if I misbehave  
It's just that no one makes me feel this way  
Take'em to the chorus  
Come here girl / go head be gone with it  
Come to the back / go head be gone with it  
VIP / go head be gone with it  
drinks on me /go head be gone with it  
Let me see what you're working with / go head be gone with it  
Look at those hips / go head be gone with it  
Make me smile / go head be gone with it  
Go ahead child / go head be gone with it  
and get your sexy on / go head be gone with it  
(repeat)  
I'm bringing sexy back  
Them other mother fuckers don't know how to act  
Girl let me make up for the things you lack  
Because you're burning up my body get it fast  
Take'em to the bridge  
Dirty babe  
You see these shackles baby I'm your slave  
I'll let you whip me, if I misbehave  
It's just that no one makes me feel this way  
Take'em to the chorus  
Come here girl / go head be gone with it  
Come to the back / go head be gone with it  
VIP / go head be gone with it  
drinks on me / go head be gone with it  
Let me see what you're working with / go head be gone with it  
Look at those hips / go head be gone with it  
Make me smile / go head be gone with it  
Go ahead child.. / go head be gone with it  
.and get your sexy on / go head be gone with it  
(repeat)  
Go, you ready (repeat) uh, yes.  
I'm bringing sexy back  
Them other mother fuckers wacth how I attack  
If that's your girl you better watch your back  
Because you'll burn it up for me and that's a fact  
Take'em to the chorus  
Come here girl / go head be gone with it  
Come to the back / go head be gone with it  
VIP / go head be gone with it

Let me see what you're working with / go head be gone with it  
Look at those hips / go head be gone with it  
Make me smile / go head be gone with it  
Go ahead child / go head be gone with it  
and get your sexy on / go head be gone with it  
(repeat)
