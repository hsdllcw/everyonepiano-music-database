### We Three Kings歌词：

We three kings of Orient are;  
Bearing gifts we traverse afar,  
Field and fountain, moor and mountain,  
Following yonder star.  
O star of wonder, star of night,  
Star with royal beauty bright,  
Westward leading, still proceeding,  
Guide us to thy perfect light.  
Born a King on Bethlehem's plain;  
Gold I bring to crown him again,  
King forever, ceasing never  
Over us all to reign.  
O star of wonder, star of night,  
Star with royal beauty bright,  
Westward leading, still proceeding,  
Guide us to thy perfect light.  
Frankincense to offer have I;  
Incense owns a Deity nigh;  
Prayer and praising all men raising,  
Worship him, God on high.  
O star of wonder, star of night,  
Star with royal beauty bright,  
Westward leading, still proceeding,  
Guide us to thy perfect light.  
Frankincense to offer have I;  
Incense owns a Deity nigh;  
Prayer and praising voices raising,  
Worshiping God on high.  
O star of wonder, star of night,  
Star with royal beauty bright,  
Westward leading, still proceeding,  
Guide us to thy perfect light.  
Myrrh is mine: its bitter perfume  
Breathes a life of gathering gloom:  
Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying,  
Sealed in the stone cold tomb.  
O star of wonder, star of night,  
Star with royal beauty bright,  
Westward leading, still proceeding,  
Guide us to thy perfect light.  
Glorious now behold him arise,  
King and God sacrifice;  
Alleluia, Alleluia!  
Sounds through the earth and skies.  
O star of wonder, star of night,  
Star with royal beauty bright,  
Westward leading, still proceeding,  
Guide us to thy perfect light.
