**Friend Of Mine双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Friend Of Mine_ 是由瑞典知名DJ Avicii制作，歌手Vargas & Lagola演唱。收录在Avicii的迷你专辑Avīci
(01)中。

Avicii总是乐于尝试运用新鲜刺激的方式推出自己音乐。他就像音乐界的“黑客”，做的电子乐风独树一格。无论是乡村还是爵士，无论是独立还摇滚，Avicii总是能通过“浩室”节拍和电音韵律的融合，让音乐在保持原味的基础上，焕发出另一种动感且层次分明的全新活力。其创作手法，类似于上海新天地的整合与改造。一样的石库门、一样的老弄堂，但却在设计师的精工妙笔之下，既维持了原貌又变得新颖时尚。

### Friend Of Mine歌词：

Hey  
Do you remember we said hello  
And you asked me about my Levi's T-shirt  
Said you are a friend of mine  
My oh my  
You must have saved me about a thousand times  
I wouldn't be the one I am today  
If you hadn't been a friend of mine  
I ain't misbehaving  
I'm just telling you the truth  
Take my love for granted  
Yeah I'll give it all to you  
Made me count for something  
Yeah I feel it in my heart  
God only knows what I've been  
If you've haven't been a friend of mine  
Hey  
Hey hey hey hey  
I haven't seen you around since high school  
High school  
How you doin' do you still remember me  
Are you still a friend of mine  
Guess you're still a friend of mine  
Guess you're still a friend of mine  
Now I see  
I see  
Why I get nervous when you look at me  
Oohhwoooh  
It's like your eye is trying to tell me something  
That you're more than just a friend of mine  
That you're more than just a friend of mine  
Oh my  
I ain't misbehaving  
I'm just telling you the truth  
Take my love for granted  
Yeah I'll give it all to you  
Made me count for something  
Yeah I feel it in my heart  
God only knows what I'd've been  
If you hadn't been a friend of mine
