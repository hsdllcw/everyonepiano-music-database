### Nevada歌词：

I've been painting every fence I know  
Every color bleeds into the same  
'Cause before you go and walk away  
Yeah you better know where you're going  
Hey ya hey ya  
You're a wanderer just like me  
Hey ya hey ya  
Yeah you better know where you're going  
Yeah you better know where you're going  
I've been painting every fence I know  
Every color bleeds into the same  
'Cause before you go and walk away  
Yeah you better know where you're going  
Hey ya hey ya  
You're a wanderer just like me  
Hey ya hey ya  
Yeah you better know where you're going  
You're a wanderer just like me  
Yeah you better know where you're going  
Yeah you better know where you're going  
Yeah you better know where you're going  
You're a wanderer just like me  
Yeah you better know where you're going  
You're a wanderer just like me
