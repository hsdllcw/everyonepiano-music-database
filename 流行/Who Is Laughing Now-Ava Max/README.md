### Who's Laughing Now歌词：

Never knew the sting of a stranger  
Never felt the words like a razor  
But I won't give a d**n 'bout it later  
All the little digs doesn't matter  
Writin' down a brand new chapter  
Where there's only love never anger  
So lonely in your bed  
Does breakin' me make you feel good  
Guess you don't understand  
What goes around comes around  
Don't ya know that I'm stronger  
Don't ya see me in all black  
Don't ya cry like a baby  
Ha-ha-ha-ha ha-ha-ha  
Who's laughing now  
Know that it's over  
Don't ya know I won't call back  
Don't ya cry like a baby  
Ha-ha-ha-ha ha-ha-ha  
Who's laughing now  
You'll never see me blue never bleedin'  
Hope you understand how I'm feelin'  
I'm turnin' off my phone like I'm leaving  
Bye  
Pushed me to the edge now it's over  
Shuttin' off the hate gettin' closure  
This will be the dust when I'm older uh  
So lonely in your bed  
Does breakin' me make you feel good  
Guess you don't understand  
What goes around comes around  
Don't ya know that I'm stronger  
Don't ya see me in all black  
Don't ya cry like a baby  
Ha-ha-ha-ha ha-ha-ha  
Who's laughing now  
Know that it's over  
Don't ya know I won't call back  
Don't ya cry like a baby  
Ha-ha-ha-ha ha-ha-ha  
Who's laughing now  
Ha-ha-ha-ha ha-ha-ha  
Ha-ha-ha-ha ha-ha-ha  
Who's laughing now  
It's comical hysterical  
So ridiculous think you messed me up  
Don't ya know that I'm stronger  
Don't ya see me in all black  
Don't ya cry like a baby  
Oh  
Ha-ha-ha-ha ha-ha-ha  
Who's laughing now  
Know that it's over  
Don't ya know I won't call back  
Call back  
Don't ya cry like a baby  
Ha-ha-ha-ha ha-ha-ha  
Who's laughing now
