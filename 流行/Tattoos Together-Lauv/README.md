**Tattoos Together** 是由美国唱作男歌手Lauv录唱的一首歌曲，被收录在Lauv的首张录音室专辑《~How I’m
Feeling~》，为其所属专辑中的第16首歌曲。

相信大家跟自己的男女朋友都会用一些小小的东西或事情做为自己的定情之物或是回忆！而 Lauv
在这首歌中则是唱到了和一个暧昧的女孩一起去刺青，纯情的他却以为这就是最美好的爱了，没有确认的关系，靠着太阳月亮的符号相爱，却是两个极端，最终希望只是希望，还是发现了她居然和大提琴手在一起，默默地落下眼泪。

音乐方面，Lauv没有拿出他的招牌电音音效及律动感，而是以一个比较快乐轻松小品的风格呈现给大家，整体上还是非常的具有律动感，会让人越听心情越好。

### Tattoos Together歌词：

Said I'd never fall I'd never fall  
I'd never fall but then I fell for you mm  
Back against the wall against the wall  
Against the wall that'show it felt with you mm mm  
One weekend in Portland  
You weren't even my girlfriend  
We were walkin and talkin'  
And somebody said Let's get  
Tattoos together something to remember  
If it's way too soon f**k it whatever  
Give me shapes and letters  
If it's not forever then at least we'll have tattoos together  
Mhm 'cause I love you  
Mhm 'cause I love you  
Mhm 'cause I love you  
Mhm  
Knew it from the moment from the moment  
From the moment that I saw you naked mm yeah  
I could never love nobody else nobody else  
Nobody else the way I loved you baby mm mm  
One weekend no sleepin'  
You weren't even my girlfriend  
We were kissing like real kissing  
And somebody said Let's get  
Tattoos together something to remember  
If it's way too soon f**k it whatever  
Give me shapes and letters  
If it's not forever then at least we'll have tattoos together  
Mhm 'cause I love you  
Mhm 'cause I love you  
Mhm 'cause I love you  
Mhm tattoos together  
Yeah your cherry earrings are my favorite  
Favorite  
It looks so good I'd rather save it  
Save it  
I've been hopin' prayin' we last forever  
'Cause there's nothing better than you and I  
Tattoos together something to remember  
If it's way too soon f**k it whatever  
Give me shapes and letters  
If it's not forever then at least we'll have tattoos together  
Mhm 'cause I love you  
Mhm 'cause I love you  
Mhm 'cause I love you  
Mhm oh
