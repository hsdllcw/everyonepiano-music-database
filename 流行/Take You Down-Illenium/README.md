**Take You Down** 是一首由ILLENIUM演唱的英文歌曲，该歌曲收录在其第三张录音室专辑《Ascend》中。

“生活有时像一片深不见底的汪洋”,《 _Take You Down_
》就像一头饱经沧桑的蓝鲸，游于无边汪洋。在嘈杂的开始中Bass如捏住了生活的低沉，沧桑地孤鸣着，塑造蓝鲸灵魂深处的失落与绝望。Dry
vocal里似住着嘶哑着的孤独枭雄，随歌起伏沉落。似被压制的鼓点也只有随着Build-
up加速才真正显现出来，到达drop这最燃之时，ILLENIUM所经受的挣扎却在此时似阳光下的锐刺，泛出的寒光再亮不过，满溢悲凉，与vocal合为一体，这是蓝鲸历经深海低沉后从海面腾跃而起的震撼。最后，歌曲在Bass的低沉中倏然结束。这就是ILLENIUM自己的故事，时有起伏却终属低沉，像一头蓝鲸的故事，悲凉不已。

### Take You Down歌词：

I didn't mean to hurt you when I hurt myself  
It's just an empty voice screaming out for help  
No I didn't mean to scare you  
But I couldn't see  
That when I went to hell I was taking you with me  
When I close my eyes  
I'm climbing in the dark  
Trying not to fall apart  
Sometimes I get so high  
Falling is the only out I see  
And I don't wanna take you down with me  
Yeah I'm loving my out  
And you're loving my out  
Take you down  
Take you down with me  
Don't wanna take you down  
Take you down  
Take you down with me  
Down with me  
You're only love in my heart  
Only love in my heart take you down  
This life is like a razor  
When it cuts I bleed  
But it's in my hand  
And I'm doing it to me  
Sometimes it's like an ocean  
And it gets too deep  
And there's no way that now you could rescue me  
When I close my eyes  
I'm fighting in the dark  
Trying not to break your heart  
Sometimes I get so high  
Falling is the only out I see  
And I don't wanna take you down with me  
You need to let it go now  
Before you drown  
I know that you won't understand  
But you need to let go of these hands  
'Cause I'm going down  
And I don't wanna take you down with me  
And I don't wanna take you down with me  
Take you down down with me
