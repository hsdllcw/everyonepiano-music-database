**Man on a Wire** 是英国流行摇滚乐队The Script所演唱的一首歌曲。The Script是一支三人摇滚乐队，成员包括主唱Danny
O'Donoghue(生于1980.10.3)、光头吉他手Mark Sheehan、鼓手Glen Power。但颇令人迷惑的是，单从曲风上来说，The
Script的音乐听起来不太像爱尔兰摇滚，反而美国的味道更浓一些。原来The
Script三位成员的其中两位，Mark与Danny在青少年时期就在都柏林的詹姆士街区相识，两人均对美国黑人音乐情有独钟。而且Danny
O'Donoghue和Mark
Sheehan在乐队还未成立之前，就由于他们在录音室出众的制作才能而被邀请到美国LA去和R%26amp;B的巨头如Rodney Jerkins、Dallas
Austin等著名音乐人一起工作。另外， _Man on a Wire_ 此曲收录在其专辑No Sound Without Silence中。

### Man on a Wire歌词：

Who'd have thought that I'd be here by myself?  
Who'd have thought that you'd be bad for my health?  
Now I know, now I know I'm just a man on a wire  
Who'd have thought about the cause and effect?  
Yesterday's love is not tomorrow's regret  
Now I know, now I know I'm just a man on a wire

No, I can't look down  
I'm trying to fight the feeling  
I will fall to the ground  
If I ever see you  
'Cause I feel like I'm walkin' on a tightrope

My heart is in my throat  
I'm counting on high hopes to get me over you  
And I've got my eyes closed  
As long as the wind blows  
I'm counting on high hopes to get me over you, you

'Cause I'm a man on a wire, on a wire  
I'm a man on a wire, on a wire

Who'd have thought I'd see you with someone else?  
Who'd have thought that I'd be in such a mess?  
Now you know, now you know I'm just a man on a wire

But I walk that line  
I try to keep my senses  
Make it to the other side  
I know the consequences  
and I feel like I'm walkin' on a tightrope

My heart is in my throat  
I'm counting on high hopes to get me over you  
And I've got my eyes closed  
As long as the wind blows  
I'm counting on high hopes to get me over you, you

'Cause I'm a man on a wire, on a wire  
I'm a man on a wire, on a wire  
'Cause I'm a man on a wire, on a wire  
'Cause I'm a man on a wire, on a wire

The higher I get  
The more I miss the ground  
No safety nets  
Now you're not around  
I have to keep walking  
To keep me from falling down  
Feels like I'm walkin' on a tightrope

My heart is in my throat  
I'm counting on high hopes to get me over you  
And I've got my eyes closed  
As long as the wind blows  
I'm counting on high hopes to get me over you, you

'Cause I'm a man on a wire, on a wire  
I'm a man on a wire, on a wire  
'Cause I'm a man on a wire, on a wire  
'Cause I'm a man on a wire, on a wire
