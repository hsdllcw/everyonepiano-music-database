Avril Lavigne所演唱的单曲《 **Wish You Were Here** 》由Avril与Max
Martin、Shellback共同撰写，收录在Avril Lavigne第四张主流厂牌专辑《Goodbye
Lullaby》中。它在2011年9月9日作为专辑的第三支单曲发行。

Avril接受Billboard杂志采访时表示道：“《 _Wish You Were Here_
》这首单曲写的是思念曾经的爱人走不出阴影，而不断回忆起过往一起的光阴和美好的时刻。这支MV让我身处其境，想起了自己曾经的经历，所以我忍不住真情流露在拍摄的时候大哭一场。尽管我知道这都是在工作，但是我知道有些东西让我很有感触，因此我这样做了。”

歌词的下方还提供了 _Wish You Were Here钢琴谱_ ，欢迎感兴趣的朋友下载使用。
