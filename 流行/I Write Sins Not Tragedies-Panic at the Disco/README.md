### I Write Sins Not Tragedies歌词：

Oh, well imagine; as I'm pacing the pews in a church corridor,  
and I can't help but to hear,  
no I can't help but to hear an exchanging of words:  
"What a beautiful wedding, what a beautiful wedding!"  
says the bridesmaid to the waiter.  
"Yes, but what a shame, what a shame,  
the poor groom's bride is a whore."

closing the goddamn door?!"  
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things  
with a sense of voice and rationality.  
I'd chime in "Haven't you people ever heard  
of closing the goddamn door?!"  
No, it's much better to face  
these kinds of things with a sense of...  
I'd chime in with a "Haven't you people ever heard of  
closing the goddamn door?!"  
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things  
with a sense of voice and rationality.  
I'd chime in "Haven't you people ever heard  
of closing the goddamn door?!"  
No, it's much better to face  
these kinds of things with a sense of...
