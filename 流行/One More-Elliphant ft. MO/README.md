### One More歌词：

[Verse 1: Elliphant]  
Come on na sugar, come  
I really don't wanna go home  
Stay with me, be a friend  
These streets so cold and my money full of ghost  
Come up na we take your car  
I own sleazy bar  
Now far downtown you can tackle slow free  
And it's open all night, come on hang with me  
I got money (x4)  
(I play for you, I play for you)  
(I play for you, you play for me)

[Chorus: Elliphant & MØ]  
Stay with me tonight  
We can count the street lights  
Stay with me alright  
Let's bring it all back to life  
Don't fade away  
Stay

[Verse 2: Elliphant & MØ]  
I like it here, f**k work  
Plus you said your boss is a jerk  
I need you tight, don't bang on me  
Imma break your s**t, let's do what we  
Always used to do  
Stupid around like two fools  
Nights alone, I'm feel alone  
You look after me, it hurts  
I got money (x4)  
(I play for you, I play for you)  
(I play for you, you play for me)  
(Won't you play for me, oh)

[Chorus: Elliphant & MØ]

[Bridge: Elliphant & MØ]  
One more  
Come on  
It's not a big deal  
One more (one more, girl)  
On me (come on)  
Let we go on  
It's not a big deal (it's not a big deal)  
One more (one more)  
On me (come on)  
It's not a big deal (it's not a big deal)  
One more (one more)  
On me (on me)  
Let we go on (et we go on)  
It's not a big deal (it's not a big deal)

[Chorus: Elliphant & MØ]  
Stay with me tonight  
We can count the street lights  
Don't fade away  
Stay with me alright  
Let's bring it all back to life  
Don't fade away  
Stay
