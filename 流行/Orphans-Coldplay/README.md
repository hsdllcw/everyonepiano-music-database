### Orphans歌词：

I want to know  
When I can go  
Back and get drunk with my friends  
Rosaleem of the damascene  
Yes she had eyes like the moon  
Would have been on the silver screen  
But for the missile monsoon  
She went  
Woo woo  
Woo woo oo oo oo  
Indigo up in heaven today  
Woo woo  
Woo woo oo oo oo  
With bombs going  
Boom baboomboom  
She say  
I want to know  
When I can go  
Back and get drunk with my friends  
I want to know when I can go  
Back and be young again  
Baba would go where the flowers grow  
Almond and peach trees in bloom  
And he would know  
Just when and what to sow  
So golden and opportune  
He went  
Woo woo  
Woo woo oo oo oo  
Tulips the color of honey today  
It's true true  
Woo woo  
Woo woo oo oo oo  
With bombs going  
Boom baboomboom  
He say  
Oh I want to know  
When I can go  
Back and get drunk with my friends  
I want to know  
When I can go  
Back and be young again  
Woo woo  
Woo woo oo oo oo  
Woo woo  
Woo woo oo oo oo  
Cherubim seraphim soon  
Come sailing us home by the light of the moon  
Oh I want to know  
When I can go  
Back and get drunk with my friends  
Oh I want to know  
When can I go  
Back and feel home again  
Woo woo  
Woo woo oo oo oo oo  
I guess we'll be raised on our own then  
Woo woo  
Woo woo oo oo oo oo  
I want to be with you 'til the world ends  
I want to be with you 'til the whole world ends
