### Torn歌词：

i thought i saw a man brought to life.我以为找到了生命中的男人.  
he was warm.他是如此的温煦  
he came around like he was dignified.他在我身边时是如此有品位.  
he showed me what it was to cry.他使我了解到什么是哭泣.  
well u couldn't b that man i adored.于是你就不配当我仰慕的对象.  
you don't seem to know.你不明白  
seem to care what ur heart is for.也不在乎,你的心到底在想什么.  
but i don't know him anymore.可我不再了解他.  
there's nothing where he used to lie.他连谎言都没机会说.  
my inspiration has run dry.我已不再感兴趣.  
that's what's going on.这就是现在的情况.  
nothing's fine,i'm torn.没有好心情,我的心被伤透了.  
i'm all out of faith,this is how i feel.我感到信心全无.  
i'm cold i'm shamed.我又冷又被愚弄.  
lying naked on the floor.屈辱的躺在冰冷的地板上.  
illusion never changed into something real.梦想并没有变成现实.  
i'm wide awake i can see the perfect sky is torn.清晨迷茫的醒来,只看到明亮天空被撕碎.  
you're a little late,i'm already torn.你来迟了一点,我已伤透了心.  
so i guess the fortune teller's right.所以我想先知是对的.  
should have seen just.现在的情况就是这样.  
what was there not some holy light.没有几个好夜晚.  
to crawl beneath my veins now.我心里只有你,但现在.  
i don't care,i have no luck.我不在乎,算我倒霉.  
i don't miss it all that much.不再想那么多.  
there's just so many things.有太多事情.  
that i can't touch,i'm torn.我无能为力,我伤透了心.
