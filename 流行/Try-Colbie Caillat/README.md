### Try歌词：

Put your make up on  
Get your nails done  
Curl your hair  
Run the extra mile  
Keep it slim  
So they like you, do they like you?

Get your sexy on  
Don't be shy, girl  
Take it off  
This is what you want, to belong  
So they like you, do you like you?

You don't have to try so hard  
You don't have to give it all away  
You just have to get up, get up, get up, get up  
You don't have to change a single thing

You don't have to try, try, try, try  
You don't have to try, try, try, try  
You don't have to try, try, try, try  
You don't have to try  
Yooou don't have to try

Ohh

Get your shopping on, at the mall, max your credit cards  
You don't have to choose, buy it all  
Do they like you? Do they like you?

Wait a second,  
Why should you care, what they think of you  
When you're all alone, by yourself  
Do you like you? Do you like you?

You don't have to try so hard  
You don't have to give it all away  
You just have to get up, get up, get up, get up  
You don't have to change a single thing

You don't have to try so hard  
You don't have to bend until you break  
You just have to get up, get up, get up, get up  
You don't have to change a single thing

You don't have to try, try, try, try  
You don't have to try, try, try, try  
You don't have to try, try, try, try  
You don't have to try

You don't have to try, try, try, try  
You don't have to try, try, try, try  
You don't have to try, try, try, try  
You don't have to try  
Yooou don't have to try

Noooo  
Oooh

You don't have to try so hard  
You don't have to give it all away  
You just have to get up, get up, get up, get up  
You don't have to change a single thing

You don't have to try, try, try, try  
You don't have to try, try, try, try  
You don't have to try  
You don't have to try

Take your make up off  
Let your hair down  
Take a breath  
Look into the mirror, at yourself  
Don't you like you?  
Cause I like you
