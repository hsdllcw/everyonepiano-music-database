**Fernando**
是瑞典的流行组合ABBA的单曲。ABBA，成立于1972年。乐队名称来自于四名成员的姓名前字母的缩写的组合，这两男两女在事业走上坡路时曾是两对夫妻，在事业开始下坡时又分别劳燕分飞，是流行音乐史上著名的夫妻组合也是著名的离婚组合。ABBA于1982年解散。

  
他们的事业在1975年开始起飞，他们的每首单曲都十分动听，并且一次次的赢得音乐榜冠军，这其中包括著名的歌曲《Mamma
Mia》。乐队甚至得到了令人骄傲的头衔——Greatest
Hits（最伟大的音乐榜冠军）紧接着，他们的音乐巅峰时代随着唱片《1976》的发行而到来。这张唱片比其他的任何唱片都要完美，在音乐创作和录音方面，这张唱片都达到音乐创作的新高度。唱片中的许多音乐打榜成功，这包括《Knowing
Me，Knowing You》、《 _Fernando_ 》以及使ABBA功成名就的打榜歌曲《Dancing
Queen》。一系列的成功使乐队财源广进。这时的ABBA在英国和澳洲极受欢迎，但在美国市场仍旧反应平平。《Dancing
Queen》是ABBA乐队在美国唯一的一支冠军歌曲。

### Fernando歌词：

Can you hear the drums Fernando?  
I remember long ago another starry night like this  
In the firelight Fernando  
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar  
I could hear the distant drums  
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando  
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally  
I was so afraid Fernando  
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die  
And I'm not ashamed to say  
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night  
The stars were bright, Fernando  
They were shining there for you and me  
For liberty, Fernando  
Though we never thought that we could lose  
There's no regret  
If I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando  
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand  
Can you hear the drums Fernando?  
Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande?  
I can see it in your eyes  
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night  
The stars were bright, Fernando  
They were shining there for you and me  
For liberty, Fernando  
Though we never thought that we could lose  
There's no regret  
If I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando

There was something in the air that night  
The stars were bright, Fernando  
They were shining there for you and me  
For liberty, Fernando  
Though we never thought that we could lose  
There's no regret  
If I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando  
Yes, if I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando...
