《 **Golden Hour** 》是音乐人JVKE演唱的歌曲。JVKE，因在网络对部分热门流行歌曲进行混搭，而被大众熟知。

这首歌富有画面感和层次感，副歌部分像是主人公穿过重重记忆碎片，终于找寻到了自己的Golden
Hour，不舍、怀念与渴望相继爆发，层层叠加。1:00左右开始的急促的小提琴给人一种满怀希望急急穿行的感觉，却在持续了短短十几秒之后戛然而止，然而Golden
Hour对主人公至关重要、刻骨铭心，随之迸发的对Golden
Hour的追寻也更加猛烈深刻。结尾部分孩童的笑声与开头相照应，最后的钢琴独奏，表现出主人公终于从回忆中走出，在找寻到Golden
Hour之后的心安和释然，使他能够直面未来。之所以会是一段Golden Hour，是因为那时有挚爱存在。

### Golden Hour歌词：

It was just two lovers  
Sittin' in the car listening to Blonde fallin' for each other  
Pink and orange skies feelin' super childish no Donald Glover  
Missed call from my mother  
Like "Where you at tonight"  
Got no alibi I was all alone  
With the love of my life  
She's got glitter for skin  
My radiant beam in the night  
I don't need no light to see you  
Shine  
It's your golden hour  
You slow down time  
In your golden hour  
We were just two lovers  
Feet up on the dash drivin' nowhere fast burnin' through the summer  
Radio on blast make the moment last she got solar power  
Minutes feel like hours  
She knew she was the baddest  
Can you even imagine fallin' like I did  
For the love of my life  
She's got glow on her face  
A glorious look in her eyes  
My angel of light  
I was all alone with the love of my life  
She's got glitter for skin  
My radiant beam in the night  
I don't need no light to see you  
Shine  
It's your golden hour  
You slow down time  
In your golden hour
