### Wiggle歌词：

Hey, yo, Jason  
Say somethin' to her  
Holla at her  
[Laughs]  
I got one question  
How do you fit all that in them jeans?  
[Laughs]

You know what to do with that big fat butt

Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle  
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle  
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle  
Just a little bit of... swing

Patty cake, Patty cake  
With no hands  
Got me in this club making wedding plans  
If I take pictures while you do your dance  
I can make you famous on Instagram

Hot damn it  
Your booty like two planets  
Go head, and go ham sandwich  
Whoa, I can't stand it

'Cause you know what to do with that big fat butt

Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle  
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle  
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle  
Just a little bit of... swing

Cadillac, Cadillac, pop that trunk  
Let's take a shot  
Alley oop that dunk  
Tired of working that 9 to 5  
Oh baby let me come and change your life

Hot damn it  
Your booty like two planets  
Go head, and go ham sandwich  
Whoa, I can't stand it

'Cause you know what to do with that big fat butt

Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle  
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle  
(Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle)  
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle  
(Shake it, shake it girl)  
Just a little bit of  
(Little bit of, little bit of, little bit of swing!)

[Snoop Dogg:]  
Shake what your mama gave you  
Misbehave you  
I just wanna strip you, dip you, flip you, bubble bathe you  
What they do  
Taste my rain drops, K boo  
Now what you will and what you want and what you may do  
Completely separated,  
Till I deeply penetrate it  
Then I take it out and wipe it off  
Eat it, ate it, love it, hate it  
Overstated, underrated, everywhere I've been  
Can you wiggle, wiggle for the D, O, double G, again?

Come on baby  
Turn around (turn around, turn around, turn around)  
You're a star girl  
Take a bow (take a bow, take a bow, take a bow)  
It's just one thing that's killing me  
How'd you get that in them jeans?

You know what to do with that big fat butt

Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle  
(Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle)  
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle  
(Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle)  
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle  
(Shake it, shake it girl)  
Just a little bit of  
(Little bit of, wiggle wiggle)  
Wiggle, wiggle

Now make it clap  
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle  
Now make it clap  
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle  
Make it clap  
(Baby when you do it like that)  
Just a little bit of  
Now make it clap  
No hands baby, make it clap, clap, clap  
(Like swing)  
Damn baby you got a bright future behind you
