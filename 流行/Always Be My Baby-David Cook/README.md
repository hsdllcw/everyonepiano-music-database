**Always Be My Baby** 是美国歌手David
Cook的一首抒情摇滚歌曲。该曲成为iTunes最热门的歌曲，在单日(4月16日)下载量以大比数抛远对手。

  
David Cook的美偶之路是从奥马哈市(Omaha)的海选开始的，开赛之初他还是一名酒保，好莱坞周之时，评委西蒙(Simon)还曾因为David
Cook的吉他质疑了他单独演唱的能力，事实却证明铁面判官西蒙也有犯错之时，越来越激烈的竞争之下，David
Cook显示出了他顽强的摇滚精神与独特的原创能力。他演唱的《Billie
Jean》虽然不是原创编排，但却登上了当周iTunes下载量榜首，之后便一发不可收拾。

### Always Be My Baby歌词：

we were as one babe  
for a moment in time  
and it seemed everlasting  
that you would always be mine  
now you want to be free  
so I'm letting you fly  
cause i know in my heart babe  
our love will never die,no!

you'll always be a part of me

i'm a part of you indefinitely

Girl don't you know you can't escape me

ooh darling cause you'll always be my baby

and we'll linger on

time can't erase a feeling this strong

no way you're never gonna shake me

ooh darling cause you'll always be my baby

i ain't gonna cry no  
and i won't beg you to stay  
if you're determined to leave girl  
i will not stand in your way  
but inevitably you'll be back again  
cause ya know in your heart babe  
our love will never end no  
i know that you'll be back girl  
when your days and your nights  
get a little bit colder ooohhh  
i know that,you'll be right back, baby  
oh, baby believe me it's only a matter of time  
always be my baby
