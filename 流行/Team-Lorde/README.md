### Team歌词：

Wait 'til you’re announced  
We’ve not yet lost all our graces  
The hounds will stay in chains  
Look upon your greatness  
That you’ll send  
The call I'll send  
The call I'll send  
The call I'll send  
The call I'll send  
The call I'll send  
The call I'll send  
The call I'll send  
The call I'll send  
The call I'll send  
The call I'll send  
The call I'll send  
The call I'll send  
The call I'll send  
The call I'll send  
Call all the ladies out  
They’re in there finally  
A hundreds jewels on throats  
A hundred jewels between teeth  
Now bring my boys in  
Their skin in craters like the moon  
The moon we love like a brother,  
while he glows through the room  
Dancin' around the lies we told  
Dancin' around big eyes as well  
Even the comatose they don’t dance and tell  
We live in cities you'll never see on screen  
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run free  
Living in ruins of the palace within my dreams  
And you know, we're on each other's team  
I'm kind of over being told to throw my hands up in the air,  
so there  
So all the cups got broke shards beneath our feet  
but it wasn’t my fault  
And everyone’s competing for a love they won't recieve  
Cause what this palace wants is release  
We live in cities you'll never see on screen  
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run free  
Living in ruins of the palace within my dreams  
And you know, we're on each other's team  
I’m kind of over getting told to throw my hands up in the air  
So there  
I’m kinda older than I was when rebelled without a care  
So there  
We live in cities you'll never see on screen  
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run free  
Living in ruins of the palace within my dreams  
And you know, we're on each other's team  
We're on each other's team  
And you know, we're on each other's team  
We're on each other's team  
And you know, and you know, and you know
