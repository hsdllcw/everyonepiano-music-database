### Mother's Daughter歌词：

Hallelujah I'm a freak I'm a freak hallelujah  
Every day of the week I'ma do ya like I want to  
I'm a Nile crocodile a piranha  
Oh my God she got the power  
Oh look at her she got the power  
So so so  
Don't f**k with my freedom  
I came back to get me some  
I'm nasty I'm evil  
Must be something in the water or that I'm my mother's daughter  
Don't f**k with my freedom  
I came back to get me some  
I'm nasty I'm evil  
Must be something in the water or that I'm my mother's daughter  
So back up back up back up back up boy ooh  
Back up back up back up back up boy ooh  
Hallelujah I'm a witch I'm a witch hallelujah  
Swish swish I'm a three-point shooter I blow through ya  
Like a hot wind out in the bayou ya  
Oh my God she got the power  
Well look at her she got the power  
Don't f**k with my freedom  
I came back to get me some  
I'm nasty I'm evil  
Must be something in the water or that I'm my mother's daughter  
Don't f**k with my freedom  
I came back to get me some  
I'm nasty I'm evil  
Must be something in the water or that I'm my mother's daughter  
So back up back up back up back up boy ooh

So I did it yeah I did it  
My mama always told me that I'd make it  
That I'd make it so I made it  
I put my back into and my heart in it  
So I did it yeah I did it  
Don't f**k with my freedom  
I came back to get me some  
I'm nasty I'm evil  
Must be something in the water or that I'm my mother's daughter  
Don't f**k with my freedom  
Oh my God oh my God
