### Bills, Bills, Bills歌词：

At first, we started out real cool  
Takin' me places I ain't never been  
But now, you're getting comfortable  
Ain't doin' those things you did no more  
You're slowly makin' me pay for things  
Your money should be handling  
And now you ask to use my car (Car)  
Drive it all day and don't fill up the tank  
And you have the audacity  
To even come and step to me and  
Ask to hold some money from me  
Until you get yo' check next week  
You triflin', good-for-nothing type of brother  
Silly me, why haven't I found another?  
A baller, when times get hard  
I need someone to help me out  
Instead of a scrub like you  
Who don't know what a man's about  
Can you pay my bills?  
Can you pay my telephone bills?  
Do you pay my automo' bills?  
If you did, then maybe we could chill  
I don't think you do  
So, you and me are through  
Can you pay my bills?  
Can you pay my telephone bills?  
Do you pay my automo' bills?  
If you did, then maybe we could chill  
I don't think you do  
So, you and me are through  
Now you've been maxing out my card (Card)  
Gave me bad credit, buyin' me gifts with my own ends  
Haven't paid the first bill  
But you're steady headin' to the mall  
Goin' on shopping sprees, perpetratin'  
To your friends like you be ballin'  
And then you use my cellphone (Phone)  
Callin' whoever that you think's at home  
And then, when the bill comes  
All of a sudden, you be actin' dumb  
Don't know where none of these calls come from  
When your momma's number's here more than once  
You triflin', good-for-nothing type of brother  
Silly me, why haven't I found another?  
A baller, when times get hard  
I need someone to help me out  
Instead of a scrub like you  
Who don't know what a man's about  
Can you pay my bills?  
Can you pay my telephone bills?  
Do you pay my automo' bills? (Pay my bill)  
If you did, then maybe we could chill  
I don't think you do  
So, you and me are through  
Can you pay my bills?  
Can you pay my telephone bills?  
Do you pay my automo' bills?  
If you did, then maybe we could chill  
I don't think you do (Oh, no no, no no)  
So, you and me are through  
You triflin', good-for-nothing type of brother (Good for nothing)  
Oh silly me, why haven't I found another? (Found another)  
You triflin', good-for-nothing type of brother (Hey)  
Oh silly me, why haven't I found another? (Oh-ooh-whoa)  
You triflin', good-for-nothing type of brother (Oh-ooh no, no)  
Oh silly me, why haven't I found another? (No no, no no, no no, no no)  
You triflin', good-for-nothing type of brother (Good for nada, hey)  
Oh silly me, why haven't I found another?  
Can you pay my bills?  
Can you pay my telephone bills?  
Do you pay my automo' bills?  
If you did, then maybe we could chill  
I don't think you do  
So, you and me are through  
Can you pay my bills?  
Can you pay my telephone bills?  
Do you pay my automo' bills? (Telephone)  
If you did, then maybe we could chill (Please pay the bills)  
I don't think you do (I don't think you do)  
So, you and me are through  
Can you pay my bills?  
Can you pay my telephone bills?  
Do you pay my automo' bills?  
If you did, then maybe we could chill  
I don't think you do  
So, you and me are through  
Can you pay my bills?  
Can you pay my telephone bills?  
Do you pay my automo' bills?  
If you did, then maybe we could chill  
I don't think you do  
So, you and me are through  
Thou shalt confess
