**Natural双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Natural_ 是美国乐队组合Imagine Dragons演唱的一首歌曲，收录于Imagine Dragons
2018年7月17日发行的专辑《Natural》中。Imagine
Dragons音乐中最迷人的特质就是融合了电子乐和摇滚乐的时尚曲风，主唱丹•雷诺斯来去自如的真假音穿梭，让人时而坠入云端、时而潜入深海的如冒险般体验的旋律。也因为乐队歌曲中的大片即视感，让其接连成为好莱坞电影的插曲、主题曲坐镇者。

### Natural歌词：

Well you hold the line  
When every one of them is giving up or giving in tell me  
In this house of mine  
Nothing ever comes without a consequence or cost tell me  
Will the stars align  
Will heaven step in  
Will it save us from our sin  
Will it  
'Cause this house of mine stands strong  
That's the price you pay  
Leave behind your heartache cast away  
Just another product of today  
Rather be the hunter than the prey  
And you're standing on the edge face up  
'Cause you're a natural  
A beating heart of stone  
You gotta be so cold  
To make it in this world  
Yeah you're a natural  
Living your life cutthroat  
You gotta be so cold  
Yeah you're a natural  
Will somebody  
Let me see the light within the dark trees' shadows and  
What's happenin'  
Lookin' through the glass find the wrong within the past knowin'  
Oh we are the youth  
Call out to the beast not a word without the peace facing  
A bit of the truth the truth  
That's the price you pay  
Leave behind your heartache cast away  
Just another product of today  
Rather be the hunter than the prey  
And you're standing on the edge face up  
'Cause you're a natural  
A beating heart of stone  
You gotta be so cold  
To make it in this world  
Yeah you're a natural  
Living your life cutthroat  
You gotta be so cold  
Yeah you're a natural  
Deep inside me I'm fading to black I'm fading  
Took an oath by the blood of my hand won't break it  
I can taste it the end is upon us I swear  
Gonna make it  
I'm gonna make it  
Natural  
A beating heart of stone  
You gotta be so cold  
To make it in this world  
Yeah you're a natural  
Living your life cutthroat  
You gotta be so cold  
Yeah you're a natural  
Natural  
Yeah you're a natural
