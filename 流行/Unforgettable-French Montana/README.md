### Unforgettable歌词：

It's not good enough for me since I been with you  
It's not gonna work for you nobody can equal me  
I'm gonna sip on this drink when I'm f**ked up  
I should know how to pick up  
I'm gonna catch the rhythm while she push up against me  
Oh was she tipsy  
I had enough convo for 24  
I peep'd you from across the room  
Pretty little body dancing like GoGo aye  
And you are unforgettable  
I need to get you alone  
Why not  
A f**king good time never hurt nobody  
I got a little drink but it's not Bacardi  
If you loved your girl then I'm so so sorry  
I got to give it to her like we in a marriage  
Oh like we in a hurry  
No no I won't tell nobody  
You're on your level too  
Tryna do what lovers do  
Feelin' like I'm fresh out Boosie  
If they want the drama got the Uzi  
Ship the whole crew to the cruise ship  
Doin' shit you don't even see in movies  
Ride with me  
Ride with me boss  
I got a hard head but her ass soft  
She want the last name with the ring on it  
'Cause I pulled out a million cash told her plank on it  
You are unforgettable  
I need to get you alone  
Now you wanna chose  
Just pop the bubbly in the 'cuzi  
It's not good enough for me since I been with you  
I'm gonna sip on this drink when I'm f**ked up  
I should know how to pick up  
I'm gonna catch the rhythm while she push up against me  
Oh was she tipsy  
I had enough convo for 24  
I peep'd you from across the room  
Pretty little body dancing like GoGo hey  
But you are unforgettable  
I need to get you alone  
Why not  
A f**king good time never hurt nobody  
I got a little drink but it's not Bacardi  
If you loved your girl then I'm so so sorry  
I got to give it to her like we in a marriage  
Oh like we in a hurry  
No no I won't tell nobody  
You're on your level too  
Tryna do what lovers do  
You ain't enough for me  
Too much for you  
Alone  
Baby go and grab some bad bitches bring them home  
Know the jet's on me  
I'ma curve my best for you  
You know so pick up that dress for me  
You rest on me  
Too much convo for 24 hours  
When you stand next to 24 karats  
She left her man at home  
She don't love him no more  
I want your mind and your body  
Don't mind nobody  
So as long never hurt nobody  
Baby girl work your body  
Work your body  
And you are unforgettable  
I need to get you alone  
Now you wanna chose  
Just pop the bubbly in the 'cuzi  
Right now  
Oh like we in a hurry  
No no I won't tell nobody  
You're on your level too  
Tryna do what lovers do
