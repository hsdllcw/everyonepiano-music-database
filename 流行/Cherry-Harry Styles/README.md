**Cherry双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Cherry_ 是英国男歌手Harry Styles的歌曲，收录在其第二张录音室专辑《Fine
Line》中。Harry曾说，专辑的很多灵感都来源于他的前任。整张专辑都偏暖，音乐表现出来的，少了第一张专辑里金属摇滚的歇斯底里，甚至还有了lullaby民谣，歌词也暖暖的，很好听。

### Cherry歌词：

Harry Styles：  
Don't you call him baby  
We're not talking lately  
Don't you call him what you used to call me  
I I confess I can tell that you are at your best  
I'm selfish so I'm hating it  
I noticed that there's a piece of you in how I dress  
Take it as a compliment  
Don't you call him baby  
We're not talking lately  
Don't you call him what you used to call me  
I I just miss  
I just miss your accent and your friends  
Did you know I still talk to them  
Does he take you walking round his parents' gallery  
Don't you call him baby  
We're not talking lately  
Don't you call him what you used to call me  
Don't you call him baby  
We're not talking lately  
Don't you call him what you used to call me  
Camille Rowe：  
Coucou Tu dors oh j'suis désolée  
Bah non Nan c'est pas marrant  
Ouais On a été à la plage on a  
Parfait
