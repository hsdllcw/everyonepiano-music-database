### Run Rudolph Run歌词：

Out of all the reindeers  
You know you're the mastermind  
Run run Rudolph Randalph ain't too far behind  
Run run Rudolph Santa's got to make it to town  
Santa make him hurry  
Tell him he can take the freeway down  
Run run Rudolph  
'Cause I'm reelin' like a merry-go-round  
Said Santa to a boy child  
"What have you been longing for "  
"All I want for Christmas is a rock-and-roll electric guitar"  
And then away went Rudolph a-whizzing like a shooting star  
Run run Rudolph Santa got to make it to town  
Santa make him hurry  
Tell him he can take the freeway down  
Run run Rudolph wheelin' like a merry-go-round  
Run run Rudolph Santa's got to make it to town  
Santa make him hurry tell him he can take the freeway down  
Run run Rudolph  
I'm reelin' like a merry-go-round  
Said Santa to a girl child  
"What would please you most to get "  
"A little baby doll that can cry sleep drink and wet"  
And then away went Rudolph whizzin' like a Saber jet  
Run run Rudolph Santa's got to make it to town  
Santa make him hurry tell him he can take the freeway down  
Run run Rudolph I'm reelin' like a merry-go-round
