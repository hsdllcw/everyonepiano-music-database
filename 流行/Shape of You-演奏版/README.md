### Shape of You歌词：

The club isn't the best place to find a lover  
So the bar is where I go  
Me and my friends at the table doing shots  
Drinking fast and then we talk slow  
You come over and start up a conversation with just me  
And trust me I'll give it a chance now  
Take my hand stop put Van The Man on the jukebox  
And then we start to dance and now I'm singing like  
Girl you know I want your love  
Your love was handmade for somebody like me  
Come on now follow my lead  
I may be crazy don't mind me  
Say boy let's not talk too much  
Grab on my waist and put that body on me  
Come on now follow my lead  
Come come on now follow my lead  
I'm in love with the shape of you  
We push and pull like a magnet do  
Although my heart is falling too  
I'm in love with your body  
Last night you were in my room  
And now my bed sheets smell like you  
Every day discovering something brand new  
I'm in love with your body  
Oh I oh I oh I oh I  
I'm in love with your body  
Oh I oh I oh I oh I  
I'm in love with your body  
Oh I oh I oh I oh I  
I'm in love with your body  
Every day discovering something brand new  
I'm in love with the shape of you  
One week in we let the story begin  
We're going out on our first date  
You and me are thrifty so go all you can eat  
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate  
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour  
And how your family is doing okay  
Leave and get in a taxi then kiss in the backseat  
Tell the driver make the radio play and I'm singing like  
Girl you know I want your love  
Your love was handmade for somebody like me  
Come on now follow my lead  
I may be crazy don't mind me  
Say boy let's not talk too much  
Grab on my waist and put that body on me  
Come on now follow my lead  
Come come on now follow my lead  
I'm in love with the shape of you  
We push and pull like a magnet do  
Although my heart is falling too  
I'm in love with your body  
And last night you were in my room  
And now my bed sheets smell like you  
Every day discovering something brand new  
I'm in love with your body  
Oh I oh I oh I oh I  
I'm in love with your body  
Oh I oh I oh I oh I  
I'm in love with your body  
Oh I oh I oh I oh I  
I'm in love with your body  
Every day discovering something brand new  
I'm in love with the shape of you  
Come on be my baby come on  
Come on be my baby come on  
Come on be my baby come on  
Come on be my baby come on  
Come on be my baby come on  
Come on be my baby come on  
Come on be my baby come on  
Come on be my baby come on  
I'm in love with the shape of you  
We push and pull like a magnet do  
Although my heart is falling too  
I'm in love with your body  
Last night you were in my room  
And now my bed sheets smell like you  
Every day discovering something brand new  
I'm in love with your body  
Come on be my baby come on  
I'm in love with your body  
Come on be my baby come on  
I'm in love with your body  
Come on be my baby come on  
I'm in love with your body  
Every day discovering something brand new  
I'm in love with the shape of you
