### Livin' on a Prayer歌词：

Tommy used to work on the docks  
Union's been on strike  
Hes down on his luck it's tough so tough  
Gina works the diner all day  
Working for the man she brings home her pay  
For love - for love  
She say:weve got to hold on to what weve got  
'Cause it doesnt make a difference  
If we make it or not  
Weve got each other and thats a lot  
For love - we'll give it a shot  
Oh we're half way there  
Oh livin' on a prayer  
Take my hand and well make it i swear  
Oh livin' on a prayer  
Tommy got his six string in hock  
Now hes holding in what he used  
To make it talk - so tough its tough  
Gina dreams of running away  
When she cries in the night  
Tommy whispers:baby it ok someday  
Weve got to hold on to what weve got  
'Cause it doesnt make a difference  
If we make it or not  
Weve got each other and thats a lot  
For love - we'll give it a shot  
Oh we're half way there  
Oh livin' on a prayer  
Take my hand and we'll make it - i swear  
Oh livin' on a prayer  
Livin' on a prayer  
Weve got to hold on ready or not  
Your live for the fight when it's all that youve got  
Oh we're half way there  
Oh livin' on a prayer  
Take my hand and well make it i swear  
Oh livin' on a prayer  
Oh we're half way there  
Oh livin' on a prayer  
Take my hand and well make it i swear  
Oh livin' on a prayer
