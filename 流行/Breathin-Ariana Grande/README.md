### Breathin歌词：

Some days things just take way too much of my energy  
I look up and the whole room's spinning  
You take my cares away  
I can so overcomplicate people tell me to medicate  
Feel my blood runnin' swear the sky's fallin'  
How do I know if this sh*t's fabricated  
Time goes by and I can't control my mind  
Don't know what else to try but you tell me every time  
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'  
And oh I gotta keep keep on breathin'  
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'  
And oh I gotta keep keep on breathin'  
Sometimes it's hard to find find my way up into the clouds  
Tune it out they can be so loud  
You remind me of a time when things weren't so complicated  
All I need is to see your face  
Feel my blood runnin' swear the sky's fallin'  
How do I know if this sh*t's fabricated oh  
Time goes by and I can't control my mind  
Don't know what else to try but you tell me every time  
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'  
And oh I gotta keep I keep on breathin'  
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'  
And oh I gotta keep I keep on breathin' mmm yeah  
My my air  
My my air  
My my air my air  
My my air  
My my air  
My my air yeah  
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'  
And oh I gotta keep I keep on breathin'  
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'  
And oh I gotta keep I keep on breathin' mmm yeah  
Feel my blood runnin' swear the sky's fallin'  
I keep on breathin'  
Time goes by and I can't control my mind  
I keep on breathin' mmm yeah
