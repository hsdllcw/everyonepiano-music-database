### Renegade歌词：

I tapped on your window on your darkest night  
The shape of you  
Was jagged and weak  
There was nowhere for me to stay  
But I stayed anyway  
And if I would've known  
How many pieces you had crumbled into  
I might have let them lay  
Are you really gonna talk about timing  
In times like these  
And let all your damage  
Damage me  
Carry your baggage up my street  
And make me your future history  
It's time you've come a long way  
Open the blinds  
Let me see your face  
You wouldn't be the first renegade  
To need somebody  
Is it insensitive for me to say  
Get your s**t together  
So I can love you  
Is it really your anxiety  
That stops you from giving me everything  
Or do you just not want to  
I tapped on your window on your darkest night  
The shape of you  
Was jagged and weak  
There was nowhere for me to stay  
But I stayed anyway  
You fire off missiles cause  
You hate yourself  
But do you know you're demolishing me  
Then you squeeze my hand  
As I'm about to leave  
Are you really gonna talk about timing  
In times like these  
And let all your damage  
Damage me  
Carry your baggage up my street  
And make me your future history  
It's time you've come a long way  
Open the blinds  
Let me see your face  
You wouldn't be the first renegade  
To need somebody  
Is it insensitive for me to say  
Get your s**t together  
So I can love you  
Is it really your anxiety  
That stops you from giving me everything  
Or do you just not want to  
And if I would've known  
How sharp the pieces were  
You'd crumbled into  
I might've let them lay  
Are you really gonna talk about timing  
In times like these  
And let all your damage  
Damage me  
Carry your baggage up my street  
And make me your future history  
It's time you've come a long way  
Open the blinds  
Let me see your face  
You wouldn't be the first renegade  
To need somebody  
To need somebody  
To need somebody  
To need somebody  
To need  
Are you really gonna talk about timing  
Is it insensitive for me to say  
In times like these and let all your damage damage me  
Get your s**t together  
Carry your baggage up my street  
So I can love you  
And make me your future history  
Is it really your anxiety  
It's time you've come a long way open the blinds  
That stops you from giving me everything  
Let me see your face you wouldn't be the first renegade  
To need somebody  
Or do you just not want to
