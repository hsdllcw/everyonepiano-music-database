### This Is What You Came For歌词：

Baby, this is what you came for  
Lightning strikes every time she moves  
And everybody’s watching her  
But she’s looking at you, oh, oh  
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh  
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh  
You, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Baby, this is what you came for  
Lightning strikes every time she moves  
And everybody’s watching her  
But she’s looking at you, oh, oh  
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh  
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh  
You, oh, oh, oh, oh  
We go fast ’til they can’t replay  
Who knows why it’s gotta be this way  
We say nothing more than we need  
I say “your place” when we leave  
Baby, this is what you came for  
Lightning strikes every time she moves  
And everybody’s watching her  
But she’s looking at you, oh, oh  
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh  
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh  
You, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Baby, this is what you came for  
Lightning strikes every time she moves  
Yeah  
Baby, this is what you came for  
Lightning strikes every time she moves  
And everybody’s watching her  
But she’s looking at you, oh, oh  
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh  
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh  
You, oh, oh, oh, oh
