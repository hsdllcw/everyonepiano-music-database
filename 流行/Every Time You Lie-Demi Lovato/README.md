### Every Time You Lie歌词：

Now you told me on a Sunday  
That it wasn't gonna work  
I tried to cry myself to sleep  
'Cause it was supposed to hurt  
We sat next to the fire  
As the flame was burning out  
I knew what you were thinking  
Before you'd say it aloud

Don't say you're sorry, 'cause I'm not even breaking  
You're not worth the time that this is taking

I knew better than to let you break my heart  
This soul you'll never see again, won't be showing scars  
You still love her I can see it in your eyes  
The truth is all that I can hear  
Every time you lie

(every time you lie, every time you lie)

I woke up the next morning  
With a smile on my face  
And a long list of gentlemen  
Happy to take your place  
Less trashier, much classier  
Than who you prove to be  
How long's it gonna take before  
You see that she's no me

I knew better than to let you break my heart  
This soul you'll never see again, won't be showing scars (oh no no)  
You still love her I can see it in your eyes  
The truth is all that I can hear  
Every time you lie

At night awake  
I will be sleeping 'til morning breaks  
That's the price you pay for your mistakes  
Goodbye to dreaming

So don't say you're sorry, 'cause I'm not gonna listen

I knew better than to let you break my heart  
This soul you'll never see again, won't be showing scars (oh no no)  
You still love her I can see it in your eyes  
The truth is all that I can hear  
Every time you lie  
Every time you lie  
(Don't say you're sorry, every time you lie)  
Don't say you're sorry (oh)  
The truth is all that I can hear  
Every time you lie
