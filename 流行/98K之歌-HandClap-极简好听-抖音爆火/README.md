### 98K之歌歌词：

Turn it up  
Somebody save your soul cause you've been sinning in the city I know  
Too many troubles all these lovers got you losin' control  
You're like a drug to me a luxury my sugar and gold  
I want the good life  
Every good night you're a hot one to hold  
Cause you don't even know  
I can make your hands clap  
Said I can make your hands clap  
Somebody save your soul cause you've been sinning in the city I know  
Too many troubles all these lovers got you losin' control  
You're like a drug to me a luxury my sugar and gold  
I want your sex and your affection when I'm holding you close  
Cause you don't even know  
I can make your hands clap  
Said I can make your hands clap  
Every night when the stars come out  
Am I the only living soul around  
Need to believe you could hold me down  
Cause I'm in need of something good right now  
We could be screaming till the sun comes out  
And when we wake we be the only sound  
Get off my knees and say a prayer to change vows  
Bet I can make your hands clap  
Bet I can make your hands clap  
Turn it up  
Bet I can make your hands clap  
My fresh is searching for your worst and best don't ever deny  
I'm like a stranger give me danger  
All your wrongs and your rights  
Secrets on broadway to the freeway you're a keeper of crimes  
Feel no conviction grapes of wrath can only sweeten your wine  
But you don't even know  
I can make your hands clap  
Said I can make your hands clap  
Every night when the stars come out  
Am I the only living soul around  
Need to believe you could hold me down  
Cause I'm in need of something good right now  
We could be screaming till the sun comes out  
And when we wake we be the only sound  
Get off my knees and say a prayer to change vows  
Bet I can make your hands clap  
Bet I can make your hands clap  
Bet I can make your hands clap  
Bet I can make your hands clap  
So can I get a hand clap
