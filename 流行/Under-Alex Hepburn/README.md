### Under歌词：

Don't bury me  
Don't let me down  
Don't say it's over  
Cause that would send me under  
Underneath the ground  
Don't say those words  
I wanna live and your words can murder  
Only you can send me under, under, under  
I die every time you walk away  
Don't leave me alone with me  
See, I'm afraid  
Of the darkness and my demons  
And the voices, sayin' nothing's gonna be okay,  
I feel it in my heart, soul, mind that I'm losing  
You, me, you're abusing  
Every reason I have left to live.  
Don't bury me  
Don't let me down  
Don't say it's over  
Cause that would send me under  
Underneath the ground  
Don't say those words  
I wanna live and your words can murder  
Only you can send me under, under, under  
Lost trust, 21 grams of soul  
All the sanity I've ever owned... gone  
But I'm still breathing  
Through the thunder, and the fire, and the madness  
Just to let you shoot me down again  
But I'm still breathing  
I feel it in my veins, skin, bones that I'm losing  
You, me, you're confusing  
Every reason that I've left to live  
Don't bury me  
Don't let me down  
Don't say it's over  
'Cause that would send me under  
Underneath the ground  
Don't say those words  
I wanna live but your words can murder  
Only you can send me under, under, under.  
Chasing you but you don't look back  
Words I threw that I can't take back  
Reaching out but I can't hold on to you, no  
Chasing you but you don't look back  
Words I threw that I can't take back  
Reaching out but I can't hold on to you  
Don't bury me  
Don't let me down  
Don't say it's over  
Cause that would send me under  
Underneath the ground  
Don't say those words  
I wanna live but your words can murder  
Only you can send me under, under, under.
