### Truth Hurts歌词：

Why men great 'til they gotta be great  
Woo  
I just took a DNA test turns out I'm 100 that b***h  
Even when I'm crying crazy  
Yeah I got boy problems that's the human in me  
Bling bling then I solve 'em that's the goddess in me  
You coulda had a bad b***h non-committal  
Help you with your career just a little  
You're 'posed to hold me down but you're holding me back  
And that's the sound of me not calling you back  
Why men great 'til they gotta be great  
Don't text me tell it straight to my face  
Best friend sat me down in the salon chair  
Shampoo press get you out of my hair  
Fresh photos with the bomb lighting  
New man on the Minnesota Vikings  
Truth hurts needed something more exciting  
Bom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay  
You tried to break my heart  
Oh that breaks my heart  
That you thought you ever had it  
No you ain't from the start  
Hey I'm glad you're back with your b***h  
I mean who would wanna hide this  
I will never ever ever ever ever be your side chick  
I put the sing in single  
Ain't worried 'bout a ring on my finger  
So you can tell your friend shoot  
Your shot when you see 'em  
It's OK he already in my DMs  
Why men great 'til they gotta be great  
Don't text me tell it straight to my face  
Best friend sat me down in the salon chair  
Shampoo press get you out of my hair  
Fresh photos with the bomb lighting  
New man on the Minnesota Vikings  
Truth hurts needed something more exciting  
Bom bom bi bom bi dum bum bay  
I'ma hit you back in a minute  
I don't play tag b***h I been it  
We don't f**k with lies we don't do goodbyes  
We just keep it pushing like aye yi yi  
I'ma hit you back in a minute  
I don't play tag b***h I been it  
We don't f**k with lies we don't do goodbyes  
We just keep it pushing like aye yi yi  
Why men great 'til they gotta be great  
Don't text me tell it straight to my face  
Best friend sat me down in the salon chair  
Shampoo press get you out of my hair  
Fresh photos with the bomb lighting  
New man on the Minnesota Vikings  
Truth hurts needed something more exciting  
Bom bom bi bom bi dum bum bay  
Eith the bomb lighting  
Minnesota Vikings  
Aiii yeah
