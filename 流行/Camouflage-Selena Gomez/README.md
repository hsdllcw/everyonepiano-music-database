### Camouflage歌词：

Dead-end streets and boulevards  
You threw in the towel, I broke your heart  
But there's a first time for everything  
Who would've thought you'd feel so cold  
And all these memories seem so old  
To think you were my everything

Remember when we'd talk all night  
But time ain't easy on us, how can love die?

I got so much shit to say  
But I can't help feeling like I'm camouflage  
Fortress around my heart  
You were mine just yesterday  
Now I have no idea who you are  
It's like you camouflage

But it's good to see you here again  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
But it's about half past ten  
And I have to catch my ride

Riding alone on the 405  
And life's so fragile, it's like I could cry  
If that's the last time I'd see you again  
But I'll never tell you just how I felt  
You might just not care, and it might just not help  
What if the feelings just don't make no sense to you, you

Remember when we'd talk all night  
But time ain't easy on us, how can love die?

I got so much shit to say  
But I can't help feeling like I'm camouflage  
Fortress around my heart  
You were mine just yesterday  
Now I have no idea who you are  
It's like you camouflage

But it's good to see you here again  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
But it's about half past ten  
And I have to catch my ride

I got so much shit to say  
But I can't help feeling like I'm camouflage  
Fortress around my heart  
You were mine just yesterday  
Now I have no idea who you are  
It's like you camouflage

But it's good to see you here again  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
But it's about half past ten  
And I have to catch my ride
