### I Would歌词：

Lately I found myself thinking (thinking)  
Been dreaming about you a lot (a lot)  
And up in my head I’m your boyfriend (boyfriend)  
But that’s one thing you’ve already got

He drives to school every morning (morning)  
While I walk alone in the rain (the rain)  
He’d kill me without any warning (warning)  
If he took a look in my brain

Would he say he’s in L-O-V-E?  
Well, if it was me then I would (I would)  
Would he hold you when you’re feeling low?  
Baby, you should know that I would (I would)  
Would he say he’s in L-O-V-E?  
Well, if it was me then I would (I would)  
Would he hold you when you’re feeling low?  
Baby, you should know that I would

Back in my head we were kissing  
I thought things were going alright (alright, alright, alright)  
With a sign on my back saying ‘kick me’  
Reality ruined my life

(On the top of the world!)

It feels like I’m constantly playing  
A game that I’m destined to lose  
'Cause I can’t compete with your boyfriend  
He’s got 27 tattoos

Would he say he’s in L-O-V-E?  
Well, if it was me then I would (I would)  
Would he hold you when you’re feeling low?  
Baby, you should know that I would (I would)  
Would he say he’s in L-O-V-E?  
Well, if it was me then I would (I would)  
Would he hold you when you’re feeling low?  
Baby, you should know that I would (I would, I would)

Would he please you?  
Would he kiss you?  
Would he treat you like I would (I would)?  
Would he touch you?  
Would he need you?  
Would he love you like I would?

Would he say he’s in L-O-V-E?  
Well, if it was me then I would  
Would he hold you when you’re feeling low?  
Baby, you should know that I would

Would he please you? Would he please you?  
Would he kiss you? Would he kiss you?  
Would he treat you like I would (like I would)?  
Would he touch you? Would he touch you?  
Would he need you? Would he need you?  
Would he love you like I would?

Would he say he’s in L-O-V-E?  
Well, if it was me then I would (I would, I would)  
Would he hold you when you’re feeling low?  
Baby, you should know that I would, I would, yeah, I would, yeah.
