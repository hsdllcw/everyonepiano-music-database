### Jump歌词：

i get up  
and nothing gets me down.  
you got it tough  
i've seen the toughest around.  
and i know  
baby, just how you feel.  
you've got to roll with the punches to get to what's real  
oh can't you see me standing here,  
i've got my back against the record machine  
i ain't the worst that you've seen.  
oh can't you see what i mean ?  
might as well jump. jump !  
might as well jump.  
go ahead, jump. jump !  
go ahead, jump.  
aaa-ohh hey you ! how said that ?  
baby how you been ?  
you say you don't know, you won't know  
until we begin.  
well can't you see me standing here,  
i've got my back against the record machine  
i ain't the worst that you've seen.  
oh can't you see what i mean ?  
might as well jump. jump !  
go ahead, jump.  
might as well jump. jump !  
go ahead, jump.  
jump !  
might as well jump. jump !  
go ahead, jump.  
get it and jump. jump !  
go ahead, jump  
jump ! jump !
