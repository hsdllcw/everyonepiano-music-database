### Under the Grave歌词：

Though you haven't heard too much from me  
Like I'm a world apart  
Your mama says you're doing well, I'm so sorry  
I haven't been there  
I got my baby saying now it's okay  
But he knows that it's not okay  
What did I fall off?  
When did my heart go under the grave?  
Baby, I'm something else  
When it all falls down, when it all falls down  
Yeah, I've always been the one who cares for you  
That's there for you  
I know that I've been taking you for granted  
I know that I've been leaving you stranded  
When did my heart go under the grave?  
When did my heart go under the grave?  
When did my heart go under the grave?  
When did my heart go under the grave?  
When did my heart go under the grave?  
When did my heart go under the grave?  
Flash my mind, yeah, I've been captured  
By my greed  
I let it all slip, yeah, let it get  
Away from me  
I got my baby saying now it's okay  
But he knows that it's not okay  
What did I fall off?  
When did my heart go under the grave?  
Baby, I'm something else  
When it all falls down, when it all falls down  
Yeah, I've always been the one who cares for you  
That's there for you  
I know that I've been taking you for granted  
I know that I've been leaving you stranded  
When did my heart go under the grave?  
When did my heart go under the grave?  
When did my heart go under the grave?  
When did my heart go under the grave?  
When did my heart go under the grave?  
When did my heart go under the grave?  
You say you won't forget about me  
Please say you won't forget about me  
When it all goes down  
When it all goes down, down  
Please say you won't forget about me  
Oh baby, I'm something else  
When it all falls down, when it all falls down  
Yeah, I've always been the one who cares for you  
That's there for you  
I know that I've been taking you for granted  
I know that I've been leaving you stranded  
When did my heart go under the grave?  
When did my heart go under the grave?  
When did my heart go under the grave?  
When did my heart go under the grave?  
When did my heart go under the grave?  
When did my heart go under the grave?  
When did my heart go under the grave?  
When did my heart go under the grave?  
When did my heart go under the grave?
