Cool_ 是Gwen Stefani演唱的一首收录在专辑《Love.Angel.Music.Baby》中的一首歌。

  
时间流逝，以前的爱人，最终变成释然的朋友，把一段深深的爱放在心中。Cool是Don't Speak的延续，Gwen和No
Doubt成员，她的初恋情人Tony关系的延续。在Don't
Speak中，Tony提出分手，结束两人7年的恋情，这首歌充满了伤心与痛苦。而在Cool中，多年的恋情终于转化成友情，刻骨铭心的痛苦转化成了衷心的祝福。而Cool电影般的MV,更是对这首歌的最佳诠释。Music,Baby中，Tony也是主创人员之一，虽然年少时的爱情不在了，但他们的友情仍在延续，也算是对初恋情人的一种补偿吧。

### Cool歌词：

It's hard to remember how it felt before  
Now I found the love of my life  
Passes things get more comfortable  
Everything is going right  
And after all the obstacles  
It's good to see you now with someone else  
And it's such a miracle that you and me are still good friends  
After all that we've been through  
I know we're cool  
We used to think it was impossible  
Now I call you by your new last name  
Memories seem like so long ago  
Time always kills the pain  
Remember Propaganda  
And those dreaming days where the mess was made  
Look how all the kids have grown  
Oh, we have changed but we're still the same  
After all that we've been through  
And I'll be happy for you  
If you can be happy for me  
Circles and triangles  
And now we're hanging out with your my boyfriend.  
So far from where we've been  
So far from where we've been  
So far from where we've been  
I know we're cool  
I know we're cool  
Cool Cool...
