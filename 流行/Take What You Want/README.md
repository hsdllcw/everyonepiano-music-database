### Take What You Want歌词：

Post Malone：  
Oh  
Ozzy Osbourne：  
I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone  
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show  
Why don't you take what you want from me  
Take what you need from me  
Take what you want and go  
Why don't you take what you want from me  
Take what you need from me  
Take what you want and go  
Post Malone：  
I never needed anything from you  
And all I ever asked was for the truth  
You showed your tongue and it was forked in two  
Your venom was lethal I almost believed you  
Almost believed you  
Yeah you preyed on my every mistake  
Waited on me to break held me under hopin' I would drown  
Like a plague I was wasting away  
Tryna find my way out find my way out  
And it finally came the day  
I start giving my heart away  
For Heaven's sake my bones will break  
But you never own my soul no  
I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone  
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show  
Why don't you take what you want from me  
Take what you need from me  
Take what you want and go  
Why don't you take what you want from me  
Take what you need from me  
Take what you want and go  
Travis Scott：  
I took them stones you threw made chains for the crew  
Ice  
I brought up 10 h*es this coupe only made for two  
Yeah  
They all ran through it it ain't nothing left to do  
I need some more reasons to live out this evening  
Straight up  
I've been sippin' forever and just taking whatever  
Hoping thinking whenever you'll be back around  
Let's go our ways whichever  
You say how is however long  
'Cause you know I never be alone  
Love  
Love  
Shorty gon' back  
Shorty gon' back  
Need it on sight  
Need it on sight  
Crack it all back  
Crack it all back  
Give her that pipe  
Give her that pipe  
All of my cash  
All of my cash  
Shawty went bad  
Shawty went bad  
Ozzy Osbourne：  
I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone  
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show  
Why don't you take what you want from me  
Take what you need from me  
Take what you want and go  
Why don't you take what you want from me  
Take what you need from me  
Take what you want and go  
Post Malone：  
Take it all away  
Why don't you  
Take what you want take what you need  
Take what you need from me yeah  
Take what you want  
Why don't you  
Take what you need  
What you need yeah
