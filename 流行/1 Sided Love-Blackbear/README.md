### 1 Sided Love歌词：

You're too busy talking over me to hear what I'm saying  
You're too high to realize  
I see through the smile that you're faking  
You're so into yourself everyone else is overrated  
And everything's changing is your heart worth breaking  
One-sided one-sided one-sided love  
Our time is our time is our time is up  
Trying to make this work it ain't enough  
One-sided one-sided one-sided love  
And you don't even notice do you  
Everything perfect to you  
Think you love the idea of us more than the real thing  
Hope your heart don't break too much  
You're too busy talking over me to hear what I'm saying  
You're too high to realize  
I see through the smile that you're faking  
You're so into yourself everyone else is overrated  
And everything's changing is your heart worth breaking  
I'm missing the way that it used to be  
You say I changed maybe you changed me  
I swear lettin' you down lettin' you down is hard enough  
When it's one-sided one-sided one-sided love  
You don't even notice do you  
Everything perfect to you  
Think you love the idea of us more than the real thing  
Hope your heart don't break too much  
You're too busy talking over me to hear what I'm saying  
You're too high to realize  
I see through the smile that you're faking  
You're so into yourself everyone else is overrated  
And everything's changing is your heart worth breaking  
Is your heart worth breaking  
Is your heart worth breaking  
Is your heart worth breaking  
Is your heart worth breaking
