### Drivers License歌词：

I got my driver's license last week  
Just like we always talked about  
'Cause you were so excited for me  
To finally drive up to your house  
But today I drove through the suburbs  
Crying 'cause you weren't around  
And you're probably with that blonde girl  
Who always made me doubt  
She's so much older than me  
She's everything I'm insecure about  
Yeah today I drove through the suburbs  
'Cause how could I ever love someone else  
And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one  
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone  
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me  
'Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street  
And all my friends are tired  
Of hearing how much I miss you but  
I kinda feel sorry for them  
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do yeah  
Today I drove through the suburbs  
And pictured I was driving home to you  
And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one oh-oh  
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone  
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me  
'Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street  
Red lights stop signs  
I still see your face in the white cars front yards  
Can't drive past the places we used to go to  
'Cause I still f**kin' love you babe  
Ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh  
Sidewalks we crossed  
I still hear your voice in the traffic we're laughing  
Over all the noise  
God I'm so blue know we're through  
But I still f**kin' love you babe  
Ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh  
I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one  
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone  
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me  
'Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street  
Yeah you said forever now I drive alone past your street
