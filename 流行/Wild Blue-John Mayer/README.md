### Wild Blue歌词：

Never seen the sun before  
Laying on the ocean floor  
Walking through the wilderness  
And living off the loneliness oh  
Wild blue deeper than I ever knew  
Wild blue on a bed of grey  
Oh baby what a wild blue  
I found myself when I lost you  
Yeah yeah  
All the tears I meant to cry  
Dance across the even sky  
And in my sorrow I can see  
That missing you belongs to me oh  
Wild blue deeper than I ever knew  
Wild blue on a bed of grey  
Oh baby what a wild blue  
I found myself when I lost you  
Wild blue deeper than I ever knew  
It's a wild blue since you went away  
Oh baby what a wild blue  
I found myself when I lost you  
And you'll never know  
The unlikely beauty in letting you go
