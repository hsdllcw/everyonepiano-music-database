### Midnight Memories歌词：

Straight out of the plane to a new hotel  
Just touched down, you could never tell  
Big house party with a crowded kitchen  
People talk sh*t but we don't listen  
Tell me that I'm wrong but I do what I please  
Way too many people in the Allison Lane  
Now I'm at the age when I know what I need, oh wow  
Midnight memories, oh oh oh  
Baby you and me  
Stumbling in the street  
Singing, singing, singing, singing  
Midnight memories, oh oh oh  
Baby where we go?  
Never say no  
Just do it, do it, do it, do it  
5 foot something with the skinny jeans  
Don't look back, baby follow me  
I don't know where I'm going but I'm finding my way  
Same old sh*t but a different day  
Tell me that I'm wrong but I do what I please  
Way too many people in the Allison Lane  
Now I'm at the age when I know what I need, oh wow  
Midnight memories, oh oh oh  
Baby you and me  
Stumbling in the street  
Singing, singing, singing, singing  
Midnight memories, oh oh oh  
Baby where we go?  
Never say no  
Just do it, do it, do it  
You and me and all our friends  
I don't care how much we spend  
Baby this is what the night is, oh, oh, oh  
I know nothing's making sense  
For tonight lets just pretend  
I don't wanna stop till get me oh  
Midnight memories, oh oh oh  
Baby you and me  
Stumbling in the street  
Singing, singing, singing, singing  
Midnight memories, oh oh oh  
Baby where we go?  
Never say no  
Just do it, do it, do it, do it
