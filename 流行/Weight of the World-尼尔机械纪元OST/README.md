### Weight of the World歌词：

I feel like I'm losing hope  
In my body and my soul  
And the sky it looks so ominous  
And as time comes to a halt  
Silence starts to overflow  
My cries are inconspicuous  
Tell me god are you punishing me  
Is this the price I'm paying for my past mistakes  
This is my redemption song  
I need you more than ever right now  
Can you hear me now  
Cause we're going to shout it loud  
Even if our word seem meaningless  
It's like I'm carrying the weight of the world  
I wish that someway somehow  
That I can save every one of us  
But the truth is that I'm only one girl  
Maybe if I keep believing my dreams will come to life  
Come to life  
After all the laughter fades  
Signs of life all washed away  
I can still still feel a gentle breeze  
No matter how hard I pray  
Signs of warning still remain  
And life has become my enemy  
Tell me god are you punishing me  
Is this the price I'm paying for my past mistakes  
This is my redemption song  
I need you more than ever right now  
Can you hear me now  
Cause we're going to shout it loud  
Even if our word seem meaningless  
It's like I'm carrying the weight of the world  
I wish that someway somehow  
That I can save every one of us  
But the truth is that I'm only one girl  
Maybe if I keep believing my dreams will come to life  
Come to life  
Cause we're going to shout it loud  
Even if our word seem meaningless  
It's like I'm carrying the weight of the world  
I wish that someway somehow  
That I can save every one of us  
But the truth is that I'm only one girl  
Still we're going to shout it loud  
Even if our word seem meaningless  
It's like I'm carrying the weight of the world  
I hope that someway somehow  
That I can save every one of us  
But the truth is that I'm only one girl  
Maybe if I keep believing my dreams will come to life  
Come to life
