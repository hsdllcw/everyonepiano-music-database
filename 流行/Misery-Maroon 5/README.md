### Misery歌词：

Oh yeah  
Oh yeah  
So scared of breaking it  
But you won't let it bend  
And I wrote two hundred letters  
I will never send  
Sometimes these cut are so much  
Deeper then they seem  
You'd rather cover up  
I'd rather let them bleed  
So let me be  
I'll set you free  
[CHORUS]  
I am in misery  
There ain't nobody Who can comfort me  
Oh yeah  
Why won't you answer me?  
Your silence is slowly killing me  
Girl you really got me bad  
You really got me bad  
I'm gonna get you back  
I'm gonna get you back  
Your salty skin and how it mixes in with mine  
The way it feels to be completely intertwined  
Not that I didn't care  
It's that I didn't know  
It's not what I didn't feel,  
It's what I didn't show  
So let me be  
I'll set you free  
[CHORUS]  
I am in misery  
There ain't nobody Who can comfort me  
Oh yeah  
Why won't you answer me?  
Your silence is slowly killing me  
Girl you really got me bad  
You really got me bad  
I'm gonna get you back  
I'm gonna get you back  
You say your faith is shaken  
You may be mistaken  
You keep me wide awake and Waiting for the sun  
I'm desperate and confused So far away from you  
I'm getting near  
I don't care where I have to run  
Why do you do what you do to me, yeah  
Why won't you answer me, answer me yeah  
Why do you do what you do to me yeah  
Why won't you answer me, answer me yeah  
[CHORUS]  
I am in misery  
There ain't nobody Who can comfort me  
Oh yeah  
Why won't you answer me?  
Your silence is slowly killing me  
Girl you really got me bad  
You really got me bad  
I'm gonna get you back  
I'm gonna get you back
