### Little Bit of Love歌词：

I've been holding onto pieces  
Swimming in the deep end  
Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needing  
A little bit of love  
A little bit of love a little bit of love  
Lately I've been counting stars  
And I'm sorry that I broke your heart  
It's something that I didn't want for you  
But I'm stepping on broken glass  
And I know this is my final chance  
All I'm tryna do is find my path to you  
I've got voices in my head  
And there's a deafening silence  
I've got voices in my head  
And I can't lie  
I've been holding onto pieces  
Swimming in the deep end  
Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needing  
A little bit of love  
A little bit of love I need a little love  
Just like the air I'm breathing  
These awful wounds ain't healing  
Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needing  
A little bit of love  
A little bit of love a little bit of love a little bit of love  
Lately I've been waking up  
In my dream I stay calling your name  
Stayed up 'til late just thinking of you  
Now I'm knocking on every door  
'Cause I heard you moved from twenty-two  
Has it been that long  
I guess time just flew  
I've got voices in my head  
And there's a deafening silence  
I've got voices in my head  
And I can't lie  
I've been holding onto pieces  
Swimming in the deep end  
Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needing  
A little bit of love  
A little bit of love I need a little love  
Just like the air I'm breathing  
These awful wounds ain't healing  
Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needing  
A little bit of love  
A little bit of love a little bit of love a little bit of love  
I tried to fly but I used my wings too soon  
Now everything I've been thinking of you  
I tried a million times to cut you loose  
I've been holding onto pieces  
Swimming in the deep end  
Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needing  
A little bit of love  
A little bit of love I need a little love  
Just like the air I'm breathing  
These awful wounds ain't healing  
Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needing  
A little bit of love  
A little bit of love a little bit of love a little bit of love
