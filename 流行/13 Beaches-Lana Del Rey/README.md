### 13 Beaches歌词：

I don't belong in the world that's what it is  
Something separates me from other people  
Everywhere I turn there's something blocking my escape  
It took thirteen beaches to find one empty  
But finally it's mine  
With dripping peaches I'm camera ready  
Almost all the time  
But I still get lonely  
And baby only then do I let myself recline  
Can I let go and let your memory dance  
In the ballroom of my mind  
Across the county line  
It hurts to love you but I still love you  
It's just the way I feel  
And I'd be lying if I kept hiding  
The fact that I can't deal  
And that I've been dying  
For something real  
That I've been dying for something real  
It took thirteen beaches to find one empty  
But finally I'm fine  
Past Ventura and lenses plenty  
In the white sunshine  
But you still can find me if you ask nicely  
Underneath the pines with the daisies  
Feeling hazy in the ballroom of my mind  
Across the county line  
It hurts to love you but I still love you  
It's just the way I feel  
And I'd be lying if I kept hiding  
The fact that I can't deal  
And that I've been dying yeah  
For something real  
That I've been dying for something real  
It hurts to love you but I still love you  
It's just the way I feel  
And I'd be lying if I kept hiding  
The fact that I can't deal  
The fact that I can't deal
