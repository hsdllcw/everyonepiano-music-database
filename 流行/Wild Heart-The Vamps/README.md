### Wild Heart歌词：

I was walking away,  
But she's so beautiful it made me stay  
I don't know her name,  
But I'm hoping she might feel the same  
So here I go again,  
She got my heart again!

Tonight we'll dance  
I'll be yours and you'll be mine  
We won't look back,  
Take my hand and we will shine  
Oh, oh, oh  
She needs a wild heart [2x]  
I got a wild heart

Stay here, my dear,  
Feels like I've been standing right here for years  
My mind's beat up  
Tell me that you feel this, and I won't give up  
I won't give up

Tonight we'll dance  
I'll be yours and you'll be mine  
We won't look back,  
Take my hand and we will shine  
Oh, oh, oh  
She needs a wild heart [2x]  
I got a wild heart  
Oh, oh, oh  
She needs a wild heart [2x]  
I got a wild heart

And I know it's late, I know it's cold  
But come right here, I swear I'll never let you go  
The way you move—it's wonderful  
Let's do it now, 'cause one day we'll both be old  
Oh whoa oh

Tonight we'll dance  
I'll be yours and you'll be mine  
We won't look back,  
Take my hand and we will shine  
Oh, oh, oh  
She needs a wild heart [2x]  
I got a wild heart

Tonight we'll dance  
I'll be yours and you'll be mine  
We won't look back,  
Take my hand and we will shine  
Oh, oh, oh  
She needs a wild heart [2x]  
I got a wild heart  
Oh, oh, oh  
She needs a wild heart [2x]  
I've got a wild heart
