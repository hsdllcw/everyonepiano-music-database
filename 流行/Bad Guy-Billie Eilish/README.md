Eilish这位00后小姑娘虽然年纪不大，但她空灵的声线给人一种飘渺、迷幻的感觉，每段旋律、每个咬字都扣人心弦，超出年龄的歌词和感悟很容易拿她和许多同类型的歌手作比较，但显然她是最特别的那一个。

### Bad Guy歌词：

White shirt now red my bloody nose  
Sleepin' you're on your tippy toes  
Creepin' around like no one knows  
Think you're so criminal  
Bruises on both my knees for you  
Don't say thank you or please  
I do what I want when I'm wanting to  
My soul so cynical  
So you're a tough guy  
Like it really rough guy  
Just can't get enough guy  
Chest always so puffed guy  
I'm that bad type  
Make your mama sad type  
Make your girlfriend mad tight  
Might seduce your dad type  
I'm the bad guy duh  
I'm the bad guy  
I like it when you take control  
Even if you know that you don't  
Own me I'll let you play the role  
I'll be your animal  
My mommy likes to sing along with me  
But she won't sing this song  
If she reads all the lyrics  
She'll pity the men I know  
So you're a tough guy  
Like it really rough guy  
Just can't get enough guy  
Chest always so puffed guy  
I'm that bad type  
Make your mama sad type  
Make your girlfriend mad tight  
Might seduce your dad type  
I'm the bad guy duh  
I'm the bad guy duh  
I'm only good at bein' bad bad  
I like when you get mad  
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone  
You said she's scared of me  
I mean I don't see what she sees  
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne  
I'm a bad guy  
I'm a bad guy  
Bad guy bad guy  
I'm a bad
