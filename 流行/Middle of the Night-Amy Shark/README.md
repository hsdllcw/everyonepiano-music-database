### Middle of the Night歌词：

Take back what you said  
You mess up my head  
Gotta see someone about the pains in my chest  
We made plans to move out  
Boxes all inside out  
And I waited at the front for you  
A million times in the middle of the night  
I'll pick you up each time you call  
Savour all your letters too  
To save me  
To save me from myself  
Myself  
F**k my life  
F**k my life  
I want you back all the time  
I think about you all night  
F**k my life  
F**k my life  
Ohh maybe I should try to sit up  
Every time I eat  
All I want to do is throw up on my body  
On my life  
Swear on a double edged silver knife  
I'm all over  
I'm all tears  
I'm backdated  
I'll take years  
To get back pretty  
Get back time  
Call you f**ked up late at night  
F**k my life  
F**k my life  
I want you back all the time  
I think about you all night  
F**k my life  
F**k my life  
I helped you paint your room white  
We breathed in the fumes all night  
F**k my life  
F**k my life  
I want you back all the time  
I think about you all night  
Take back what you said  
You mess up my head  
Gotta see someone about the pains in my chest  
We made plans to move out  
Boxes all inside out  
And I know that you still love me too  
Just a little bit less than you used to  
Kill all of the plants inside  
Have friends 'round all the time  
Time time time time time time time  
F**k my life  
F**k my life  
I want you back all the time  
I think about you all night  
F**k my life  
F**k my life  
I helped you paint your room white  
We breathed in the fumes all night  
F**k my life  
F**k my life  
I want you back all the time  
I think about you all night  
My life  
My life  
I want you back all the time  
I think about you all
