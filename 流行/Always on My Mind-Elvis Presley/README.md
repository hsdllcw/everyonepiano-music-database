### Always on My Mind歌词：

Maybe I didn't treat you  
Quite as good as I should have  
Maybe I didn't love you  
Quite as often as I could have  
Little things I should have said and done  
I just never took the time

You were always on my mind  
You were always on my mind

Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died  
Give me, give me one more chance  
To keep you satisfied, satisfied

Maybe I didn't hold you  
All those lonely, lonely times  
And I guess I never told you  
I'm so happy that you're mine  
If I make you feel second best  
Girl, I'm sorry I was blind

You were always on my mind  
You were always on my mind

Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died  
Give me, give me one more chance  
To keep you satisfied, satisfied

Little things I should have said and done  
I just never took the time  
You were always on my mind  
You are always on my mind  
You are always on my mind
