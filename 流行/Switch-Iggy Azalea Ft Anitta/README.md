### Switch歌词：

[Iggy Azalea:]  
Uh  
It's Iggy Iggs!  
What you want  
Look, look  
Kick in the door, wavin' the four fizzy  
They already know they can't fuck with Iggy  
True's cost more than the rent do, you know that  
All black on when I come through, it's Kodak  
Mirror, mirror on the wall  
Is Iggy the ziggy-iggy the baddest of 'em all?  
Why you come through, shut down the mall?  
All that ass deserve an applause  
[Anitta (Iggy Azalea):]  
Change the game (Change it up, change it up now)  
Switch it up again (Switch it up, switch it up now)  
Then I go again (Here we go, here we go)  
Play your role, play your ro-o-ole  
Fantasy (Fantasy)  
Turns reality (Turn reality)  
Right in front of me (Right in front of me)  
I can have it anyway I want  
[Iggy Azalea:]  
Red light, yellow light, green light  
Switch!  
This is 'bout the time you recognize that I'm that  
Bitch!  
This is all that sauce your mama said you couldn't  
Get!  
Red light, yellow light, green light  
Switch!  
Me and my boo on a worldwide hustle  
You know what it is when I flex that muscle  
I don't even know what a real one do  
Talk that talk, I can back it up too  
Got yo dessert, call me the waiter  
I'm flirtin', you get it later  
You could get it from the inside out  
No hands, you could put it in your mouth  
[Anitta (Iggy Azalea):]  
Change the game (Change it up, change it up now)  
Switch it up again (Switch it up, switch it up now)  
Then I go again (Here we go, here we go)  
Play your role, play your ro-o-ole  
Fantasy (Fantasy)  
Turns reality (Turn reality)  
Right in front of me (Right in front of me)  
I can have it anyway I want  
[Iggy Azalea:]  
Red light, yellow light, green light  
Switch!  
This is 'bout the time you recognize that I'm that  
Bitch!  
This is all that sauce your mama said you couldn't  
Get!  
Red light, yellow light, green light  
Switch!  
It's Iggy bitches  
What you want?  
What you want want want?  
Switch it up, the Lamb, the Bentley truck  
He don't love you, that ring ain't big enough  
If they talkin' that money I'm showing up  
My account getting bigger, it's growing up  
And I'm still a ma'fuckin' rockstar  
Popstar but I roll with the mobsters  
Yacht club on the shore eating lobster  
While I'm stunting in Geneva with my top off  
Red light, yellow light, green light  
Switch!  
This is 'bout the time you recognize that I'm that  
Bitch!  
This is all that sauce your mama said you couldn't  
Get!  
Red light, yellow light, green light  
Switch!  
Red light, yellow light, green light  
This is 'bout the time you recognize that I'm that  
This is all that sauce your mama said you couldn't  
Red light, yellow light, green light  
Switch!
