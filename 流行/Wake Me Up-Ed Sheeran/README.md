### Wake Me Up歌词：

I should ink my skin with your name  
And take my passport out again  
And just replace it  
See I could do without a tan  
On my left hand,  
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle  
And I should run you a hot bath  
And fill it up with bubbles

'Cause maybe you're loveable  
And maybe you're my snowflake  
And your eyes turn from green to gray  
In the winter I'll hold you in a cold place  
And you should never cut your hair  
'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder

And you will never know  
Just how beautiful you are to me  
But maybe I'm just in love  
When you wake me up

And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me?  
Could you make me a cup of tea to open my eyes in the right way?  
And I know you love Shrek  
‘Cause we've watched it 12 times  
But maybe you're hoping for a fairy tale too  
And if your DVD breaks today  
You should've got a VCR  
Because I've never owned a Blue ray, true say

And now I always been shit at computer games  
And your brother always beats me  
And if I lost, I’d go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV  
And then you’d laugh at me  
And be asking me  
If I'm gonna be home next week  
And then you'd lie with me 'til I fall asleep  
And flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets

And you will never know  
Just how beautiful you are to me  
But maybe I'm just in love  
When you wake me up

And I think you hate the smell of smoke  
You always try to get me to stop  
But you drink as much as me  
And I get drunk a lot  
So I'll take you to the beach  
And walk along the sand  
And I'll make you a heart pendant  
With a pebble held in my hand  
And I'll carve it like a necklace  
So the heart falls where your chest is  
And now a piece of me is a piece of the beach  
And it falls just where it needs to be  
And rests peacefully  
So you just need to breathe  
To feel my heart against yours now, against yours now

‘Cause maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up  
Or maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up  
Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up
