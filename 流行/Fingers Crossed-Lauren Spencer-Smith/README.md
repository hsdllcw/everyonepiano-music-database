### Fingers Crossed歌词：

Introduced me to your family  
Watched my favorite shows on your TV  
Made me breakfast in the morning  
When you got home from work  
Making plans to travel 'round the world  
Said we'd always put each other first  
Old love songs we used to play to  
Funny now I hate you  
Now I remember when you'd call me late at night  
I gave you my hours and advice  
Just tryna fix you and all your daddy issues  
But now I don't even miss you anymore  
So I I want all the tears back that I cried  
All the hours spent giving advice  
On how to write your songs  
All you did was prove me wrong  
When you said you loved me  
Well you must've had your fingers crossed  
Should've paid attention to my friends  
Telling me how bad it's gonna end  
Always giving their opinions  
Now I wish I would have listened  
I could say I'm sorry but I'm not  
You don't deserve the one thing that you lost  
Now I remember when you'd call me late at night  
And I gave you my hours and advice  
Just tryna fix you and all your daddy issues  
But now I don't even miss you anymore  
So I I want all the tears back that I cried  
All the hours spent giving advice  
On how to write your songs  
All you did was prove me wrong  
When you said you loved me  
Well you must've had your fingers crossed  
Oh-oh oh-oh  
Your fingers crossed  
Oh-oh oh-oh  
Your fingers crossed  
Oh-oh oh-oh  
Oh when you said you loved me  
Well you must've had your fingers crossed  
Oh I I want all the tears back that I cried  
All the hours spent giving advice  
On how to write your songs  
All you did was prove me wrong  
Wish you said you loved me  
When you didn't have your fingers crossed
