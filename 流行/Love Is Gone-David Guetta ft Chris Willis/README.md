### Love Is Gone歌词：

Now that the love is gone  
What are we supposed to do  
After all that we've been through  
When everything that felt so right is wrong  
Now that the love is gone?  
Love is gone  
What are we supposed to do  
After all that we've been through  
When everything that felt so right is wrong  
Now that the love is gone?  
There is nothing left to prove  
No use to deny this simple truth  
Can't find the reason to keep holding on  
Now that the love is gone, love is gone  
Now that the love is gone  
What felt so right's so wrong  
Now that the love is gone  
I feel so hurt inside  
Feel so hurt inside  
Got to find the reason  
What are we supposed to do  
After all that we've been through  
When everything that felt so right is wrong  
Now that the love is gone?  
There is nothing left to prove  
No use to deny this simple truth  
Can't find the reason to keep holding on  
Now that the love is gone, love is gone  
Got to find a reason  
Got to find a reason  
Got to find a reason to hold  
Love, there's nothing left for us to say, yeah  
Love, why can't we turn and walk away?  
What are we supposed to do  
After all that we've been through  
When everything that felt so right is wrong  
Now that the love is gone?  
There is nothing left to prove  
No use to deny this simple truth  
Can't find the reason to keep holding on  
Now that the love is gone, love is gone  
Love is gone
