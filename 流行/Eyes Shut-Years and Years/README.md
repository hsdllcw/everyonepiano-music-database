### Eyes Shut歌词：

Throw your heart to me  
Let it fall and hit the ground  
Let it go  
Your timing was so wrong  
I just want to be found

And Ooh...  
And I…

Yeah, I've got the lines  
I've got the lines

Oh it's brighter this time  
This type of mine  
This disguise  
Oh you talk, ooh, to me

Well, nothing's gonna hurt me with my eyes shut  
I can see through them  
I can see through them  
I am drawing pictures I'm evading  
I will not use them  
I will not use them  
Again

And it starts again  
You come over with your friends  
I don't wanna talk to them  
And all I really want  
Is to start again

And oh...  
And I…

Yeah, I've got the lines  
I've got the lines

Oh it's brighter this time  
This type of mine  
This disguise  
Oh you talk, ooh, to me

Well, nothing's gonna hurt me with my eyes shut  
I can see through them  
I can see through them  
I am drawing pictures I'm evading  
I will not use them  
I will not use them

[2x]  
'Cause I wanna be bigger than life  
For you  
For you

And nothing's gonna hurt me with my eyes shut  
I can see through them  
I can see through them  
And I am drawing pictures I'm evading  
I will not use them  
I will not use them

No, nothing's gonna hurt me with my eyes shut  
I can see through them  
I can see through them
