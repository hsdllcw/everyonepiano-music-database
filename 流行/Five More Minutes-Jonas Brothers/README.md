### Five More Minutes歌词：

Nick Jonas：  
Give me five more minutes  
Baby I'm not finished loving you  
I don't wanna end it when we're only just beginning  
Give me five more minutes  
Aw yeah  
Right now you just look too good to me  
I cannot fathom letting you leave  
You've got important places to be  
Mmm-mmm  
Just please not yet  
Please not yet  
Give me five more minutes  
Yeah  
Baby I'm not finished loving you  
I don't wanna end it when we're only just beginning  
Give me five more minutes  
Ooh yeah ooh  
Joe Jonas：  
Wait  
Do you think you could just wait a while  
Mmm-mmm  
I think I could make it worth your while  
Mmm-mmm  
I know that bein' late ain't your style  
But please say "Yes"  
Please say "Yes"  
Nick Jonas：  
Give me five more minutes  
Hey yeah baby  
Baby I'm not finished loving you  
I don't wanna end it when we're only just beginning  
Give me five more minutes  
Just five more  
Aw yeah  
Come on ooh  
Please say "Yes"  
Please say "Yes"  
Please say "Yes yes yes"  
Oh  
Please say "Yes"  
Please say  
Please say "Yes"  
Give me five more minutes  
Five more minutes holding you  
Baby I'm not finished and we're only just beginning  
Give me five more minutes
