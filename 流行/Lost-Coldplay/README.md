**Lost!双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Lost!_ 是英国摇滚乐坛进入新世纪之后崛起的最受欢迎的摇滚乐队之一Coldplay的歌曲。收录在其专辑Viva la Vida or Death
and All His Friends中。

自从Coldplay极具创新精神的《Viva la Vida or Death and All His
Friends》发表之后，这支在英伦摇滚乐界占有特殊地位的乐队，开拓了他们音乐生涯的新航程，从音乐本身的寓意到编曲，这张专辑当中的歌曲都更强调大气和开阔的氛围环境，这使得“Viva
la Vida”巡回演唱会相较于Coldplay之前的演唱会要更注重现场的器乐编排，而非仅仅只是Chris
Martin在演唱时的个人煽动性，所以，尽管不怎么擅长现场演唱的Chris Martin，在这张现场专辑当中的九首歌里，也展现了非常令人血脉喷张的激情。

### Lost!歌词：

Just because I'm losing  
Doesn't mean I'm lost  
Doesn't mean I'll stop  
Doesn't mean I would cross

Just because I'm hurting  
Doesn't mean I'm hurt  
Doesn't mean I didn't get  
What I deserved  
No better and no worse

I just got lost  
Every river that I tried to cross  
Every door I ever tried was locked  
Ohhh and I'm...  
Just waiting 'til the shine wears off

You might be a big fish  
In a little pond  
Doesn't mean you've won  
'Cause along may come  
A bigger one

And you'll be lost  
Every river that you tried to cross  
Every gun you ever held went off  
Ohhh and I'm...  
Just waiting 'til the firing stopped  
Ohhh and I'm...  
Just waiting 'til the shine wears off

[Guitar solo]

Ohhh and I'm...  
Just waiting 'til the shine wears off  
Ohhh and I'm...  
Just waiting 'til the shine wears off
