### Lust For Life歌词：

[Lana Del Rey:]  
Climb up the H  
Of the Hollywood sign, yeah  
In these stolen moments  
The world is mine (duwop, duwop)  
There's nobody here  
Just us together (shuwop, shuwop)  
Keepin' me hot  
Like July forever  
'Cause we're the masters of our own fate  
We're the captains of our own souls  
There's no way for us to come away  
'Cause boy we're gold, boy we're gold  
And I was like...  
[Lana Del Rey & The Weeknd:]  
Take off, take off  
Take off all your clothes  
Take off, take off  
Take off all your clothes  
Take off, take off  
Take off all of your clothes  
They say only the good die young  
That just ain't right  
'Cause we're having too much fun  
Too much fun tonight, yeah  
And a lust for life, and a lust for life  
And a lust for life, and a lust for life  
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive  
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive  
And a lust for life, and a lust for life  
And a lust for life, and a lust for life  
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive  
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive  
Then, we dance on the H  
Of the Hollywood sign, yeah  
'Til we run out of breath  
Gotta dance 'til we die (duwop, duwop)  
My boyfriend's back  
And he's cooler than ever (shuwop, shuwop)  
There's no more night  
Blue skies forever  
[The Weeknd:]  
'Cause we're the masters of our own fate  
We're the captains of our own souls  
So there's no need for us to hesitate  
We're all alone, let's take control  
And I was like...  
[The Weeknd & Lana Del Rey:]  
Take off, take off  
Take off all your clothes  
Take off, take off  
Take off all your clothes  
Take off, take off  
Take off all of your clothes  
They say only the good die young  
That just ain't right  
'Cause we're having too much fun  
Too much fun tonight, yeah  
And a lust for life, and a lust for life  
And a lust for life, and a lust for life  
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive  
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive  
And a lust for life, and a lust for life  
And a lust for life, and a lust for life  
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive  
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive  
My boyfriend's back  
And he's cooler than ever  
There's no more night  
Blue skies forever  
I told you twice  
In our love letter  
There's no stopping now  
Green lights forever  
And I was like...  
[Lana Del Rey:]  
Take off, take off  
Take off all your clothes  
Take off, take off  
Take off all your clothes  
Take off, take off  
Take off all of your clothes  
[Lana Del Rey & The Weeknd:]  
And a lust for life, and a lust for life  
And a lust for life, and a lust for life  
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive  
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive  
And a lust for life, and a lust for life  
And a lust for life, and a lust for life  
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive  
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
