**Viva la Vida**
是英国摇滚乐队酷玩乐队ColdPlay演唱的歌曲。由克里斯•马汀、强尼•巴克兰、盖•贝瑞曼和威尔•查平填词谱曲，收录在酷玩乐队第四张录音室专辑《Viva
La Vida Or Death And All His Friends》中，于2008年5月25日通过Parlophone唱片和Capitol唱片发布。

歌曲以路易十六世的口吻叙述了一段苍凉悲怆的历史，曲风却异常欢快激昂，如同进行曲般的弦乐伴奏充满了激情，前后的反差衍生出的是豁达壮丽，不禁令人热泪盈眶。《
_Viva La Vida_ 》在如柴可夫斯基般的行板中层层推进，激昂的弦乐再次取代吉他成为了乐章里呼风唤雨的角色。

### Viva la Vida歌词：

I used to rule the world  
Seas would rise when I gave the word  
Now in the morning I sleep alone  
Sweep the streets I used to own  
I used to roll the dice  
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes  
Listen as the crowd would sing  
Now the old king is dead  
Long live the king  
One minute I held the key  
Next the walls were closed on me  
And I discovered that my castles stand  
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand  
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing  
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing  
Be my mirror my sword and shield  
My missionaries in a foreign field  
For some reason I can't explain  
Once you go there was never  
Never an honest word  
But that was when I ruled the world  
It was the wicked and wild wind  
Blew down the doors to let me in  
Shattered windows and the sound of drums  
People couldn't believe what I'd become  
Revolutionaries wait  
For my head on a silver plate  
Just a puppet on a lonely string  
Oh who would ever want to be king  
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing  
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing  
Be my mirror my sword and shield  
My missionaries in a foreign field  
For some reason I can't explain  
I know Saint Peter won't call my name  
Never an honest word  
But that was when I ruled the world  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
Hear Jerusalem bells are ringing  
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing  
Be my mirror my sword and shield  
My missionaries in a foreign field  
For some reason I can't explain  
I know Saint Peter won't call my name  
Never an honest word  
But that was when I ruled the world
