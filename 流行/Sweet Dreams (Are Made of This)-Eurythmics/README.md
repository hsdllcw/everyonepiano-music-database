### Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)歌词：

Sweet dreams are made of this  
Who am I to disagree  
I travel the world and the seven seas  
Everybody's looking for something

Some of them want to use you  
Some of them want to get used by you  
Some of them want to abuse you  
Some of them want to be abused

Sweet dreams are made of this  
Who am I to disagree  
I travel the world and the seven seas  
Everybody's looking for something

Hold your head up, keep your head up, movin' on  
Hold your head up, movin' on, keep your head up, movin' on  
Hold your head up, movin' on, keep your head up, movin' on  
Hold your head up, movin' on, keep your head up

Some of them want to use you  
Some of them want to get used by you  
Some of them want to abuse you  
Some of them want to be abused

Hold your head up, keep your head up, movin' on  
Hold your head up, movin' on, keep your head up, movin' on  
Hold your head up, movin' on, keep your head up, movin' on  
Hold your head up, movin' on, keep your head up

Sweet dreams are made of this  
Who am I to disagree  
I travel the world and the seven seas  
Everybody's looking for something

Sweet dreams are made of this  
Who am I to disagree  
I travel the world and the seven seas  
Everybody's looking for something

Sweet dreams are made of this  
Who am I to disagree  
I travel the world and the seven seas  
Everybody's looking for something

Sweet dreams are made of this  
Who am I to disagree  
I travel the world and the seven seas  
Everybody's looking for something
