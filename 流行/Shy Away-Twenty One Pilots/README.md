### Shy Away歌词：

When I get home  
You better not be there  
We're placin' bets you won't  
Shed your modesty  
And the only thing to leave behind  
Is your own skin on the floor  
Don't you shy away  
Ah-ah-ah  
Manifest a ceiling  
When you shy away  
Ah-ah-ah  
Searchin' for that feelin'  
Just like an "I love you"  
Ooh ooh  
That isn't words  
Ooh ooh  
Like a song he wrote that's never heard  
Ah-ah-ah  
Don't you  
Ssh  
When you get home  
You barely recognize the pictures  
They put in a frame  
'Cause you shed your modesty  
Don't circle the track  
Take what you have  
And leave your skin on the floor  
Don't you shy away  
Ah-ah-ah  
Manifest a ceiling  
When you shy away  
Ah-ah-ah  
Searchin' for that feelin'  
Just like an "I love you"  
Ooh ooh  
That isn't words  
Ooh ooh  
Like a song he wrote  
Ah-ah-ah  
That's never heard  
When I get home  
Boy you better not be there  
You're long gone  
You shed your modesty  
Don't circle the track  
Just break the cycle in half  
And leave your skin on the floor  
Don't you shy away  
Ah-ah-ah  
Manifest a ceiling  
When you shy away  
Ah-ah-ah  
Searchin' for that feelin'  
Just like an "I love you"  
Ooh ooh  
That isn't words  
Ooh ooh  
Like a song he wrote  
Ah-ah-ah  
That's never heard  
That's never heard  
Ah-ah-ah ah-ah-ah  
An "I love you"  
That isn't words  
Like a song he wrote  
That's never heard  
Don't you shy away
