### Only One歌词：

As I lay me down to sleep  
I hear her speak to me  
Hello 'Mari, how ya doin'?  
I think the storm ran out of rain, the clouds are movin'  
I know you're happy, cause I can see it  
So tell the voice inside ya' head to believe it  
I talked to God about you, he said he sent you an angel  
And look at all that he gave you  
You asked for one and you got two  
You know I never left you  
Cause every road that leads to heaven's right aside you  
So I can say

Hello my only one  
Just like the morning sun  
You keep on rising till the sky knows your name  
Hello my only one  
Remember who you are  
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Oh the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day  
Remember how I'd say, hey, hey, one day  
You'll be the man you always knew you could be  
And if you knew how proud I was  
You'd never shed a tear, have a fear  
No you wouldn't do that  
And though I didn't pick the day to turn the page  
I know it's not the end every time I see her face  
And I hear you say

Hello my only one  
Remember who you are  
You got the world cause you got the love in your hands  
And you're still my chosen one  
So can you understand  
One day you'll understand

So hear me out, hear me out  
I won't go, I won't go  
No goodbyes, no goodbyes  
Just hello, just hello  
And when you cry, I will cry  
And when you smile, I will smile  
And next time when I look in your eyes  
We'll have wings and we'll fly

Hello my only one  
Just like the morning sun  
You keep on rising till the sky knows your name  
And you're still my chosen one  
Remember who you are  
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori  
I just want you to do me a favor

Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me  
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me  
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me  
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me  
Tell Nori about me...
