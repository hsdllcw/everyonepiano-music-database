_Run_
这首歌节奏轻快，整首歌传达出了自由的主旨，这也是Human中想要对人性的探求与思考。歌曲节奏感很强，特别是Run的反复咏叹，也是对歌曲主旨的一种表现方式：反抗世界，渴望自由。主唱十分稳健的声音，配上女声和声，也是本歌曲的一大亮点。

### Run歌词：

When I was a young boy living in the city  
All I did was run run run run run  
Staring at the lights they look so pretty  
Momma said "son son son son son  
You're gonna grow up you're gonna get old  
All that glitters don't turn to gold  
But until then just have your fun  
Boy run run run run run"  
Yeah run run run  
Run run run  
When I was a young kid living in the city  
All I did was pay pay pay pay pay  
And every single dime that good Lord gave me  
I could make it last three four five days  
Living it up but living down low  
Chasing that luck before I get old  
And looking back oh we had some fun  
Boy run run run run run  
They tell you that the sky might fall  
They'll say that you might lose it all  
So I run until I hit that wall  
Yeah I learned my lesson count my blessings  
Look to the rising sun and run run run  
Yeah one day well the sky might fall  
Yeah one day I could lose it all  
So I run until I hit that wall  
If I learned one lesson count your blessings  
Look to the rising sun and run run run  
Run run run  
Didn't get everything that I wanted  
But I got what I need yeah yeah  
I see that light in the morning  
Shining down on me  
So take me up high take me down low  
Where it all ends nobody knows  
But until then let's have some fun yeah  
Run run run run run  
They tell you that the sky might fall  
They'll say that you might lose it all  
So I run until I hit that wall  
Yeah I learned my lesson count my blessings  
Look to the rising sun and run run run  
Yeah one day well the sky might fall  
Yeah one day I could lose it all  
So I run until I hit that wall  
If I learned one lesson count your blessings  
Look to the rising sun and run run run  
Run run run  
Yeah run run run  
Yeah I learned my lesson count my blessings  
Look to the rising sun  
Yeah I learned my lesson count my blessings  
Look to the rising sun  
Yeah if I learned one lesson count your blessings  
Look to the rising sun yeah run run run
