Sacrifice歌词：

  

It's a human sign  
When things go wrong  
When the scent of her lingers  
And temptation's strong  
Into the boundary  
Of each married man  
Sweet deceit comes calling  
And negativity lands  
Cold, cold heart  
Hard done by you  
Some things lookin' better, baby  
Just passin' through  
And it's no sacrifice  
Just a simple word  
It's two hearts livin'  
In two separate world  
But, it's no sacrifice  
No sacrifice  
It's no sacrifice, at all  
Mutual misunderstandin'  
After the fact  
Sensitivity builds a prison  
In the final act  
We lose direction  
No stone unturned  
No tears to damn you  
When jealousy hurts  
Cold, cold heart  
Hard done by you  
Some things lookin' better, baby  
Just passin' through  
And it's no sacrifice  
Just a simple word  
It's two hearts livin'  
In two separate world  
But, it's no sacrifice  
No sacrifice  
It's no sacrifice, at all  
Cold, cold heart  
Hard done by you  
Some things lookin' better, baby  
Just passin' through  
And it's no sacrifice  
Just a simple word  
It's two hearts livin'  
In two separate world  
But, it's no sacrifice  
No sacrifice  
It's no sacrifice, at all  
No sacrifice, at all  
No sacrifice, at all  
No sacrifice, at all  
No sacrifice, at all
