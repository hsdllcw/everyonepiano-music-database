### Don't Want You Back歌词：

Baby, you can go about your business  
No use in waiting up for me at night  
The only thing that is on my wish list  
Don't take another second of my time  
Little man, now can't you see?  
I'm so done with you and me  
Sick of living fantasies  
It's not right, it's not life  
You've been blind and so naive  
You can't escape reality  
You're not the man of my dreams tonight, no lie  
Don't want you back, back, back, back  
No point in begging on your knees  
Nothing that I haven't seen before  
Don't want you back, back, back, back  
I'm done with all this, "Baby, please"  
You ain't gonna fuck with me, no more  
Don't want you back, back, back, back  
No point in begging on your knees  
Nothing that I haven't seen before  
Don't want you back, back, back, back  
I'm done with all this, "Baby, please"  
You ain't gonna fuck with me, no more  
Heey-heey  
Don't want you back  
Heey-heey  
Heey-heey  
Don't want you back  
Heey-heey  
You could never end a war with flowers  
Decent love will overshadow hate  
Our love has joined a new world, going better  
Sick of burning candles in the rain  
Little man, now can't you see?  
I'm so done with you and me  
Sick of living fantasies  
It's not right, it's not life  
You've been blind and so naive  
You can't escape reality  
You're not the man of my dreams tonight, no lie  
Don't want you back, back, back, back  
No point in begging on your knees  
Nothing that I haven't seen before  
Don't want you back, back, back, back  
I'm done with all this, "Baby, please"  
You ain't gonna fuck with me, no more  
Don't want you back, back, back, back  
No point in begging on your knees  
Nothing that I haven't seen before  
Don't want you back, back, back, back  
I'm done with all this, "Baby, please"  
You ain't gonna fuck with me, no more  
All this toxic conversation  
Every word has gone to waste  
Is your bitter medication  
Let me know how that taste  
I come to a realization  
You're just in love with the chase  
Best believe you tried my patience  
Ended up hands at stake  
Don't want you back, back, back, back  
No point in begging on your knees  
Nothing that I haven't seen before  
Don't want you back, back, back, back  
I'm done with all this, "Baby, please"  
You ain't gonna fuck with me, no more  
Don't want you back, back, back, back  
No point in begging on your knees  
Nothing that I haven't seen before  
Don't want you back, back, back, back  
I'm done with all this, "Baby, please"  
You ain't gonna fuck with me, no more
