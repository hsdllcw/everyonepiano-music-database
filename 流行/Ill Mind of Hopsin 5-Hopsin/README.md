### Ill Mind of Hopsin 5歌词：

Man I hate rap  
But if the shoe fit's, wear it  
I've become a freak of nature all of kids stare at  
Walk around bumping raw,with the shit blaring  
Saying'fuck school' and dropping out like a miscarriage  
I'm embarrassed, and I'm ashamed I played a part in this devilish game,  
Making ya common sense perish,  
But I ain't taking the full blame,  
Cuz most of you chumps running around here ain't never had strict parents.  
All of your brain cells rotting from weed,  
Feeling like if you ain't got it life's not as complete.  
You having sex with every mother fucking body you see,  
with a past so dark, that Satan would jump out of his seat.  
Still you out on these streets, thinking you as hot as can be,  
Without the knowledge to lead,  
So you just follow the sheep.  
Making sure your name and swag is all polished and clean,  
While your favorite is like'Yeah he got it from me'.  
You've been brainwashed, by a fake life that you're used to living  
When i say fun, What do you envision?  
Prolly drinking and smoking out with your crew and chillin, with clueless
woman you trying to bang  
Bump, a new addition.  
Is that all you think life really is?  
Well if so.., Then you're a fucking idiot.  
I honestly feel like grabbing you're head and hitting it,  
Matter fact you don't even deserve a brain.. GIMME IT!.  
Do you even have any goals,  
Aside from bagging these hoes and packing the bowl,  
Well lemme guess.. NO!!  
You're only in school, because you're parents made you go,  
and all you do is play beer pong and hang out with your bro's.  
Yo, society has got you living for a whack cause,  
You're a fucking adult with no skills AT ALL!  
You don't read any books or play ball,  
you don't draw you literally do nothing AT ALL!  
Still you fiend for the glamorous fruits,  
you don't have because you idolize rappers that do.  
And all they say is'I got money and it's stacked to the roof',  
and now you think it's just going to magically happen to you.. HOW?  
Yo lazy ass don't commit to labour,  
you pick something up, try it out and put it down two minutes later.  
And then you complain about your life because it ain't getting catered,  
now who ever trys to call you out on your bullshit's a hater?  
You wanna succeed, you have to try.  
Or one day you'll get older and regret it all because you can't provide.  
Your friends are low lifes, don't act surprised.  
Look, just cut the bad fruit off of the tree, make the sacrifice  
Girls, Stop acting like you want a guy with trait's like Romeo,  
You always talk about how'every man's fake,  
and you can't take it, and you want something real'.  
Shut up, tramp save it.  
Twice a week you put on you're make up and damn places,  
From here to the club, half naked with ya ass shaking.  
Pulling a low life nigga, who claim he cash making.  
So you let him hit, find out he work at the gas station.  
One of them niggas got you pregnant, and you can't raise it.  
But you caused it, your action's made a fat statement.  
You want romeo then act patient,  
And stop frontin' like he in the club, posting in the back waiting.  
It's the club, where the guys put on a new persona,  
they go to looking for beautiful, brainless, bitches like you to bone them.  
Then when they leave you, you cry and cry;  
Talking about'OMG,OMG i can't find a guy,  
it's been so many years and i've tried and tried,  
why am I even on earth? i should die!'  
You want romeo?,  
you're not worthy.  
You're cock thirsty, nasty and probably got herpes.  
Sometimes the secret to find,  
is to stop searching.  
Try a new formula, Because your last ones not working  
The term real nigga is publically used,  
and I need to know what it means because im fucking confused.  
Are you one? For always busting your two, with nothing to lose and something
to prove, the homies up in your crew.  
Is it because you're selling drugs to get loot?,  
and brag about how you been shot and stabbed like it's fun to be you?  
But your life is a struggle, and you're just hustling through.  
Nah you hamster ass nigga, you just stuck in a LOOP.  
Man, why do black people gotta be the only ones who can't evolve?,  
Because you in the streets acting like neanderthals.  
It's clear that you can't stand the law,  
And all you interested in is fighting,rapping and basketball.  
I can't even fuck with you, because if we out in public,  
he gon' get caught stealing some shit, and get my ass in trouble too.  
You get old and be nothing, living life in these streets,  
thugging and starting shit with anybody mean looking.  
Look at you, a real nigga, thinking you're lifes cool.  
Girls used to turn me down, for guys who were like you.  
‘Till you grabbed their heart and shoved a spear head right through,  
then they regret it because it wasn't the right move.  
You're real nigga talk seems bogus,  
A real nigga don't brag about being real as long as he knows it.  
And his future doesn't seem hopeless,  
A real nigga stays out of jail, handle shit and he keeps focused.  
So all you rappers who soul is out in the wrong, you inspired the issue I
wrote about in this song.  
You go to, who roam around in the slums, this is what happens when rap is
overcrowded with bums.  
Hope the hour is long when I'm rolling out with your tongue  
The man above is my guide, you know my power is strong.  
All you menacing freaks, only in it for cheese and the mass control limit was
breached.  
FUCK HIP-HOP!  
They only in it for cheese, and any eye witness can see.  
They purposley making the innocent weak, my exsistance on this planet's for
you.  
I ain't only here to benifit me, yo we need to make a change while there's
still time.  
It is hard, and at times I struggle trying to reveal mine.  
I can guide you if you feel blind, I just need you to be willing to journey
into my Ill Mind
