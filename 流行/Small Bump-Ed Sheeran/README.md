**Small Bump** 是Ed Sheeran在“+”专辑中的第五波主打歌曲，于2012年6月13日于中国hitfm首播。

这首歌是他从他的一位朋友的经验而写成，这个朋友在孩子五个月大时流产，于是Ed将自己套进故事中，表达他内心的难过。

可以在歌词中看到，他不停地使用You，那种从头到尾全心全意对着一个人，那是一种超脱一切的爱，为人父母，愿牺牲一切去换取孩子的生命，这点也不许质疑。

接下来，仔细听听， _Small Bump_
这首歌刚开始时有一个强烈的节拍打着打着，像是孩子的心跳，而在最后一段，Ed开始使用过去式来对孩子讲话时，那节拍消失了，好似就那一瞬间，他走了。

### Small Bump歌词：

You're just a small bump unborn  
In four months you're brought to life  
You might be left with my hair  
But you'll have your mother's eyes  
I'll hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can  
But for now you're a scan of my unmade plans  
A small bump in four months, you're brought to life  
I'll whisper quietly  
I'll give you nothing but truth  
If you're not inside me  
I'll put my future in you  
You are my one and only  
And you can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight  
Oh, you are my one and only  
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight  
And you'll be alright  
You're just a small bump unknown, you'll grow into your skin  
With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin  
Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice  
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide  
A small bump, in four months you'll open your eyes  
And I'll hold you tightly  
I'll give you nothing but truth  
If you're not inside me  
I'll put my future in you  
You can lie with me  
With your tiny feet  
When you're half asleep  
I'll leave you be  
Right in front of me  
For a couple weeks  
So I can keep you safe  
You were just a small bump unborn  
Just four months then torn from life  
Maybe you were needed up there  
But we're still unaware as why
