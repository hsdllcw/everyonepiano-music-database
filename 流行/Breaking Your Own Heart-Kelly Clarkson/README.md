**Breaking Your Own Heart双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Breaking Your Own Heart_ 收录在美国女歌手Kelly
Clarkson的第五张专辑Stronger中。Kelly表示道：“这次专辑将会是我近年来作品最接近心灵的一次，你知道我要表达的是什么吗？就好似电台司令乐队的另类说唱尽管是非主流，但是它们依然让人产生共鸣。雪儿•克罗也是这样，她是一个非常能够渲染乐迷心灵的歌手，总会创作出一些富有韵律的流行摇滚乐。”

在第55届格莱美奖颁奖典礼上，专辑Stronger获得最佳流行演唱专辑提名，而Kelly本人凭借这一曲也获得最佳流行歌手提名。最终，本专辑赢得第55届格莱美最佳流行演唱专辑大奖。

### Breaking Your Own Heart歌词：

Shaking your head like it's all wrong  
Before you're here you're already gone  
And even with the light all around you  
You're all alone in the dark.  
You're breaking your own heart  
Taking it too far down a lonely road  
You say it's just one love  
But when it's close enough you just let it go  
The very thing you've been the most afraid of  
You've been doing it from the start, breaking your own heart.  
Too many tears, too many falls  
It's easier here behind these walls  
But you don't have to walk in the shadows  
When life is so hard.  
You're breaking your own heart  
Taking it too far down a lonely road  
You say it's just one love  
But when it's close enough you just let it go  
The very thing you've been the most afraid of  
You've been doing it from the start, breaking your own heart.  
You're breaking your own heart.  
It's not too late, I'm still right here.  
If only you let go of your fears.  
You're breaking your heart  
Taking your own heart down a lonely road  
You say it's just one love  
But when it's close enough you just let it go  
The very thing you've been the most afraid of  
You've been doing it from the start, breaking your own heart.  
You're breaking your own heart.
