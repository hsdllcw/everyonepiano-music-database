### Answerphone歌词：

I've been talking to your answerphone na na  
Something tell me you don't want to know na na  
When I call you you don't answer phone na na  
You don't love me you should let me know na na  
Yeah Banx & Ranx  
I got a feeling  
I'm over thinking 'bout thinking you're thinking of leaving  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
But real talk I need some honesty  
Honestly you better speak up  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Days and nights I lie beside my phone  
When you gonna let me know  
When you gonna let me know  
All I hear is please leave your message after the tone  
When you gonna let me know  
I've been talking to your answerphone na na  
Something tell me you don't want to know na na  
When I call you you don't answer phone na na  
You don't love me you should let me know na na  
Let me know na na  
Man down  
Said it was nothing but nothing is all that we have now  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
And now I found out that you got a problem  
A problem you don't wanna talk about  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Days and nights I lie beside my phone  
When you gonna let me know  
When you gonna let me know  
All I hear is please leave your message after the tone  
When you gonna let me know  
I've been talking to your answerphone na na  
Something tell me you don't want to know na na  
When I call you you don't answer phone na na  
You don't love me you should let me know na na  
Let me know na na  
Ringing up my line and that leads me to overthink  
See you in the club last night lead me to overdrink  
Let me fall for you you know I'm on the brink  
Let me know how deep your love goes  
Don't save me let me say  
Days and nights I lie beside my phone  
When you gonna let me know  
When you gonna let me know  
All I hear is please leave your message after the tone  
When you gonna let me know  
I've been talking to your answerphone na na  
Something tell me you don't want to know na na  
When I call you you don't answer phone na na  
You don't love me you should let me know na na  
Let me know na na  
Days and nights I lie beside my phone  
When you gonna let me know  
When you gonna let me know  
All I hear is please leave your message after the tone  
When you gonna let me know  
I've been talking to your answerphone na na
