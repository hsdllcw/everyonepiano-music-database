**Party Favor** 是美国女歌手Billie Eilish演唱的歌曲，收录在其首张EP《Don't Smile at Me》中。

被称作“怪奇少女”的她，出道以来就以特立独行的印象深入人心。她能够对声音的稳定度进行精准的控制，完全使用说话的语感来完成整首歌曲的演唱。这才使得她的声音听上去极为冷漠。当然所有这些要素中最重要的肯定还是Billie
Eilish本身的音色，这种略带沙哑并和气声充分混合的，听似柔软无芯但却具有弹性的声音正是时髦的。这种声线和饱满的电子音乐以及狂躁的舞蹈所形成的融合与反差，正是Billie
Eilish独特魅力的核心。

### Party Favor歌词：

Hey leave a message  
Hey call me back  
When you get this  
Or when you've got a minute  
We really need to talk  
Wait you know what  
Maybe just forget it  
Cause by the time you get this  
Your number might be blocked  
Stay and blah blah blah  
You just want what you can't have  
No wait I'll call the cops  
If you don't stop I'll call your dad  
And I hate to do this to you on your birthday  
Happy birthday by the way  
It's not you it's me and all that other bullshit  
You know that's bullshit  
Don't you babe  
I'm not your party favor  
Look now I know we could've done it better  
But we can't change the weather  
And the weather's come and gone  
Books don't make sense if you read them backwards  
You'll single out the wrong words  
Like you mishear all my songs  
You hear stay and blah blah blah  
You just want what you can't have  
No wait I'll call the cops  
If you don't stop I'll call your dad  
And I hate to do this to you on your birthday  
Happy birthday by the way  
It's not you it's me you and all that other bullshit  
You know that's bullshit  
Don't you babe  
I'm not your party favor
