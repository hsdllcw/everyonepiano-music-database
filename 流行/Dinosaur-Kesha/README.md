### Dinosaur歌词：

[Chorus:]  
D-I-N-O-S-A-U-R a dinosaur  
D-I-N-O-S-A-U-R a dinosaur  
And O-L-D M-A-N  
You're just an old man  
Hitting on me what?  
You need a cat scan

[Verse 1:]  
Old man, why are you starin' at me, mack on me and my friends?  
It's kinda creepy  
You should be prowling around the Old folk's home  
Come on dude!  
Leave us alone

At first we thought that it was kinda ill when  
We saw that you were like a billion  
And still out tryin' to make a killin'  
Get back to the museum

[Chorus:]  
D-I-N-O-S-A-U-R a dinosaur  
D-I-N-O-S-A-U-R a dinosaur  
And O-L-D M-A-N  
You're just an old man  
Hitting on me what?  
You need a cat scan

Hey dinosaur, baby you're pre-historic  
Hey dinosaur, that's what you are, ha  
Hey carnivore, you want my meat I know it  
Hey dinosaur, that's what you are, ha

Yeah, you're pretty old

[Verse 2:]  
Not long 'til you're a senior citizen  
And you can strut around with that sexy tank of oxygen  
Honey your toupee is fallin' to your left side  
Get up and go bro!  
Oh wait you're fossilized, ha!

And you sit down, buy me a martini  
Won't go away my hips aren't sinking  
"Hey," you say, "Wanna come with me?"  
I'm about to barf seriously

[Chorus:]  
D-I-N-O-S-A-U-R a dinosaur  
D-I-N-O-S-A-U-R a dinosaur  
And O-L-D M-A-N  
You're just an old man  
Hitting on me what?  
You need a cat scan

Hey dinosaur, baby, you're prehistoric  
Hey dinosaur, that's what you are ha!  
Hey carnivore, you want my meat, I know it  
Hey dinosaur, that's what you are ha!

Hey dinosaur, baby, you're prehistoric  
Hey dinosaur, that's what you are ha!  
Hey carnivore, you want my meat, I know it  
Hey dinosaur, that's what you are ha!

D-I-N-O-S-A-U-R a dinosaur  
D-I-N-O-S-A  
That's what you are ha!  
D-I-N-O-S-A-U-R a dinosaur  
D-I-N-O-S-A  
That's what you are ha!
