Really Don't Care歌词：

You wanna play, you wanna stay  
you wanna have it all,  
You started messing with my head  
until I hit a wall,  
Maybe I should've known,  
maybe I should've known  
That you would walk, you would walk,  
out the door, hey!  
Said we were done and  
met someone and rubbed it in my face,  
Cut to the part, she broke your heart  
and then she ran away,  
I guess you should've known,  
I guess you should've known,  
That I would talk, I would talk  
But even if the stars and moon collide,  
I never want you back into my life,  
You can take your words and all your lies,  
Oh, oh oh! I really don't care!  
Even if the stars and moon collide,  
I never want you back into my life,  
You can take your words and all your lies,  
Oh, oh oh! I really don't care!  
Oh, oh, oh! I really don't care!  
I can't believe I ever stayed up  
writing songs about you,  
You don't deserve to know the way  
I used to think about you,  
Oh no not anymore, oh no not anymore,  
You had your shot, had your shot, but you let go!  
Now if we meet out on the street  
I won't be running scared,  
I'll walk right up to you  
and put one finger in the air,  
And make you understand,  
and make you understand,  
You had your chance, had your chance!  
But even if the stars and moon collide,  
I never want you back into my life,  
You can take your words and all your lies,  
Oh, oh oh! I really don't care!  
Even if the stars and moon collide,  
I never want you back into my life,  
You can take your words and all your lies,  
Oh, oh oh! I really don't care!  
Oh, oh, oh! I really don't care!  
Yeah, listen up!  
Hey, hey, never look back,  
Dumbstruck boy, ego intact,  
Look boy, why you so mad,  
Second guess him but should hit that,  
Hey demi, you picked the wrong lova',  
You should've picked that one,  
he's cuter than the other,  
I just wanna laugh 'cause  
you're trying to be a hipster,  
Kick 'em to the curb, take a Polaroid picture!  
But even if the stars and moon collide,  
I never want you back into my life,  
You can take your words and all your lies,  
Oh, oh oh! I really don't care!  
Even if the stars and moon collide,  
I never want you back into my life,  
You can take your words and all your lies,  
Oh, oh oh! I really don't care!  
Oh, oh oh! I really don't care!

  
  
  
  
  

你总是玩弄感情

又想保留这份爱情

你什么都想要

你让我心烦意乱直到我一头撞到墙上

可能我早该知道

可能我早该知道

你会离开我

你会离开我

头也不回甩上门，嘿！

我们刚分手，你就勾搭上别人

还当着我的面儿秀甜蜜

后来的故事就是

她伤透了你的心

结果她就跑掉了

我猜你早该知道

我猜你早该知道

我会嘲讽你

我会嘲讽你

即使星星撞月亮

你也别再出现在我眼前

不管你说过什么，骗过谁

哦哦哦，我真的不在乎

即使星星撞月亮

你也别再出现在我眼前

不管你说过什么，骗过谁

哦哦哦，我真的不在乎

哦哦哦，我真的不在乎

想不到自己原来竟然会为你熬夜写歌

你根本没资格知道我以前对你的感觉

哦，不会，你再也不会知道了

哦，不会，你再也不会知道了

谁让你不珍惜我

谁让你不珍惜我

怪谁啊

要是现在我们在街上碰见，我才不会被你吓跑

我会竖起一根手指冲着你走过去

我就是要让你明白

我就是要让你明白

你已经没机会了

你已经没机会了

即使星星撞月亮

你也别再出现在我眼前

不管你说过什么，骗过谁

哦哦哦，我真的不在乎

即使星星撞月亮

你也别再出现在我眼前

不管你说过什么，骗过谁

哦哦哦，我真的不在乎

哦哦哦，我真的不在乎

Yeah,听好了！

嘿，嘿，别再回头

瞠目结舌的男孩，总是自以为是

你看你，怎么那么生气？

我猜猜，是受打击了吧？

嘿，Demi，你挑错人了

那边那个人好，比他帅多了

笑死我了

因为你卖萌装文艺

把他踢到一边儿

还要照张相！

即使星星撞月亮

你也别再出现在我眼前

不管你说过什么，骗过谁

哦哦哦，我真的不在乎

即使星星撞月亮

你也别再出现在我眼前

不管你说过什么，骗过谁

哦哦哦，我真的不在乎

哦哦哦，我真的不在乎
