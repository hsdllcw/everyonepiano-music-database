### You Should Be Sad歌词：

I wanna start this out and say  
I gotta get it off my chest  
Got no anger got no malice  
Just a little bit of regret  
Know nobody else will tell you  
So there's some things I gotta say  
Gonna jot it down and then get it out  
And then I'll be on my way  
No you're not half the man you think that you are  
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money d**gs and cars  
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you  
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you  
Oh I feel so sorry I feel so sad  
I tried to help you it just made you mad  
And I had no warning about who you are  
I'm just glad I made it out without breaking down  
And then ran so f**king far  
That you would never ever touch me again  
Won't see your alligator tears  
'Cause no I've had enough of them  
Let me start this off by saying  
I really meant well from the start  
Take a broken man right in my hands  
And then put back all his parts  
But you're not half the man you think that you are  
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money girls and cars  
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you  
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you  
Oh I feel so sorry  
I feel so sorry  
I feel so sad  
I feel so sad  
I tried to help you  
I tried to help you  
It just made you mad  
And I had no warning  
I had no warning  
About who you are  
About who you are  
I'm just glad I made it out without breaking down  
Oh I feel so sorry  
I feel so sorry  
I feel so sad  
I feel so sad  
I tried to help you  
I tried to help you  
It just made you mad  
And I had no warning  
I had no warning  
About who you are  
About who you are  
About who you are  
Hey  
Hey  
Hey  
Hey  
'Cause you're not half the man you think that you are  
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money d**gs and cars  
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you  
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you  
I feel so sad  
You should be sad  
You should be  
You should be sad  
You should be  
You should be  
You should be
