### I'll Be There歌词：

When all the tears are rolling down your face  
And it feels like yours was the only heart to break  
When you come back home and all the lights are out ooh  
And you getting used to no one else being around  
Oh oh I'll be there  
When you need a little love I got a little love to share  
Yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna come through  
You'll never be alone I'll be there for you  
I'll be there I'll be there for you  
I'll be there I'll be there for you  
Oh I swear I got enough love for two ooh ooh ooh  
You'll never be alone I'll be there for you  
When it's Friday night and the drink don't work the same  
You're alone with yourself and there's no one else to blame  
When you still can't feel the rhythm of your heart  
And you see your spirit fading in the dark  
Oh oh I'll be there  
When you need a little love I got a little love to share  
Yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna come through  
You'll never be alone I'll be there for you  
I'll be there I'll be there for you  
I'll be there I'll be there for you  
Oh I swear I got enough love for two ooh ooh ooh  
You'll never be alone I'll be there for you  
When you're lost down the river bed I'll be there  
When you're lost in the darkness I'll be there  
I'll be there when you're heart is breaking  
You'll never be alone I'll be there for you  
I'll be there  
I'll be there I'll be there for you I'll be there  
I'll be there I'll be there for you ooh ooh I'll be there  
Oh I swear I got enough love for two ooh ooh ooh  
You'll never be alone I'll be there for you oh  
I'll be there I'll be there for you  
I'll be there I'll be there for you  
Oh I swear I got enough love for two ooh ooh ooh  
You'll never be alone I'll be there for you ooh  
I'll be there for you ooh  
I'll be there for you ooh  
You'll never be alone I'll be there for you  
I'll be there for you ooh  
I'll be there for you ooh  
You'll never be alone I'll be there for you
