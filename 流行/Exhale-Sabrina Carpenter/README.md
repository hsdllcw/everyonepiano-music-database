### Exhale歌词：

Who put the baby in charge  
It's already hard to buy all the parts and learn to use them  
Who put the world on my back and not in my hands  
Just give me a chance  
I listen to my mama  
Listen to my dad  
Listen to my sisters  
Everyone relax  
Everybody answers s**t I didn't ask  
Think I'm reaching my limit  
Can I exhale for a minute  
Can I get this out in the open  
Can I sit down for a second  
Can I breathe  
Can I exhale for a minute  
Can we talk it out I don't get it  
Can I calm down for a moment  
Can I breathe for just one second  
I put too much weight on words and glances  
I I put too much weight on situations  
I I put too much on myself thinking "I don't deserve what I've earned"  
But yeah  
I listen to the labels listen to the man  
Try to keep a sense of knowing who I am  
I try to be an angel but I don't think I can  
Think I'm reaching my limits yeah  
Can I exhale for a minute  
Can I get this out in the open  
Can I sit down for a second  
Can I breathe  
Can I exhale for a minute  
Can we talk it out I don't get it  
Can I calm down for a moment  
Can I breathe for just one second baby  
Can I breathe  
Can I breathe  
Can I breathe  
Can I breathe  
Can I breathe  
Can I breathe  
Can I breathe  
Na na na na na na nay  
Na na na na na na nay  
Na na na na na na nay  
Na na na na na na nay
