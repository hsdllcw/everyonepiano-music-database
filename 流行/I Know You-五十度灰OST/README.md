### I Know You歌词：

I believe, I believe there's love in you  
Grid locked on the dusty avenues  
Inside your heart, just afraid to go  
I am more, I am more than innocent  
But just take a chance and let me in  
And I'll show you ways that you don't know

Don't complicate it,  
Don't let the past dictate  
Yeah,  
I have been patient, but slowly I'm losing faith

So please, I know you baby  
I know you baby  
So please, I know you baby  
I know you baby

I believe, I believe you could love me  
But you're lost on the road to misery  
And what I gave to you  
I could never get back!  
Don't complicate it,  
Don't drive yourself insane  
Yeah,  
Say what you will but I know that you want to stay!

So please, I know you baby  
I know you baby  
So please, I know you baby  
I know you baby

Chemicals rushing in,  
I know it's you that I belong to  
I'm burning like a cannonball in the air  
Crashing into who I belong to  
Uh uh, uuuuh uuuuh uh

I have been patient, but slowly I'm losing faith

Please, I know you baby  
I know you baby  
So please, I know you baby  
I know you baby

So please, I know you baby  
(The shadows of your heart are hanging in the sweet, sweet air)  
I know you baby  
(I know you baby)  
So please, I know you baby  
(The secrets that you hide, control us and it's just not fair)  
I know you baby

The shadows of your heart are hanging in the sweet, sweet air  
I know you baby  
The secrets that you hide, control us and it's just not fair  
I know you baby
