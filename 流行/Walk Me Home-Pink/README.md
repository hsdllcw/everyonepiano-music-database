### Walk Me Home歌词：

There's something in the way you roll your eyes  
Takes me back to a better time  
When I saw everything is good  
But now you're the only thing that's good  
Trying to stand up on my own two feet  
This conversation ain't coming easily  
And darling I know it's getting late  
So what do you say we leave this place  
Walk me home in the dead of night  
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind mhm  
So say you'll stay with me tonight  
Cause there is so much wrong going on outside  
There's something in the way I wanna cry  
That makes me think we'll make it out alive  
So come on and show me how we're good  
I think that we could do some good mhm  
Walk me home in the dead of night  
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind mhm  
So say you'll stay with me tonight  
'Cause there is so much wrong going on outside  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Walk me home in the dead of night  
'Cause I can't be alone with all that's on my mind  
Say you'll stay with me tonight  
'Cause there is so much wrong going on  
Walk me home in the dead of night  
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind  
So say you'll stay with me tonight  
'Cause there is so much wrong  
There is so much wrong  
There is so much wrong going on outside
