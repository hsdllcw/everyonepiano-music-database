### Only Love Can Hurt Like This歌词：

I'd tell myself you don't mean a thing,  
But what we got, got no hold on me  
But when you're not there I just crumble  
I tell myself I don't care that much,  
But I feel like I die 'til I feel your touch,

Only love, only love can hurt like this,  
Only love can hurt like this  
Must have been a deadly kiss  
Only love can hurt like this

Say I wouldn't care if you walked away,  
But every time you're there I'm begging you to stay,  
When you come close I just tremble  
And every time, every time you go,  
It's like a knife that cuts right through my soul

Only love, only love can hurt like this  
Only love can hurt like this,  
Must have been a deadly kiss,  
Only love can hurt like this,  
Only love can hurt like this

Your kisses burn into my skin,  
Only love can hurt like this  
But it's the sweetest pain,  
Burning hot through my veins,  
Love is torture makes me more sure

Only love can hurt like this,  
Only love can hurt like this,  
Must have been the deadly kiss,  
Only love can hurt like this,

Only love can hurt like this,  
Your kisses burn into my skin,  
Only love can hurt like this,  
Only love can hurt like this,  
Save me, save me,  
Only love, only love,  
'Cause only love can hurt like this  
And it must have been the deadly kiss
