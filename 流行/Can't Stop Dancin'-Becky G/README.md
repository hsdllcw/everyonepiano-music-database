### Can't Stop Dancin'歌词：

The lights are shining like the sun out tonight  
Just keep your body moving how I like  
Oh, yeah the music feels like paradise  
Can't get any better, no

I wanna stay right in this moment for life  
Baby, treat me wrong, treat me right

Ay ay ay, aye  
Just can't stop dancing  
Ay ay ay, aye  
Don't wanna chance it  
So don't let go, let go of me  
Don't let go, let go of me  
Ay ay ay, aye  
I just can't stop dancing

Again now  
Spin around now  
Down now,  
To the floor now

Your mind is going places I can feel  
That further let's me know this is real  
And I won't stop you no I like it there  
You can even go further, babe

'Cause nothing's forbidden  
Don't be scared, no worries  
Once I'm there, all is forgiven  
So be prepared  
To come and push up on my...

Ay ay ay, aye  
Just can't stop dancing  
Ay ay ay, aye  
Don't wanna chance it  
So don't let go, let go of me  
Don't let go, let go of me  
Ay ay ay, aye  
I just can't stop dancing

Again now  
Spin around now  
Down now,  
To the floor now

Believe it, I feel it  
It's in the air  
Although you can't see it you know it's there  
My heart keeps on racing, in overdrive  
Once the music hits my body I feel so alive  
And it's alright  
It's got me like...

Ay ay ay, aye  
Just can't stop dancing  
Ay ay ay, aye  
Don't wanna chance it  
So don't let go, let go of me  
Don't let go, let go of me  
Ay ay ay, aye  
I just can't stop dancing

Ay ay ay, aye  
Just can't stop dancing  
Ay ay ay, aye  
I Don't wanna chance it  
So don't let go, let go of me  
Don't let go, let go of me  
Ay ay ay, aye  
I just can't stop dancing
