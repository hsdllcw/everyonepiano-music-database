**Bye Bye Bye** 是美国乐队'N Sync所演唱的歌曲。

  
在第三张专辑No Strings Attached发售后不久，Nsync便创造了一个新的流行音乐记录。专辑中的第一首单曲 _bye bye bye_
是一首Urban味十足且富有他们恰倒好处的和声的快节奏歌曲,同时这也成为了热门当代单曲电台的有史以来播放率最高的单曲。舞蹈老师Darrin
Henson为这首歌想出了一个标志性的舞蹈动作：这个用一只手模仿一个一张一合的嘴巴的动作象征着对这个组合拒绝者的一种打击,而一个甩动的拳头则体现出他们的力量！2000年3月21日，在成功推出单曲“Bye
Bye Bye”后，这张专辑正式发行，发行首日便卖出超过100万张，一周后卖出超过240万张，均打破了唱片史发行首日和首周的销售记录。专辑中从"Bye
Bye Bye" "It's Gonna Be Me"等快歌到 "This I Promise
You"这样的抒情慢歌都体现了*NSYNC的成长。JC在专辑的四首歌曲中参与了创作，显示了他创作上的才华。"Bye Bye
Bye"在当年的格莱美中获得了“年度最佳单曲”的提名。随后"No Strings Attached" 巡演和唱片一样大获成功，在各地都有很好的票房。

### Bye Bye Bye歌词：

Bye bye bye  
I'm doing this tonight  
You're probably gonna start a fight  
I know this can't be right  
Hey baby come on  
I loved you endlessly  
When you weren't there for me  
So now it's time to leave and make it alone

I know that I can't take no more  
It ain't no lie  
I want to see you out that door  
Baby bye bye bye

[Chorus]  
Bye bye Don't want to be a fool for you  
Just another player in your game for two  
You may hate me but it ain't no lie  
Baby bye bye bye  
Bye bye  
Don't want to make it tough  
I just want to tell you that I've had enough  
It might sound crazy but it ain't no lie  
Baby bye bye bye

You just hit me with the truth  
Now girl you're more than welcome to  
So give me one good reason  
Baby come on  
I've lived for you and me  
And now I really come to see  
That life would be much better once you're gone

I know that I can't take no more  
Ain't no lie  
I want to see you out that door  
Baby bye bye bye

[Chorus]

I'm givng up I know for sure  
don't' want to be the reason for your love no more  
Bye bye  
I'm checking out, I'm signing off  
Don't want to be the loser and I've had enough

I don't want to be your fool in this game for two  
So I'm leaving you behind  
(Bye bye bye)  
I don't want to make it tough  
(Make it tough)  
But I've had enough  
(Bye bye)  
And it ain't no lie

[Chorus]
