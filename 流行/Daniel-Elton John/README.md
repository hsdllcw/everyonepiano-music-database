### Daniel歌词：

Daniel is travelling tonight on a plane  
I can see the red tail lights heading for Spain  
Oh and I can see Daniel waving goodbye  
God it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes

They say Spain is pretty though I've never been  
Well Daniel says it's the best place that he's ever seen  
Oh and he should know, he's been there enough  
Lord I miss Daniel, oh I miss him so much

Daniel my brother you are older than me  
Do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal  
Your eyes have died but you see more than I  
Daniel you're a star in the face of the sky

Daniel is travelling tonight on a plane  
I can see the red tail lights heading for Spain  
Oh and I can see Daniel waving goodbye  
God it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes  
Oh God it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes
