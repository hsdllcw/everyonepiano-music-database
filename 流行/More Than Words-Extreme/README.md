**More Than Words** 是Extreme1990年发行的专辑《Pornograffitti》中的一首歌。

  
Extreme 成立于己于1986年，阵容是 Nuno Bettencourt, Gray Cherone（vocals）, Patrick Badger
(bass), Paul Geary
(drums)。乐队于1989年推出了首张同名专辑。当时的乐迷们似乎更愿意看到他们心中的偶像在电视中口吐脏话，在舞台上叼着烟大摔吉他之类傲慢不驯的举止，而乐队的小伙子们则显得过于健康文静，缺少花哨的包装与花边新闻，这也使
MTV
等娱乐业的宣传机器忽视了他们极高的音乐水准与严肃的立意。我行我素的乐队成员们坚持着自己的风格并没有向媚俗的音乐传媒和乐迷们屈服，于1990年推出极为经典之作——《Pornograffitti》。

  
Westlife也曾翻唱过这首 _More Than Words_ 。

### More Than Words歌词：

Saying I love you  
Is not the words I want to hear from you  
It's not that I want you  
Not to say, but if you only knew  
How easy it would be to show me how you feel  
More than words is all you have to do to make it real  
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me  
Cos I'd already know

What would you do if my heart was torn in two  
More than words to show you feel  
That your love for me is real  
What would you say if I took those words away  
Then you couldn't make things new  
Just by saying I love you

More than words

Now I've tried to talk to you and make you understand  
All you have to do is close your eyes  
And just reach out your hands and touch me  
Hold me close don't ever let me go  
More than words is all I ever needed you to show  
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me  
Cos I'd already know

What would you do if my heart was torn in two  
More than words to show you feel  
That your love for me is real  
What would you say if I took those words away  
Then you couldn't make things new  
Just by saying I love you

More than words
