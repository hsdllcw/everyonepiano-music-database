### Not Another Love Song歌词：

I don't wanna mess this up  
Could it be too much to say I'm in  
Deep end swimming in my feelings  
I been here before but it feels like I'm drowning  
Sinking in my overthinking  
Tell me am I foolish to think you'd meet me here  
I wanna do this again  
I'm going down  
'Cause I know that it's you  
I see in my dreams  
I'm going down  
Let me drown over you  
Living in my dream  
In my dreams  
I love the way you do it  
Don't stop don't wanna lose it  
I love the way you do it to me  
I love the way you do it  
Don't stop don't wanna lose it  
I love the way you do it to me  
But  
I don't wanna mess this up  
Could it be too much to say I'm in  
I just wanna know wassup  
Do you feel it  
'Cause I think I'm in  
Love  
Love  
I'm finna take my time  
My mind my rules  
This ain't no crime  
Making love to you  
Though you ain't said it's mine  
I have a hard time waiting for you babe  
Like ooh boy  
You boy  
Got me where you want  
Just gotta say and it's on  
It's like ooh boy  
Do you know you got me like  
Where do you go when you're alone  
I wanna do this again  
I'm going down  
'Cause I know that it's you  
I see in my dreams  
I'm going down  
Let me drown over you  
Living in my dream  
In my dreams  
I love the way you do it  
Don't stop don't wanna lose it  
I love the way you do it to me  
I love it  
I love the way you do it  
Don't stop don't wanna lose it  
I love the way you do it to me  
But  
I don't wanna mess this up  
Could it be too much to say I'm in  
I just wanna know wassup  
Do you feel it  
'Cause I think I'm in love  
Love  
I guess it's all in my head  
Until you let my body know  
'Cause everyone ain't you babe  
Want nobody but you babe  
So tell me whatcha gon' do babe  
Not another love song
