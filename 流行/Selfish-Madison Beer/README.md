### Selfish歌词：

Boy you're such a lost cause  
Now your name is crossed off  
How you gonna fix this  
You can't even fix yourself  
It was almost two years  
That I chose to spend here  
All alone on New Year's  
Thinkin' "What the Hell"  
I don't wanna break your thread  
A needle tryna stitch you  
But I can't I refuse  
Shouldn't love you but I couldn't help it  
Had a feeling that you never felt it  
I always knew that you were too d**n selfish  
Don't know why I looked the other way  
I wanted you to change yeah  
I shouldn't love you but I couldn't help it  
I always knew that you were too d**n selfish  
I bet you thought you gave me real love  
But we spent it all in nightclubs  
All you ever wanna do is lie  
Why you always such a Gemini  
Baby who you tryna run from  
Me or all your problems  
You know you will never solve 'em  
You don't even know yourself  
I don't wanna break your thread  
A needle tryna stitch you  
But I can't I refuse  
Shouldn't love you but I couldn't help it  
Had a feeling that you never felt it  
I always knew that you were too d**n selfish  
Don't know why I looked the other way  
I wanted you to change yeah  
I shouldn't love you  
But I couldn't help it  
I always knew that you were too d**n selfish  
I don't wanna break your thread and needle  
Tryna stitch you but I can't I refuse  
But it's not possible  
Plus I'm not responsible  
For your self-made obstacles  
Put my heart in the hospital  
Woah woah oh  
Shouldn't love you but I couldn't help it  
Had a feeling that you never felt it  
I always knew that you were too d**n selfish  
Don't know why I looked the other way  
I wanted you to change yeah  
I shouldn't love you  
But I couldn't help it  
I always knew that you were too d**n selfish  
Oh oh mm
