### Learn To Let Go歌词：

Been a prisoner of the past  
Had a bitterness when I looked back  
Was telling everyone it's not that bad  
'Til all my shit hit the fan  
I know I'm always like  
Telling everybody you don't gotta be a victim  
Life ain't always fair but hell is living in resentment  
Choose redemption your happy ending's up to you  
I think it's time to practice what I preach  
Exorcise the demons inside me  
Whoa gotta learn to let it go  
The past can't haunt me if I don't let it  
Live and learn and never forget it  
Whoa gotta learn to let it go  
Had a boogieman under my bed  
Putting crazy thoughts inside my head  
Always whispering it's all your fault  
He was telling me no you're not that strong  
I know I'm always like  
Telling everybody you don't have to be a victim  
Life ain't always fair but hell is living in resentment  
Choose redemption your happy ending's up to you  
So I think it's time to practice what I preach  
Exorcise the demons inside me  
Whoa gotta learn to let it go  
The past can't haunt me if I don't let it  
Live and learn and never forget it  
Whoa gotta learn to let it go  
Hey eh eh eh yeah  
Hey eh eh eh yeah  
Learn to let go learn to let go  
Hey eh eh eh yeah  
Hey eh eh eh yeah  
Learn to let go learn to let go  
I'm done reliving my bad decisions  
I see now maybe there's a reason  
Why I I I I I I been through hell and back  
Yeah honestly it's what made me who I am  
Holding on to wasted time  
Gotta learn to let go in life  
So I think it's time to practice what I preach  
Exorcise the demons inside me  
Whoa gotta learn to let it go  
The past can't haunt me if I don't let it  
Live and learn and never forget it  
Whoa gotta learn to let it go  
Hey eh eh eh yeah  
Hey eh eh eh yeah  
Learn to let go learn to let go  
Hey eh eh eh yeah  
Hey eh eh eh yeah  
Learn to let go learn to let go
