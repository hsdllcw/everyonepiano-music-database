### All Your Exes歌词：

Hmm-mmh  
I know where you've been what you've done  
Who you loved it's a part of who you are  
But the maturity ship sails when I hold you in my arms  
There's a spot on your chest just for me  
It's personally addressed  
And anyone there before me  
Should be a criminal offense  
When your friends tell stories about 2017  
I know there's parts that they leave out  
To be considerate of me  
Wish I could be blissfully unaware  
Of where you used to put your mouth  
And who you write your f**king songs about  
I wanna live in a world where all your exes are dead  
I wanna kill all the memories that you saved in your head  
Be the only girl that's ever been in your bed  
I wanna live in a world where all your exes are dead  
I wanna live in a world where there's no exes at all  
Like you were waiting for me to be the first thing you fall for  
The only girl that's ever been in your bed  
I wanna live in a world where all your exes are dead  
Please don't tell me if I accidentally stumble  
Into something that reminds you of her  
No I don't need your previous statistics  
Where you spent your last Christmas  
Spare your past-life specifics  
Oh and when your friends tell stories about 2023  
I hope they hardly can recall there was a you without a me  
Wish I could be blissfully unaware  
Of the history on your couch  
And who your songs all used to be about  
I wanna live in a world where all your exes are dead  
I wanna kill all the memories that you saved in your head  
Be the only girl that's ever been in your bed  
I wanna live in a world where all your exes are dead  
I wanna live in a world where there's no exes at all  
Like you were waiting for me to be the first thing you fall for  
The only girl that's ever been in your bed  
I wanna live in a world where all your exes are dead  
Don't tell me to make nice  
That I should try to empathize  
I'm confident I've got them accurately demonized  
You tell me not to worry I'm the only thing you see  
Well yeah I f**king better be  
I wanna live in a world where all your exes are dead  
I wanna kill all the memories that you saved in your head  
Be the only girl that's ever been in your bed  
I wanna live in a world where all your exes are dead  
I wanna live in a world where there's no exes at all  
Like you were waiting for me to be the first thing you fall for  
The only girl that's ever been in your bed  
I wanna live in a world where all your exes are dead
