### Would You Ever歌词：

Would you ever run away with me?  
你可想远走高飞同我  
Would you ever take a chance with me?  
你可敢将自己交付我  
Would you ever take a leap with me?  
你可愿刀山火海伴我  
Would you ever change the frequency?  
你可知你改变不止我  
Would you ever?  
你想吗?  
Would you ever?  
你敢吗?  
Would you ever?  
你愿意吗?

你可愿刀山火海伴我  
Would you ever change the frequency?  
你可知你改变不止我  
Would you ever hope for a never ending?  
你望爱恋保质期永远  
Would you ever hope for a new beginning?  
你望重新拥抱这世界
