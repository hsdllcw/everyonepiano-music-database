**Do It** 是美国新晋R&B灵魂流行姐妹花组合Chloe x Halle的歌曲，收录在其第二张录音室专辑Ungodly Hour中。

作为Beyoncé旗下前景突出的实力新秀，Chloe x
Halle显然拥有让人过目不忘的洗练双重才气。早期曾以童星身份客串出现在多部电影中的姐妹俩，在后来选择以改编翻唱循序渐进起家，凭借出色演绎和运气机遇得到了签约碧姐公司的机会，无论是EP、Mixtape以及单曲性质的原创作品呈现，还是大小巡回演出中流露出对核心情感的巧妙极致把控张力，Chloe
x Halle都极力印证了新时代二重唱形态下那充满高辨识度的瞭望心魂特征。

### Do It歌词：

Yeah I beat my face  
Moving fast cause the Uber on the way  
Taking pictures make sure you can't see no lace  
That wig secure like the money in the safe  
I look like bae  
Now I'm on my way  
Let you know when I'm 'bout a mile away  
When I'm outside please don't make me wait  
The party starting when we pull up to the gate we so late  
I'm just with the crew  
We ain't out here looking for boo  
'Cause some nights be better with you  
It's a homies only kind of mood  
And tonight we on a hundred  
One hundred  
No drama  
No baby mamas  
Keeping it cute  
Oh oh oh  
That's just what I do do do  
And that's just how we do it do it do it  
Yeah that's just how we do it do it do it  
You liking what I do do you  
Know how to keep it cool  
And that's just how we do it  
Yeah that's just how we do it  
And you could do it too too too oh  
No complaints  
Left the heels at home I'm on my sneaker game  
He say where you from  
Tell 'em outer space  
'Cause a bag the only thing I'm tryna chase  
I'm M.I.A  
Just tell the DJ  
Press play rewind  
Keep it on repeat  
Tiptoe round a hater I'm light on my feet  
That's how you do it  
Keep stunting on your enemies  
Good vibes only  
I'm just with the crew  
We ain't looking for a boo  
'Cause some nights be better with you  
It's a homies only kind of mood  
And tonight we on a hundred  
One hundred  
No drama  
No baby mamas  
Keeping it cute  
Oh oh oh  
That's just what I do do do  
And that's just how we do it do it do it  
Yeah that's just how we do it do it do it  
You liking what I do do you  
Know how to keep it cool  
And that's just how we do it  
Yeah that's just how we do it  
And you could do it too too too oh  
Oh oh oh  
That's just what I do do do  
And that's just how we do it do it do it  
Yeah that's just how we do it do it do it  
You liking what I do do you  
Know how to keep it cool  
And that's just how we do it  
Yeah that's just how we do it  
And you could do it too too too  
Yeah that's just how we do it
