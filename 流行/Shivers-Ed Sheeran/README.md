Ed Sheeran新单《 **Shivers** 》发行，官方MV同天上线，收录在其第四张录音室专辑《=》中，且专辑将于10月29日全球发行。

《 _Shivers_ 》从作曲到完成制作只花了3天时间。此曲又回到了《[ **Bad Habits**](Music-13251-Bad-Habits-
Ed-Sheeran.html "Bad
Habits")》那种充满节奏韵律的曲风。虽不似以前的纯粹深情演绎，但动感节奏风格的转变也是一种大胆尝试，怪诞的同时还夹杂着一丝诙谐，相当抓耳。

歌词下方是 _Shivers钢琴谱_ ，大家可以免费下载学习。

### Shivers歌词：

I took an arrow to the heart  
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours  
Strawberries and then something more  
Oh yeah I want it all  
Lipstick on my guitar  
Fill up the engine we can drive real far  
Go dancing underneath the stars  
Oh yeah I want it all  
You got me feeling like  
I wanna be that guy  
I wanna kiss your eyes  
I wanna drink that smile  
I wanna feel like I  
Like my souls on fire  
I wanna stay up all day and all night  
Yeah you got me singing like  
Ooh I love it when you do it like that  
And when you're close up  
Give me the shivers  
Oh baby you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks  
And when they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back  
And we'll say  
Ooh I love it when you do it like that  
And when you're close up  
Give me the shivers  
Oh baby you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks  
And when they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back  
Into the car  
On the backseat in the moonlit dark  
Wrap me up between your legs and arms  
Oh I can't get enough  
You know you could tear me apart  
Put me back together and take my heart  
I never thought that I could love this hard  
Oh I can't get enough  
You got me feeling like  
I wanna be that guy  
I wanna kiss your eyes  
I wanna drink that smile  
I wanna feel like I  
Like my souls on fire  
I wanna stay up all day and all night  
Yeah you got me singing like  
Ooh I love it when you do it like that  
And when you're close up  
Give me the shivers  
Oh baby you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks  
And when they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back  
And we'll say ooh I love it when you do it like that  
And when you're close up  
Give me the shivers  
Oh baby you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks  
And when they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back  
Baby you burn so hot  
You make me shiver with the fire you got  
This thing we started I don't want it to stop you know you make me shiver  
Baby you burn so hot  
You make me shiver with the fire you got  
This thing we started I don't want it to stop you know you make me shiver  
Yeah you got me singing like  
Ooh I love it when you do it like that  
And when you're close up  
Give me the shivers  
Oh baby you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks  
And when they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back  
Ooh I love it when you do it like that  
And when you're close up  
Give me the shivers  
Oh baby you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks  
And when they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back
