### Save Yourself歌词：

Save yourself  
Love is pain I know too well  
You've never felt waves this strong  
Just save yourself  
I learned to sink or swim but you can't even dive right in  
Save yourself  
If you're drowning in your doubt  
Save yourself  
I'm caught up in a current babe  
Heartbreak games you won't play  
It's obvious you don't need me  
That's okay drift away  
I will trust my fate  
You live your truth  
I will get over it  
It's obvious you don't need me  
That's okay drift away  
Save yourself  
Love is pain I know too well  
You've never felt waves this strong  
Just save yourself  
I learned to sink or swim but you can't even dive right in  
Save yourself  
If you're drowning in your doubt  
Save yourself  
You're running from a hurricane  
I set fire to the rain  
I wanna be your lifeline babe  
I've got time and you got brave  
I will trust my fate  
You live your truth  
I will get over it  
It's obvious you don't need me no  
Can you hear me  
Can you hear me  
Can you hear me  
Save yourself  
Love is pain I know too well  
You've never felt waves this strong  
Just save yourself  
I learned to sink or swim but you can't even dive right in  
Save yourself  
If you're drowning in your doubt  
Save yourself  
If you're drowning in your doubt  
Just save yourself  
Save yourself  
Love is pain I know too well  
You've never felt waves this strong  
Just save yourself  
I learned to sink or swim but you can't even dive right in  
Save yourself  
If you're drowning in your doubt  
Save yourself
