**24** 是美国流行女歌手Lana Del
Rey的歌曲，收录在其专辑Honeymoon中。整张专辑中的14首歌曲，犹如组成的一部爱情长诗，其中的内容就好像一个痴恋女子说服爱人，一同逃离现状去度“蜜月”的故事。拉娜•德雷标志性的低音复古唱腔：慵懒、空灵、凄迷、哀艳、幽怨、怅惘的气息愈发令人着迷。这一切都让人欣喜，这一次，拉娜•德雷向乐迷展现的是一个更本色的“自我”形象。

另外，《 _24_ 》在内容上颇像专辑的开场曲，从结构上照应，则更像是一次重温旧梦。

### 24歌词：

There's only 24 hours in a day  
And half as many ways for you to lie to me, my little love  
There's only 24 hours in a day  
And half of those, you lay awake  
With thoughts of murder and carnage

If you lie down with dogs, then you'll get fleas  
Be careful of the company you keep

There's only 24 hours  
And that's not enough  
To lie like you lie or  
Love like you love

There's only 24 hours in a day  
And half of those you lay  
Between the sheets with me, my lying love  
There's only 24 hours, so you'd say  
For most of them you pay  
For all the things they paid you for, my love

If you lie down with dogs, then you'll get fleas  
Be careful of the ones you choose to leave

There's only 24 hours  
And that's not enough  
To lie like you lie or  
Love like you love

Give me your heat  
Give me your diamonds  
You hit that street  
And my crooked lust  
You count to three  
While they're all dying  
You're hard to reach  
You're cold to touch
