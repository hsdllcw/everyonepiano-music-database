### Deliver歌词：

He know I keep it ready on the regular  
So I don't have to get ready ain't no setting up  
When I give it I make sure I give more than enough yeah  
He knows he knows this  
He know he knows this  
No needs for replacements or a warrantee  
And he'll never need another that's a guarantee  
I can overnight this body if it's what you need yeah  
He know he knows this  
He know he knows this  
Never hit or miss he know I always come through  
Show up looking like my photo keep it foolproof  
When you call me know you know just what I'm gon' do gon' do  
Yeah my baby knows that I deliver  
That's exactly what I'm gon' do do  
Yeah my baby knows that I deliver  
Know what's coming when I come through  
I know you got the message I deliver  
So that's exactly what I'm gonna do  
Yeah my baby knows that I deliver  
So that's exactly what I'm gonna do
