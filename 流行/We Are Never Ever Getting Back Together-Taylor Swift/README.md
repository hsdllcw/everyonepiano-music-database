Swift演唱的一首流行歌曲，由Taylor填词，马克斯•马丁、Shellback负责音乐制作，收录在Taylor于2012年发行的第四张录音室专辑《Red》中。

  
_We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together_
以首周超过623000张的销量记录，为歌手成功打破女歌手单曲首周最高销量新纪录，是Taylor Swift第一支拿下美国公告牌百强单曲榜冠军的单曲。

  
由于这首歌歌词描述的是男女恋爱纠纷，就有不少媒体猜测歌词中所描写的男主角为泰勒•斯威夫特前男友：乔•乔纳斯、泰勒•洛特纳和杰克•吉伦哈尔中的一位。而泰勒•斯威夫特并没有回应歌词中描写的抒情对象是谁，但泰勒在谈到和其他制作人一起创作这首歌曲的过程时说：“当时我和朋友在讨论我和前男友复合的事，可这并不是真的，当这位朋友离开之后，马克斯和约翰问我这是怎么回事，我将‘分手-
和好-再次分手-再次和好’这个过程说给他俩听，说完后我们一致认为这个故事可以写成一首歌。接着我就拿起吉他开始创作，这首歌很快就完成了，过程蛮有趣的 。”

### We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together歌词：

I remember when we broke up the first time  
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough," 'cause like  
We hadn't seen each other in a month  
When you said you needed space. (What?)  
Then you come around again and say  
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me."  
Remember how that lasted for a day?  
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you."  
Ooh, we called it off again last night  
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you  
We are never ever ever getting back together,  
We are never ever ever getting back together,  
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me  
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together  
Like, ever...  
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights  
And me falling for it screaming that I'm right  
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind  
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine  
Ooh, you called me up again tonight  
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you  
We are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together  
We are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together  
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me  
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together  
Ooh, yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah  
Ooh, yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah  
Ooh, yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah  
Oh oh oh  
I used to think that we were forever ever  
And I used to say, "Never say never..."  
Uggg... so he calls me up and he's like, "I still love you,"  
And I'm like... "I just... I mean this is exhausting, you know, like,  
We are never getting back together. Like, ever"  
No!  
We are never ever ever getting back together  
We are never ever ever getting back together  
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me  
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together  
We, ooh, getting back together, ohhh,  
We, ooh, getting back together  
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me（talk to me）  
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
