**Dance, Dance** 是芝加哥的一个摇滚乐队Fall Out Boy的歌曲，收录在其第二张录音室专辑From Under the Cork
Tree中。乐队组建于2001年，曾入围格莱美。充满年轻活力朝气，畅快将庞克的不羁气焰完全释放，些许EMO风格夹带流畅声线， Fall Out
Boy虽然和时下偶像团体般，在团名中加入个"Boy"字眼，但是，他们可完全不按牌理出牌，踢爆时下做作男孩偶像团体的面具，给你最热血的新世代之音！

### Dance, Dance歌词：

She says she's no good with words but I'm worse  
Barely stuttered out "A joke of a romantic", or just stuck to my tongue  
Weighed down with words too over-dramatic  
Tonight it's "It can't get much worse"  
Vs. "No one should ever feel like..."

I'm two quarters and a heart down  
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds  
These words are all I have so I'll write them  
So you need them just to get by

Dance, dance  
We're falling apart to half time  
Dance, dance  
And these are the lives you'd love to lead  
Dance, this is the way they'd love  
If they knew how misery loved me

You always fold just before you're found out  
Drink up it's last call,  
Last resort  
But only the first mistake

I'm two quarters and a heart down  
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds  
These words are all I have so I'll write them  
So you need them just to get by

Why don't you show me a little bit of spine  
You've been saving for his mattress, love

Dance, dance  
We're falling apart to half time  
Dance, dance  
And these are the lives you'd love to lead  
Dance, this is the way they'd love  
If they knew how misery loved me

Why don't you show me a little bit of spine  
You've been saving for his mattress (mattress, mattress)  
I only want sympathy in the form of you crawling into bed with me

Dance, dance  
We're falling apart to half time  
Dance, dance  
And these are the lives you'd love to lead

Dance this is the way they'd love (way they'd love)  
Dance this is the way they'd love (way they'd love)  
Dance this is the way they'd love  
If they knew how misery loved me

Dance, dance  
Dance, dance  
Dance, dance  
Dance, dance
