### Sweet but Psycho歌词：

Oh she's sweet but a psycho  
A little bit psycho  
At night she's screamin'  
I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind  
Oh she's hot but a psycho  
So left but she's right though  
At night she's screamin'  
I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind  
She'll make you curse but she a blessing  
She'll rip your shirt within a second  
You'll be coming back back for seconds  
With your plate  
You just can't help it no no  
You'll play alo-o-ong  
Let her lead you o-o-on  
You'll be saying no no  
Then saying yes yes yes  
'Cause she messin' with your head  
Oh she's sweet but a psycho  
A little bit psycho  
At night she's screamin'  
I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind  
Oh she's hot but a psycho  
So left but she's right though  
At night she's screamin'  
I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind  
Grab a cop gun kinda crazy  
She's poison but tasty  
Yeah people say run don't walk away  
'Cause she's sweet but a psycho  
A little bit psycho  
At night she screamin'  
I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind  
See someone said don't drink her potions  
She'll kiss your neck with no emotion  
When she's mean you know you love it  
She tastes so sweet  
Don't sugar coat it no no  
You'll play alo-o-ong  
Let her lead you o-o-on  
You'll be saying no no no no no no  
Then saying yes yes yes  
'Cause she messin' with your head  
Oh she's sweet but a psycho  
A little bit psycho  
At night she's screamin'  
I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind  
Oh she's hot but a psycho  
So left but she's right though  
At night she's screamin'  
I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind  
Grab a cop gun kinda crazy  
She's poison but tasty  
Yeah people say run don't walk away  
'Cause she's sweet but a psycho  
A little bit psycho  
At night she's screamin'  
I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind  
You're just like me you're out your mind  
I know it's strange we're both the crazy kind  
You're tellin' me that I'm insane  
Boy don't pretend that you don't love the pain  
Oh she's sweet but a psycho  
A little bit psycho  
At night she's screamin'  
I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind  
Oh she's hot but a psycho  
So left but she's right though  
At night she's screamin'  
I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind  
Grab a cop gun kinda crazy  
She's poison but tasty  
Yeah people say run don't walk away  
'Cause she's sweet but a psycho  
A little bit psycho  
At night she's screamin'  
I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind
