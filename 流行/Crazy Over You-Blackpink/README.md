### Crazy Over You歌词：

I been known to kiss and tell  
Send girls to wishing wells  
If you're my man I want you to myself  
I know I'll have enemies  
Long as you're into me  
But I don't care cause I got what I need  
Oh yeah  
Need to get with the program  
Boy I keep you close like slow dance  
Hit you with that red don't go there no no man  
Met him  
Then get him  
I make sure we stay  
Got the venom  
To dead him  
If he want a snake  
I mean sneak  
I mean play hide and seek  
Know that I'm gonna find you  
Make sure you get left or you leave  
I saw you  
And knew what I was trying to do  
I had to play it real real smooth  
And once I finally made my move  
I went crazy over you  
Over you only you  
I went crazy over you  
Like eee eee eee  
Feels wrong but it's right right  
Blacked out no night light  
Pinked out like fight night  
Maxed out of my mind and the price right  
Might buy might bite  
Never the regular degular  
Would clean my mess up  
But I rather mess it up  
Simple is so so I need that oh no  
Don't you know I'm loco  
I saw you  
And knew what I was trying to do  
I had to play it real real smooth  
And once I finally made my move  
I went crazy over you  
Over you only you  
I went crazy over you  
Like eee eee eee  
Boy by the time I'm done  
I won't be the only one  
Acting like you made me  
You can't blame me  
Swear once you get a taste  
You gon' take my place  
And you'll love me crazy  
Sound the alarms  
Imma be mad 'till you get me back in them arms  
Charge  
Give me all you got  
Go insane with it better love hard  
Love me like crazy  
I love you crazy
