**Lemon Tree** ，译名《柠檬树》，由Fool's
Garden（愚人花园）于1996年首唱。后被台湾女歌手苏慧伦翻唱后也开始为国人熟知。整首歌曲节奏欢快动听，歌曲也是简单却有意义。很多人表示每当自己不开心的时候，听此曲就会舒心很多。

歌曲用幽默诙谐的曲调，似乎告诉我们一个深刻的人生领悟：也许你给不了我你曾描绘的美丽蓝天，但你给了我一棵柠檬树，既如此，我也有权利寻找另一处风景，它会让我获得快乐！音符和歌词像一个个跳跃的小精灵，调皮又律动感极强！

### Lemon Tree歌词：

I'm sitting here in the boring room  
It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon  
I'm wasting my time  
I got nothing to do  
I'm hanging around  
I'm waiting for you  
But nothing ever happens and I wonder  
I'm driving around in my car  
I'm driving too fast  
I'm driving too far  
I'd like to change my point of view  
I feel so lonely  
I'm waiting for you  
But nothing ever happens and I wonder  
I wonder how  
I wonder why  
Yesterday you told me about the blue blue sky  
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree  
I'm turning my head up and down  
I'm turning turning turning turning turning around  
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree  
Sing dah  
I'm sitting here  
I miss the power  
I'd like to go out taking a shower  
But there's a heavy cloud inside my head  
I feel so tired  
Put myself into bed  
While nothing ever happens and I wonder  
Isolation is not good for me  
Isolation I don't want to sit on the lemon tree  
I'm steppin' around in the desert of joy  
Baby anyhow I'll get another toy  
And everything will happen and you wonder  
I wonder how  
I wonder why  
Yesterday you told me about the blue blue sky  
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree  
I'm turning my head up and down  
I'm turning turning turning turning turning around  
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree  
Yellow wonder wonder  
I wonder how  
I wonder why  
Yesterday you told me about the blue blue sky  
And all that I can see and all that I can see  
And all that I can see  
Is just a yellow lemon tree
