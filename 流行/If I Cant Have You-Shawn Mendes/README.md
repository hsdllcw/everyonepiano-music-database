Mendes给人的印象就像是无公害水果。除鲜嫩可人，各种养眼，还安全无毒副作用。尤其那亲切而又略显矜持的笑容，更像邻家男孩。他的声线干净如晨露，让人感觉纯静，却又隐带甘甜。看似舒缓，但激情爆发处，有着让人欲罢不能的节奏感。

### If I Can't Have You歌词：

I can't write one song that's not about you  
Can't drink without thinking about you  
Is it too late to tell you that  
Everything means nothing if I can't have you  
I'm in Toronto and I got this view  
But I might as well be in a hotel room  
Yeah it doesn't matter 'cause I'm so consumed  
Spending all my nights reading texts from you  
Oh I'm good at keeping my distance  
I know that you're the feeling I'm missing  
You know that I hate to admit it  
But everything means nothing if I can't have you  
I can't write one song that's not about you  
Can't drink without thinking about you  
Is it too late to tell you that  
Everything means nothing if I can't have you  
I can't write one song that's not about you  
Can't drink without thinking about you  
Is it too late to tell you that  
Everything means nothing if I can't have you  
I'm so sorry that my timing is off  
But I can't move on if we're still gonna talk  
Is it wrong for me to not want half  
I want all of you all the strings attached  
Oh I'm good at keeping my distance  
I know that you're the feeling I'm missing  
You know that I hate to admit it  
But everything means nothing if I can't have you  
I can't write one song that's not about you  
Can't drink without thinking about you  
Is it too late to tell you that  
Everything means nothing if I can't have you  
I can't write one song that's not about you  
Can't drink without thinking about you  
Is it too late to tell you that  
Everything means nothing if I can't have you  
I'm trying to move on forget you but I hold on  
Everything means nothing everything means nothing babe  
I'm trying to move on forget you but I hold on  
Everything means nothing if I can't have you  
I can't write one song that's not about you  
Can't drink without thinking about you  
Is it too late to tell you that  
Everything means nothing if I can't have you  
I can't write one song that's not about you  
Can't drink without thinking about you  
Is it too late to tell you that  
Everything means nothing if I can't have you
