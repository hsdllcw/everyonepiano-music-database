### Pressure歌词：

I'm in a mood  
I'm still tasting you  
This ain't 'round for days  
Crave you back with me  
Pretend I'll be good  
Give me silence silence  
I just need your touch  
Know your violence violence  
Have some on the tip of your tongue  
In the darkness darkness  
We go on and on  
Always under pressure  
Pressure uh  
Can't take it back Back  
When you talk like that no  
You make me so real  
Stay up in my bed  
No one wants this end  
Yeah yeah  
Give me silencе silence  
I just need your touch  
Know your violencе violence  
Have some on the tip of your tongue  
In the darkness darkness  
We go on and on  
Always under pressure  
Pressure uh  
I don't I don't know what to do  
It just feels so fake in the room  
I don't  
I don't don't know what to do  
It just feels so fake in the room  
Aw yeah  
Always under pressure  
Give me silence silence  
I just need your touch  
Know your violence violence  
Has some on the tip of your tongue  
Pressure pressure  
In the darkness darkness  
We go on and on  
Always under pressure
