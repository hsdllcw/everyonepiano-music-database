### Oath歌词：

Yo, my best friend, best friend til the very end  
Cause best friends, best friends don't have to pretend  
You need a hand, and I'm right there right beside you  
You in the dark, I'll be the bright light to guide you  
'member the time, time, times sneaking out the house  
All of the time, time, times that you had your doubts  
And don't forget all the trouble we got into  
We got something you can't undo, do  
Laughing so damn hard  
Crashed your dad's new car  
All the scars we share  
I promise, I swear  
Wherever you go, just always remember  
That you gotta home for now and forever  
And if you get low, just call me whenever  
This is my oath to you  
Wherever you go, just always remember  
You're never alone, we're birds of a feather  
And we'll never change, no matter the weather  
This is my oath to you  
I know I drive you crazy, hmm… sometimes  
I know I call you lazy, and that's most times  
But you complete me, and that's no lie  
You are my tuxedo, and I'm your bow tie  
We in the car, sing, sing, singin' our song  
Walk in the building, tear it down like we King Kong  
And in my eyes, you could do do no wrong  
You got a best friend sing, sing along  
Laughing so damn hard  
Crashed your dad's new car  
All the scars we share  
I promise, I swear  
Wherever you go, just always remember  
That you gotta home for now and forever  
And if you get low, just call me whenever  
This is my oath to you  
Wherever you go, just always remember  
You're never alone, we're birds of a feather  
And we'll never change, no matter the weather  
This is my oath to you  
Ohhh… I'll never let you go  
Ohhh… Woah, This is my oath to you  
Ohhh… Just thought that you should know  
Ohhh… Woah, This is my oath to you  
Wherever you go, just always remember  
That you gotta home for now and forever  
And if you get low, just call me whenever  
This is my oath to you  
Wherever you go, just always remember  
You're never alone, we're birds of a feather  
And we'll never change, no matter the weather  
This is my oath to you  
Ohhh… You should know, you should know  
you should know, you should know yeah  
Ohhh… Woah, This is my oath to you  
Ohhh… Wherever you go just always remember  
You're never alone, we're birds of a feather  
Ohhh… And we'll never change, no matter the weather  
This is my oath to you
