### Miracles (Someone Special)歌词：

[Chris Martin:]  
My father said never give up son  
Just look how good Cassius become  
Muhammad, Mahatma, and Nelson  
Not scared to be strong  
Now you could run and just say they’re right  
No I'll never be no one in my whole life  
Or you could turn and say no wait they're wrong  
And get to keep on dancing all life long  
My father said never give up son  
Just look what Amelia and Joan done  
Or Rosa, Teresa their war won  
Not scared to be strong  
Now you could run and just say they’re right  
No I’ll never be no one in my whole life  
Or you could turn and say no wait, they’re wrong  
And get to keep on dancing all life long  
Yeah you could be someone special  
You've got bright in your brains and lightning in your veins  
You'll go higher than they've ever gone  
In you I see someone special  
You've got fire in your eyes and when you realize you'll go further than we've
ever gone  
Just turn it on  
[Big Sean:]  
Look I paid my intuition I couldn't afford tuition  
My funds was insufficient, it felt like I'm in prison  
Until I realized I had to set my mind free  
I was trusting statistics more than I trust me  
Get a degree, good job, 401k, but I’m trying to turn k’s to m’s, what does it
take?  
And maybe I could be the new Ali of music prolly  
Instead of doing it just as a hobby like these boys told me to  
I guess you either watch the show or you show and prove  
Prove it to them or you prove it to yourself but honestly it's better if you
do it for yourself  
Never complacent till we hit the oasis  
One life don't waste it feel my heart races, success I taste it, ah  
Ah we on the verge of getting every single thing that we deserve  
[Chris Martin:]  
Yeah you could be someone special  
You've got fire in your eyes I see heaven inside you'll go further than we've
ever gone  
In you I see someone special  
You've got bright in your brains you can break through those chains you'll go
higher than we've ever gone  
Just turn it on  
In you I see someone special  
Don't go to war with yourself  
Just turn, just turn, just turn it on and you can't go wrong
