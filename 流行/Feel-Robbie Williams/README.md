### Feel歌词：

Come on hold my hand  
I wanna contact the living  
Not sure I understand  
This role I've been given

I sit and talk to God  
And he just laughs at by pledge  
My head speaks a language  
I don't understand

I just wanna feel real love  
Feel the home that I live in  
'Cause I got too much life  
Running through my veins, going to waste

I don't wanna die  
But I ain't keen on living either  
Before I fall in love  
I'm preparing to leave her

I scare myself to death  
That's why I keep on running  
Before I've arrived  
I can see myself coming

I just wanna feel real love  
Feel the home that I live in  
'Cause I got too much life  
Running through my veins, going to waste

And I need to feel  
Real love  
And a life ever after  
I cannot give it up

I just wanna feel real love  
Feel the home that I live in  
I got too much love  
Running through my veins, to go to waste

I just wanna feel real love  
In a life ever after, there's a hole in my soul  
You can see it in my face  
It's a real big place

Come and hold my hand  
I want to contact the living  
Not sure I understand  
This role I've been given

Not sure I understand  
Not sure I understand  
Not sure I understand  
Not sure I understand
