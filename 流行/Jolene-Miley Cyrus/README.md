### Jolene歌词：

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene  
Oh, I'm begging of you please don't take my man  
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene  
Please don't take him even though you can  
Your beauty is beyond compare  
With flaming locks of auburn hair  
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green  
Your smile is like a breath of spring  
Your skin is soft like summer rain  
And I can not compete with you, Jolene  
And I can easily understand  
How you could easily take my man  
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene  
He talks about you in his sleep  
There's nothing I can do to keep  
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene, Jolene  
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene  
Please don't take him even though you can  
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene  
Please don't take him even though you can  
I had to have this talk with you  
My happiness depends on you  
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene  
And you could have your choice of men  
But I could never love again  
He's the only one for me, Jolene, Jolene  
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene  
I'm begging of you please don't take my man  
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene  
Please don't take him even though you can  
Jolene, Jolene
