### Obey歌词：

Oliver Sykes：  
Another day another post-traumatic order  
Brainwashed and feeling fine  
I bit off more than I could chew when I looked closer  
So I stabbed a fork in my eye  
Think I'm losing my f**king mind  
Don't know where to turn now I'm blind  
Destroy yourself it feels so good to fade away  
Why do you wanna hurt yourself  
Die for something else  
Don't let your conscience get in the way  
Obey we hope you have a lovely day  
Obey you don't want us to come out and play away now now  
There's nothing to see here it's under control  
We're only gambling with your soul  
Obey whatever you do  
Just don't wake up and smell the corruption  
YUNGBLUD：  
Do you feel that yeah  
Another day another systematic nightmare  
Commemorate a wonderful life  
Bite me first I'll bite you back melodramatic laughter  
I stabbed a knife in my eye  
Think I'm out my f**king mind  
Brainwashed and I'm feeling fine  
Destroy yourself it feels too good to fade away  
Why do I wanna hurt myself  
Should I die for something else  
I let my conscience get in the way  
Oliver Sykes/YUNGBLUD：  
Obey we hope you have a lovely day  
Obey you don't want us to come out and play away now now  
There's nothing to see here it's under control  
We're only gambling with your soul  
Obey whatever you do  
Just don't wake up and smell the corruption  
Oliver Sykes：  
When you feed them it's lethal  
Tell me how you're gonna hurt yourself  
You call yourselves peaceful  
You monsters are people  
You f**king monsters are people  
Oliver Sykes/YUNGBLUD：  
Obey we're gonna show you how to behave  
Obey it's nicer when you can't see the chains  
Obey we hope you have a lovely day  
Obey you don't want us to come out and play away now now  
There's nothing to see here it's under control  
It's under control  
We're only gambling with your soul  
With your soul  
Obey whatever you do  
Just don't wake up and smell the corruption  
Smell the corruption  
Smell the corruption
