### The Weight歌词：

I want to go back, forget that it's over  
Painted in black, when you left me alone  
I never knew, she was sleeping next door  
With the kid I grew up with, and I can’t go back to her  
Anymore, no more  
You tell me you were happier within, you want me to stay  
And you tell me that you needed time but you push me away  
But then you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks  
No, I can’t lift the weight  
Put you in the past, try to forget you cause it’s over  
And every time you ask I'll pretend I'm okay  
In the middle of the night when I don't feel right  
I dream I can hold you, and I can't go back to you anymore, yeah, yeah  
You tell me you were happier within, you want me to stay  
And you tell me that you needed time but you push me away  
But then you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks  
But, I can't lift the weight, and I can't lift the weight  
And I can't lift the weigh, no I can't life the weight  
Yeah, you stand on my shoulders and my heart just breaks  
And I can't lift the weigh, no I can't life the weight  
Yeah, you stand on my shoulders and my heart just breaks  
And I can't lift the weigh, no I can't life the weight  
Yeah, you lower your standards and I raise the stakes  
And I can't lift the weigh, no I can't life the weight  
You tell me you were happier within but you want me to stay  
And you tell me that you needed time but you, you push me away  
But then you try to take it back, my heavy heart just breaks  
But, I can't lift the weight, and I can't lift the weight  
You tell me you were happier within, you want me to stay  
You told me that you needed time but you, you push me away  
And then you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks  
Say someday you will change, but I don't wanna wait
