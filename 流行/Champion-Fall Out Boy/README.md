### Champion歌词：

Champion, champion  
I'm calling you from the future  
To let you know we made a mistake  
And there's a fog from the past  
That's giving me, giving me such a headache  
And I'm back with a madness  
I'm a champion of the people who don't believe in champions  
I got nothing but dreams inside  
I got nothing but dreams  
I'm just young enough to still believe, still believe  
But young enough not to know what to believe in  
Young enough not to know what to believe in, yeah  
If I can live through this  
If I can live through this  
If I can live through this  
I can do anything  
If I can live through this  
If I can live through this  
If I can live through this  
I can do anything  
Champion, champion  
Champion, champion  
I got rage every day, on the inside  
The only thing I do is sit around and kill time  
I'm trying to blow out the pilot light, I'm trying to blow out the light  
I'm just young enough to still believe, still believe  
But young enough not to know what to believe in  
Young enough not to know what to believe  
If I can live through this  
If I can live through this  
If I can live through this  
I can do anything  
If I can live through this  
If I can live through this  
If I can live through this  
I can do anything  
Champion, champion  
I can do anything  
Champion, champion  
And I can do anything  
Champion, champion  
And I can do anything  
Champion, champion  
I can do anything  
If I can live through this  
If I can live through this  
If I can live through this  
I can do anything  
(I can do anything I can)  
If I can live through this  
(Can do anything, anything, yeah)  
If I can live through this  
If I can live through this  
If I can live through this,  
If I can live through, live through this  
If I can live through this (If I can live through this)  
If I can live through this (If I can live through)  
If I can live through this (If I can live through this)  
I can do anything  
(I can do anything)  
If I can live through this  
(I can do anything)  
If I can live through this  
(I can do anything)  
If I can live through this  
I can do anything  
Champion, champion
