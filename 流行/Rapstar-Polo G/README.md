### Rapstar歌词：

Shout out my n***a Synco  
Uh  
Tuned up  
Copped a BMW new deposit I picked up another bag  
Like f**k it I'ma count while I'm in it  
I hear planes flyin' crowds screamin' money counters chains clangin'  
S**t I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'  
I ain't jokin' do it sound like I'm kiddin'  
I been makin' like two thousand a minute  
So high up through the clouds I was swimmin'  
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it  
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it  
And we might have a child when I'm finished  
Uh I won't love a ho after we f**k she can't get near me  
Only b***h I give a conversation to is Siri  
My pants Amiri yes I'm winnin' clearly  
I'm the chosen one seen my potential so they fear me  
Lately I've been prayin' God I wonder can You hear me  
Thinkin' 'bout the old me I swear I miss you dearly  
Stay down 'til you come up I've been stickin' to that theory  
Every day a battle I'm exhausted and I'm weary  
Make sure I smile in public when alone my eyes teary  
I fought through it all but that s**t hurt me severely  
I've been gettin' high to hide behind my insecurities  
Takin' different pills but I know it ain't gon'  
Uh copped a BMW new deposit I picked up another bag  
Like f**k it I'ma count while I'm in it  
I hear planes flyin' crowds screamin' money counters chains clangin'  
S**t I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'  
I ain't jokin' do it sound like I'm kiddin'  
I been makin' like two thousand a minute  
So high up through the clouds I was swimmin'  
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it  
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it  
Uh uh  
And we might have a child when I'm finished  
They say I'm Pac rebirth never put out a weak verse  
Homicides when we lurk I'ma step 'til my feet hurt  
Weren't puttin' them streets first  
White tees turned burgundy T-shirts  
Lookin' for somethin' real he stuck in a deep search  
Anxiety killin' me I just want to leave Earth  
When they ask if I'm okay it just make everything seem worse  
Try and explain your feelings sound like something you rehearsed  
Stabbed me in my back with a clean smirk  
Lookin' so deep into your eyes I can read your thoughts so  
Shut the f**k I mean please don't talk  
I done been through too much and I don't need another loss  
Put that on every war scar for every battle I fought  
Uh copped a BMW new deposit I picked up another bag  
Like f**k it I'ma count while I'm in it  
I hear planes flyin' crowds screamin' money counters chains clangin'  
S**t I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'  
I ain't jokin' do it sound like I'm kiddin'  
I been makin' like two thousand a minute  
So high up through the clouds I was swimmin'  
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it  
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it  
And we might have a child when I'm finished  
When I'm finished when I'm finished
