### Stockholm Syndrome歌词：

[Harry:]  
Who’s that shadow holding me hostage?  
I’ve been here for days  
Who’s this whisper telling me that I’m never gonna get away?

[Zayn:]  
I know they’ll be coming to find me soon  
But I fear I’m getting used to  
Being held by you

[Chorus:]  
Oh, baby, look what you’ve done to me  
Oh, baby, look what you’ve done now  
Oh, baby, I’ll never leave if you keep holding me this way, oh o-oh  
Oh, baby, look what you’ve done to me  
Oh, baby, you’ve got me tied down  
Oh, baby, I’ll never leave if you keep holding me this way, oh o-oh

[Louis:]  
Who’s this man that’s holding your hand  
And talking ‘bout your eyes?  
Used to sing about being free but now he’s changed his mind

[Niall:]  
I know they’ll be coming to find me soon  
But my Stockholm syndrome is in your room  
Yeah, I fell for you!

[Chorus:]  
Oh, baby, look what you’ve done to me  
Oh, baby, look what you’ve done now  
Oh, baby, I’ll never leave if you keep holding me this way, oh o-oh  
Oh, baby, look what you’ve done to me  
Oh, baby, you’ve got me tied down  
Oh, baby, I’ll never leave if you keep holding me this way, oh o-oh

[Liam:]  
All my life I’ve been on my own  
I use a light to guide me home  
But now together we're alone  
And there's no other place I'd ever wanna go

Baby, look what you’ve done  
(look what you’ve done to me)

[Chorus:]  
Oh, baby, look what you’ve done to me  
Oh, baby, look what you’ve done now  
Oh, baby, I’ll never leave if you keep holding me this way, oh o-oh  
Oh, baby, look what you’ve done to me  
Oh, baby, you’ve got me tied down  
Oh, baby, I’ll never leave if you keep holding me this way, oh o-oh
