### With a Little Help from My Friends歌词：

What would you think if I sang out of tune  
Would you stand up and walk out on me?  
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song  
And I'll try not to sing out of key  
Oh I get by with a little help from my friends  
Mm I get high with a little help from my friends  
Mm gonna try with a little help from my friends

What do I do when my love is away?  
(Does it worry you to be alone?)  
How do I feel by the end of the day?  
(Are you sad because you're on your own?)  
No I get by with a little help from my friends  
Mm I get high with a little help from my friends  
Mm gonna try with a little help from my friends

(Do you need anybody?)  
I need somebody to love  
(Could it be anybody?)  
I want somebody to love

(Would you believe in a love at first sight?)  
Yes I'm certain that it happens all the time  
(What do you see when you turn out the light?)  
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine  
Oh I get by with a little help from my friends  
Mm I get high with a little help from my friends  
Oh I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends

(Do you need anybody?)  
I just need someone to love  
(Could it be anybody?)  
I want somebody to love

Oh I get by with a little help from my friends  
Mm gonna try with a little help from my friends  
Oh I get high with a little help from my friends  
Yes I get by with a little help from my friends  
With a little help from my friends
