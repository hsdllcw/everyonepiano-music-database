《 **My Way** 》是一首欧美著名英文流行曲，旋律源自法国名曲《一如往日》（"Comme
d'habitude"），法文原版由克罗德•法兰索瓦（Claude François）、雅克•赫霍（Jacques Revaux）及吉尔•提伯（Gilles
Thibaut）在1967年共同创作，随后由保罗•安卡（Paul Anka）改编成英文版，1969年首次收录在弗兰克•西纳特拉（Frank
Sinatra）同名大碟，自此风靡全球。这首歌不但成为Sinatra的代表作，在流行文化上亦常被用作为告别曲，表示一场表演的结束或一个人的离开。这亦是英国最受欢迎的丧礼挽曲。相比英文版哀伤的曲调，法文版的配乐则有忧伤、轻快、或摇滚版本。

该曲的歌词可以唤起演唱者骄傲自大的情感，忽视过去的失败，容易使人自我感觉良好。《 _My Way_
》道出了20世纪美国人心底的人生诉求，那就是过一种自信、拼搏、无悔的生活，该曲对流行文化产生了深远影响。

### My Way歌词：

And now the end is near  
And so I face the final curtain  
My friend I'll say it clear  
I'll state my case of which I'm certain  
I've lived a life that's full  
I traveled each and every highway  
And more much more than this I did it my way  
Regrets I've had a few  
But then again too few to mention  
I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption  
I planned each charted course each careful step along the byway  
And more much more than this I did it my way  
Yes there were times I'm sure you knew  
When I bit off more than I could chew  
But through it all when there was doubt  
I ate it up and spit it out  
I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way  
I've loved I've laughed and cried  
I've had my fill my share of losing  
And now as tears subside I find it all so amusing  
To think I did all that  
And may I say not in a shy way  
Oh no oh no not me I did it my way  
For what is a man what has he got  
If not himself then he has naught  
To say the things he truly feels and not the words of one who kneels  
The record shows I took the blows and did it my way  
Yes it was my way
