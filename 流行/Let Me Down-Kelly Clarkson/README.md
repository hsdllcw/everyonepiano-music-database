### Let Me Down歌词：

I think I might be a fortune teller  
I read your face just like a letter  
The funny thing about forever  
Is it comes with a side of never never  
I can't buy into what you're selling  
And no it's not that I don't want it  
Believe me I love to close my eyes, enjoy the ride  
But you reek of indecision and I...  
I know, I know, I know,  
I know, I know, I know

You're only gonna let me down  
When it counts, you countdown  
You're only gonna turn me out  
As I burn, you burn out  
You're only gonna make me feel so crazy  
But when I think we could be something  
You go and let me down, let me down, oh

I am too smart to let you in here  
But I'm just dumb enough to linger  
I wanna think that you'll be different  
Smoking mirrors are so clever clever  
I pretend that things aren't so bad  
And what you say will actually happen  
I've been dying to open my eyes  
See you try instead of always leaving me out to dry

You're only gonna let me down  
When it counts, you countdown  
You're only gonna turn me out  
As I burn, you burn out  
You're only gonna make me feel so crazy  
But when I think we could be something  
You go and let me down, let me down, oh

I need you to be there when you say you're gonna be  
I care too much and you care enough to leave  
I want some place to rest my head without worrying  
It's not fair, It's not fair, It's not fair, It's not fair  
It's not fair to me, cause I know by now

You're only gonna let me down  
When it counts, you countdown  
You're only gonna turn me out  
As I burn, you burn out  
You're only gonna make me feel so crazy  
But when I think we could be something  
You go and let me down, let me down

You're only gonna let me down  
When it counts, you countdown  
You're only gonna turn me out  
As I burn, you burn out  
You're only gonna make me feel so crazy  
But when I think we could be something  
You go and let me down, let me down, oh
