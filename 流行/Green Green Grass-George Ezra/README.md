### Green Green Grass歌词：

Well she moves like lightning  
And she counts to three  
And she turns out all the lights  
And says she's coming for me  
Now put your hands up this is a heist  
And there's no one in here living  
Gonna make it out alive  
Loading up  
When the sun goes down  
Getaway car for two young lovers  
Me and the girl straight out of town  
Over the hills and undercover  
Undercover  
Undercover  
She said  
Green green grass  
Blue blue sky  
You better throw a party on  
The day that I die  
Green green grass  
Blue blue sky  
You better throw a party on  
The day that I die  
We go together Adam and Eve  
But the girl is so much more  
Than just another apple thief  
Yeah she's a genius  
Genius  
Watch and learn  
As she sets the world on fire  
Just to watch the sucker burn  
Loading up  
When the sun goes down  
Getaway car for two young lovers  
Me and the girl straight out of town  
Over the hills and undercover  
Undercover  
Undercover  
She said  
Green green grass  
Blue blue sky  
You better throw a party on  
The day that I die  
Green green grass  
Blue blue sky  
You better throw a party on  
The day that I die  
Throw a party  
Hey  
Throw a party yeah  
Throw a party  
Woo  
On the day that I die  
Throw a party  
Yay  
Throw a party babe  
Throw a party  
On the day that I die  
Loading up  
When the sun goes down  
Getaway car for two young lovers  
Me and the girl straight out of town  
Over the hills and undercover  
Undercover  
Undercover  
She said  
Green green grass  
Blue blue sky  
You better throw a party on  
The day that I die  
Green green grass  
Blue blue sky  
You better throw a party on  
The day that I die  
Green green grass  
Blue blue sky  
You better throw a party on  
The day that I die  
Green green grass  
Blue blue sky  
You better throw a party on  
The day that I die
