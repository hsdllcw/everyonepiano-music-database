### Together Again歌词：

There are times  
When I look above  
And beyond  
There are times when I feel your love  
Around me baby  
I'll never forget my baby  
(I'll never forget you)

There are times when I look above and beyond  
There are times when I feel your love around me baby  
I'll never forget my baby

When I feel that I don't belong  
Draw my strength  
From the words when you said  
Hey it's about you baby  
Look deeper inside you baby

[BRIDGE]  
Dream about us together again  
What I want us together again baby  
I know we'll be together again cuz

[CHORUS:]  
Everywhere I go  
Every smile I see  
I know you are there  
Smilin back at me  
Dancin in moonlight  
I know you are free  
Cuz I can see your star  
Shinin down on me

(together again, ooh)  
Good times we'll share again  
(together again, ooh)  
Makes me wanna dance  
(together again, ooh)  
Say it loud and proud  
(together again, ooh)  
All my love's for you

Always been a true angel to me  
Now above  
I can't wait for you to wrap your wings around me baby  
Oooh wrap them around me baby

Sometimes hear you whisperin  
No more pain  
No worries will you ever see now baby  
I'm so happy for my baby

[BRIDGE]

[CHORUS]

(together again, ooh)  
Good times we'll share again  
(together again, ooh)  
Ooh it makes me wanna dance  
(together again, ooh)  
Say it loud and proud  
(together again, ooh)  
All my love's for you

There are times when I look above and beyond  
There are times when I feel you smile upon me baby  
I'll never forget my baby

What I'd give just to hold you close  
As on earth  
In heaven we will be together baby  
Together again my baby

[CHORUS (2x)]
