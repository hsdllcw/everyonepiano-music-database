### Waste It On Me歌词：

You say love is messed up  
You say that it don't work  
You don't wanna try no no  
You don't wanna try no no  
And baby I'm no stranger  
To heartbreak and the pain of  
Always being let go  
Always being let go  
And I know there's no making this right this right  
And I know there's no changing your mind your mind  
But we both found each other tonight tonight  
So if love is nothing more than just a waste of your time  
Waste it on me  
Waste it on me  
Waste it on me  
Tell me why not waste it on me  
Waste it on me  
Waste it on me  
Baby why not waste it on me  
Waste it on me  
Waste it on me  
Tell me why not waste it on me  
Waste it on me  
Waste it on me  
Waste it on me  
So we don't gotta go there  
Past lovers and warfare  
It's just you and me now  
Yeah yeah  
I don't know your secrets  
But I'll pick up the pieces  
And pull you close to me now  
Yeah yeah  
And I know there's no making this right this right  
Yeah  
And I know there's no changing your mind your mind  
Oh  
But we both found each other tonight tonight  
Oh yeah  
So if love is nothing more than just a waste of your time  
Waste it on me  
Waste it on me  
Waste it on me  
Tell me why not waste it on me  
Waste it on me  
Waste it on me  
Baby why not waste it on me  
Waste it on me  
Waste it on me  
Tell me why not waste it on me  
Waste it on me  
Waste it on me  
Tell me why not  
Yay  
Waste it on me  
Don't you think there must be a reason  
Yeah like we had our names  
Don't you think we got another season that come after spring  
I wanna be your summer  
I wanna be your wave  
Treat me like a comma  
I'll take you to a new phrase  
Yeah come just eat me and throw me away  
If I'm not your taste babe waste  
Waste it on me  
And I know there's no making this right this right  
Yeah  
And I know there's no changing your mind your mind  
Oh  
But we both found each other tonight tonight  
Oh yeah  
So if love is nothing more than just a waste of your time  
Waste it on me  
Waste it on me  
Waste it on me  
Tell me why not waste it on me  
Waste it on me  
Waste it on me  
Baby why not waste it on me  
Waste it on me  
Waste it on me  
Tell me why not waste it on me  
Waste it on me  
Waste it on me  
Tell me why not
