**Y.M.C.A.** 是美国Disco乐团The Village People的代表作之一。收录在1980年发行的专辑Can´t Stop the
Music当中 。但是作为单曲，Y.M.C.A早在1969年12月31日已经发行 ，由Henri Belolo ，Phil Hurtt ，Jacques
Morali 和Peter Whitehead共同创作。这首单曲在1979年The Billboard Hot 100榜单中最高排名第2 。

  
2014年《中国好声音》杨坤战队四强所表演的Young Man就是这首歌的中文版。
美剧Friends第二季21集结尾时Monica在餐厅表演时放的音乐也是这首歌。

  
YMCA本来是指The Young Men's Christian
Association，基督教青年会。于是这首同名歌一发行就成为了男同性恋社区的代表曲，受到男同性恋者的追捧。2007年，The Village
People乐队的主唱和成立者Victor Willis在接受采访时表示 :“the lyrics in Y.M.C.A. were not meant
to be innuendo about gay cruising but about hanging out with your straight
buddies.”（ _Y.M.C.A._ 的歌词不是暗指同性恋间的寻欢作乐，而是指直男之间的普通玩乐。）

### Y.M.C.A.歌词：

Young man, there's no need to feel down.  
I said, young man, pick yourself off the ground.  
I said, young man, 'cause you're in a new town  
There's no need to be unhappy.

Young man, there's a place you can go.  
I said, young man, when you're short on your dough.  
You can stay there, and I'm sure you will find  
Many ways to have a good time.

It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.  
It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.

They have everything for you men to enjoy,  
You can hang out with all the boys ...

It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.  
It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.

You can get yourself clean, you can have a good meal,  
You can do whatever you feel...

Young man, are you listening to me?  
I said, young man, what do you want to be?  
I said, young man, you can make real your dreams.  
But you got to know this one thing!

No man does it all by himself.  
I said, young man, put your pride on the shelf,  
And just go there, to the Y.M.C.A.  
I'm sure they can help you today.

It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.  
It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.

They have everything for you men to enjoy,  
You can hang out with all the boys...

It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.  
It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.

You can get yourself clean, you can have a good meal,  
You can do whatever you feel ...

Young man, I was once in your shoes.  
I said, I was down and out with the blues.  
I felt no man cared if I were alive.  
I felt the whole world was so jive ...

That's when someone came up to me,  
And said, young man, take a walk up the street.  
There's a place there called the Y.M.C.A.  
They can start you back on your way.

It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.  
It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.

They have everything for you men to enjoy,  
You can hang out with all the boys...

Y.M.C.A....you'll find it at the Y.M.C.A.

Young man, young man, there's no need to feel down.  
Young man, young man, get yourself off the ground.

Y.M.C.A....you'll find it at the Y.M.C.A.

Young man, young man, there's no need to feel down.  
Young man, young man, get yourself off the ground.

Y.M.C.A....just go to the Y.M.C.A.

Young man, young man, are you listening to me?  
Young man, young man, what do you wanna be?
