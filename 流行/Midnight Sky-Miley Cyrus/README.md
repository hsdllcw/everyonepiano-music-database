《 _Midnight Sky_ 》是Miley
Cyrus对自我的大胆重塑，她将目光投向粗犷的摇滚歌声，在该曲中展现出了史蒂薇•妮克丝一版的风采，她沙哑的嗓音自然而然地流露出摇滚感。该曲并没有落入自我赋权的俗套，当她说到自己不属于任何人时，她并不是在宽慰自己，而是在简单地陈述事实，让听众听到她的心声。她在该曲中掌控主动权，塑造自己的人格。该曲的歌词充满情感，通过摇滚释放自我。

### Midnight Sky歌词：

La-la la-la la  
Yeah it's been a long night and the mirror's telling me to go home  
Go home  
But it's been a long time since I felt this good on my own  
Uh  
Lotta years went by with my hands tied up in your ropes  
Your ropes  
Forever and ever no more  
No more  
The midnight sky is the road I'm takin'  
Head high up in the clouds  
Oh oh  
I was born to run I don't belong to anyone oh no  
Don't need to be loved by you  
By you  
Fire in my lungs can't bite the Devil on my tongue oh no  
Don't need to be loved by you  
See my lips on her mouth everybody's talkin' now baby  
Ooh you know it's true  
Yeah yeah  
That I was born to run I don't belong to anyone oh no  
Don't need to be loved by you  
Loved by you  
La-la la-la la  
She got her hair pulled back 'cause the sweat's drippin' off of her face  
Her face  
Said "It ain't so bad if I wanna make a couple mistakes"  
You should know right now that I never stayed put in one place  
Forever and ever no more  
No more  
The midnight sky is the road I'm takin'  
Head high up in the clouds  
Oh oh  
I was born to run I don't belong to anyone oh no  
Don't need to be loved by you  
By you  
Fire in my lungs can't bite the Devil on my tongue oh no  
Don't need to be loved by you  
See my lips on her mouth everybody's talkin' now baby  
Ooh you know it's true  
Yeah  
That I was born to run I don't belong to anyone oh no  
Don't need to be loved by you  
By you  
Oh  
I don't hide blurry eyes like you  
Like you  
I was born to run I don't belong to anyone oh no  
I don't need to be loved by you  
By you  
Fire in my lungs can't bite the Devil on my tongue oh no  
Don't need to be loved by you  
See his hands 'round my waist thought you never be replaced baby  
Ooh you know it's true  
Yeah  
That I was born to run I don't belong to anyone oh no  
Don't need to be loved by you  
Yeah  
La-la la-la la la-la  
You know it's true you know it's true  
Loved by you
