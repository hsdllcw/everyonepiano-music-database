**How Do I Live** 最开始是词曲女王Diane Warren为LeAnn
Rimes量身订作的歌，并提供为电影《空中监狱》的主题曲。但电影导演认为LeAnn Rimes的稚气歌声无法呈现电影中成熟韵味，于是找来Trisha
Yearwood主唱。这首歌获得了第70届奥斯卡最佳歌曲提名奖。相比之下，Trisha Yearwood的版本更受欢迎，流传更广。

  
LeAnn Rimes
1996年初出道，便以13岁清纯乡村女歌手之姿，超龄纯熟的歌技，在全球造成一股小莱姆热潮。两座葛莱美奖、四座Billboard音乐奖及全美音乐等奖项之肯定，已为人妇的LeAnn
Rimes，继续在乐坛演出她越显成熟的歌唱魅力。

### How Do I Live歌词：

How do I get through one night without you  
If I had to live without you  
What kinda life would that be  
Oh I need you in my arms, need you to hold  
You are my world, my heart, my soul  
If you ever leave  
Baby you would take away everything good in my life  
And tell me now  
How do I live without you  
I want to know  
How do I breathe without you  
If you ever go  
How do I ever, ever survive  
How do I, how do I, oh how do I live  
Without you  
There would be no sun in my sky  
There would be no love in my life  
There would be no world left for me  
And I, baby, I don't know what I would do  
I'd be lost if I lost you  
If you ever leave  
Baby you would take away everything real in my life  
And tell me now  
How do I live without you  
I want to know  
How do I breathe without you  
If you ever go  
How do I ever, ever survive  
How do I, how do I, oh how do I live  
Please tell me baby  
If you ever leave  
Baby you would take away everything  
Need you with me  
Baby don't you know that you are everything good in my life  
And tell me now  
How do I live without you  
I want to know  
How do I breathe without you  
If you ever go  
How do I ever, ever survive  
How do I, how do I, oh how do I live  
How do I live without you  
How do I live without you, baby  
How do I live without you
