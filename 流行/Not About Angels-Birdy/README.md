### Not About Angels歌词：

We know full well there's just time  
So is it wrong to dance this line?  
If your heart was full of love  
Could you give it up?

'Cause what about, what about angels?  
They will come, they will go, make us special

Don't give me up  
Don't give...  
Me up

How unfair, it's just our luck  
Found something real that's out of touch  
But if you'd searched the whole wide world  
Would you dare to let it go?

'Cause what about, what about angels?  
They will come, they will go, make us special

Don't give me up  
Don't give...  
Me up

'Cause what about, what about angels?  
They will come, they will go, make us special

It's not about not about angels, angels
