### At My Best歌词：

I wrote this song as a message for help  
On behalf of anybody finding theirself  
I wrote this letter to numb your pain  
'Cause everyday I wake up I'm feeling the same  
I got issues just like you got issues  
I been hurt I seen the scar tissue  
If I show you would you run away  
Do I gotta hide 'em for you to wanna stay  
Do I, even need you, should I leave you  
Do I, gotta be you, just to please you  
Do I, say I'm all good, when I bleed you  
Through my, heart, quit tearing mine apart  
I shout, I swear, I get angry, I get scared  
I fall, I break, I mess up, I make mistakes  
But if you can't take me at my worst  
You don't deserve me at my best  
Got to keep it going, got to keep my head up, uh  
Got to keep it going, got to keep my head up, uh  
Got to keep it going, got to keep my head up cause life is about, aight check
this out  
Life is about making mistakes  
It's also about trying to be great  
Do not let failure scare you away  
I know you fed up, you fall, get up  
It's all in us, I can speak about 'cause I did it (true)  
Ladies and gentlemen here's the exhibit  
It's my life look a little closer you could see the highlight  
Gold ain't always golden but I told 'em  
Look at all the years I've been waiting for a moment  
Shed a lot of tears just to smile in the morning  
Tell me could you love me, tell me could you love me  
Tell me could you love me if I told you why  
I shout, I swear, I get angry, I get scared  
I fall, I break, I mess up, I make mistakes  
But if you can't take me at my worst  
You don't deserve me at my best  
This song's for anybody, yeah  
Who feels like I did  
Never the cool kid  
This song's for anybody  
Who fought their way through  
Always remain true  
This song's for anybody  
The one's who trying to get it  
The one's who dreaming and live it  
This song's for anybody  
This song, this song, this song, this song, this song, this song  
I shout, I swear, I get angry, I get scared  
I fall, I break, I mess up, I make mistakes  
But if you can't take me at my worst  
You don't deserve me at my best  
Got to keep it going, got to keep my head up, uh  
Got to keep it going, got to keep my head up, uh  
Got to keep it going, got to keep my head up cause life is about
