### Wait歌词：

Dirty looks from your mother  
Never seen you in a dress that color no  
It's a special occasion  
Not invited but I'm glad I made it oh  
Let me apologize  
I'll make up make up make up make up for all those times  
Your love I don't wanna lose  
I'm beggin' beggin' beggin' beggin' I'm beggin' you  
Wait can you turn around can you turn around  
Just wait can we work this out can we work this out  
Just wait can you come here please 'cause I wanna be with you  
Wait can you turn around can you turn around  
Just wait can we work this out can we work this out  
Just wait could you come here please 'cause I wanna be with you  
Can we talk for a moment  
Got these feelings that I'm tired of holding on  
Wasn't tryna get wasted  
I needed more than three or four to say this oh  
Let me apologize yeah  
I'll make up make up make up make up for all those times all those times  
Your love I don't wanna lose  
I'm beggin' beggin' beggin' beggin' I'm begging you  
Wait can you turn around can you turn around  
Just wait can we work this out can we work this out  
Just wait can you come here please 'cause I wanna be with you  
Wait can you turn around can you turn around  
Just wait can we work this out can we work this out  
Just wait could you come here please 'cause I wanna be with you  
Wait can we work this out I've been thinkin' out loud all day  
Don't let me down can't live without my bae  
And she wanna leave but I think it's easier  
If you let me be you should come and see me girl  
Just think about it girl you should know I still think about you yeah  
I know you're into diamonds I can tell you everything defined in you  
But I'm like  
Wait can you turn around can you turn around  
Just wait can we work this out can we work this out  
Just wait can you come here please 'cause I wanna be with you  
Wait can you turn around can you turn around  
Just wait can we work this out can we work this out  
Just wait could you come here please 'cause I wanna be with you
