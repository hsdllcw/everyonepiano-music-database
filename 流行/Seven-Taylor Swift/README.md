**Seven** 是美国女歌手Taylor Swift演唱的歌曲，收录在其第八张录音室专辑《Folklore》中。为其所属专辑中的第7首歌曲。

歌曲没有亢长的前奏，只有简单的钢琴声，可Taylor一开口就可以听出歌中地老天荒的感情。她的女中音呢喃诉说着故事中七岁那场邂逅。树荫下的少男少女，无忧无虑的喝着甜茶，与同伴嬉戏玩闹。可惜一切美好都有结束之时，时光终究冲散了年少时的缘分。曲子最后接近一分钟的凄美弦乐，似乎是照应了歌词“our
love will be passed
on”——无论结局如何，我们的爱流芳百世。故事到了最后，虽然遗憾，但那个他始终在记忆里游荡，也不至于望月长叹、深陷深蓝漩涡。

### Seven歌词：

Please picture me in the trees  
I hit my peak at seven  
Feet in the swing over the creek  
I was too scared to jump in but I I was high  
In the sky  
With Pennsylvania under me  
Are there still beautiful things  
Sweet tea in the summer  
Cross your heart won't tell no other  
And though I can't recall your face  
I still got love for you  
Your braids like a pattern  
Love you to the moon and to Saturn  
Passed down like folk songs  
The love lasts so long  
And I've been meaning to tell you I think your house is haunted  
Your dad is always mad and that must be why  
And I think you should come live with me and we can be pirates  
Then you won't have to cry or hide in the closet  
And just like a folk song  
Our love will be passed on  
Please picture me in the weeds  
Before I learned civility I used to scream ferociously  
Any time I wanted  
Sweet tea in the summer  
Cross my heart won't tell no other  
And though I can't recall your face I still got love for you  
Pack your dolls and a sweater  
We'll move to India forever  
Passed down like folk songs  
Our love lasts so long
