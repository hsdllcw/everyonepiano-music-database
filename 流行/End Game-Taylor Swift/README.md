### End Game歌词：

Taylor Swift：  
I wanna be your end game  
I wanna be your first string  
I wanna be your A-Team  
Woah woah woah  
I wanna be your end game end game  
Taylor Swift/Future：  
Big reputation big reputation  
Ooh you and me we got big reputations  
Ah and you heard about me  
Oh I got some big enemies  
Yeah  
Big reputation big reputation  
Ooh you and me would be a big conversation  
Ah and I heard about you  
Ooh you like the bad ones too  
Future：  
You so d**e don't overdose  
I'm so stoked I need a toast  
We do the most I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin' a boat  
I got a reputation girl that don't precede me yah  
I'm a call away whenever you need me yeah  
I'm in a G5 yeah come to the A-Side yeah  
I got a bad boy persona that's what they like  
What they like  
You love it I love it too 'cause you my type  
You my type  
You hold me down and I protect you with my life  
Taylor Swift/Future：  
I don't wanna touch you I don't wanna be  
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see  
I don't wanna miss you  
I don't wanna miss you  
Like the other girls do  
I don't wanna hurt you I just wanna be  
Drinking on a beach with you all over me  
I know what they all say  
I know what they all say  
But I ain't tryna play  
Taylor Swift：  
I wanna be your end game  
I wanna be your first string  
I wanna be your A-Team  
I wanna be your end game end game  
Ed Sheeran：  
Now well when I was young we connected  
When we were little bit older both sprung  
I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders  
Reputation precedes me and rumors are knee-deep  
The truth is it's easier to ignore it believe me  
Even when we'd argue we'd not do it for long  
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song  
For all your beautiful traits and the way you do it with ease  
For all my flaws paranoia and insecurities  
I've made mistakes and made some choices that's hard to deny  
After the storm something was born on the 4th of July  
I've passed days without fun this end game is the one  
With four words on the tip of my tongue I'll never say it  
Taylor Swift/Ed Sheeran：  
I don't wanna touch you I don't wanna be  
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see  
I don't wanna miss you like the other girls do  
I don't wanna hurt you I just wanna be  
Drinking on a beach with you all over me  
I know what they all say yeah but I ain't tryna play  
Taylor Swift：  
I wanna be your end game  
I wanna be your first string  
I wanna be your A-Team  
I wanna be your end game end game  
Taylor Swift/Future：  
Big reputation big reputation  
Ooh you and me we got big reputations  
Ah and you heard about me  
Oh I got some big enemies  
Hey big reputation big reputation  
Ooh you and me would be a big conversation  
Ah and I heard about you  
Ooh you like the bad ones too  
Taylor Swift：  
I hit you like bang  
We tried to forget it but we just couldn't  
And I bury hatchets but I keep maps of where I put 'em  
Reputation precedes me they told you I'm crazy  
I swear I don't love the drama it loves me  
And I can't let you go your hand prints on my soul  
It's like your eyes are liquor it's like your body is gold  
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks  
So here's a truth from my red lips  
Both：  
I wanna be your end game  
I wanna be your first string  
Me and you  
I wanna be your A-Team  
Be your A-Team  
I wanna be your end game end game  
I wanna be your end game  
I wanna be your first string  
I wanna be your A-Team  
I wanna be your end game end game
