### Murder on my Mind歌词：

Get to roll no  
Ayy I'm in the studio bro  
Oh nah yeah call me ball me  
Yeah I'll bet  
Yeah I'm at the studio hold up though  
I ain't get to roll no w**d  
I ain't get to roll no Swishers  
I was locked up on Christmas  
Ain't get to see my n***as  
Ain't get to hug my mama couldn't even give her no kisses  
Can't even post on my Instagram  
'Cause these p***y n***as be snitching  
Everybody acting suspicious  
Might probably say that I'm tripping  
When I'm all alone in my jail cell  
I tend to get in my feelings  
And all I smoke is that loud don't pass me no midget  
And I'ma smoke all of my pain away  
'Cause that's the only thing that gon' heal it  
I don't understand these women who go around pretending  
As if they really f**k with me  
So I love 'em all from a distance  
'Cause the same b***h say she down to  
Ride be the main one who tricking  
Got Molly mixed with promethazine 'cause every time  
I wake up in the morning  
I got murder on my mind  
AK-47's MAC-11 Glocks and nines  
And all these p***y n***as hating  
Tryna knock me off my grind  
But I can't let 'em do it  
I got murder on my mind  
B***h I got murder on my mind  
B***h I got murder on my mind  
I got murder on my mind  
On my mind  
I got murder on my mind  
I got murder on my mind  
I got murder on my mind  
I got murder on my mind  
Yellow tape around his body it's a f**king homicide  
His face is on a T-shirt and his family traumatized  
I didn't even mean to shoot him he just caught me by surprise  
I reloaded my pistol cocked it back and shot him twice  
His body dropped down to the floor  
And he got teardrops in his eyes  
He grabbed me by my hands and said he was afraid to die  
I told him it's too late my friend  
It's time to say goodbye  
And he died inside my arms blood all on my shirt  
Wake up in the morning  
I got murder on my mind  
AK-47's MAC-11 Glocks and nines  
And all these p***y n***as hating  
Tryna knock me off my grind  
But I can't let 'em do it  
I got murder on my mind  
B***h I got murder on my mind  
B***h I got murder on my mind  
I got murder on my mind  
On my mind  
I got murder on my mind  
I got murder on my mind  
I got murder on my mind  
I got murder on my mind  
Bite like tarantula b***h I'm an animal  
Melly's a savage no he not no amateur  
Bad b***h named Angela f**ked her on camera  
B***h I'm a murderer  
Yeah yeah  
I might just kill the boy don't wanna kill the boy  
Bake him up say he want beef we gon' grill the boy  
Grill the boy  
I'm bleeding so good  
I might dip his a*s in it and spill the boy  
Haha murder on my mind whoa whoa  
I got murder on my mind  
On my mind  
I got murder on my mind  
I got murder on my mind huh  
Wake up in the morning  
I got murder on my mind  
AK-47's MAC-11 Glocks and nines  
And all these p***y n***as hating  
Tryna knock me off my grind  
But I can't let 'em do it  
I got murder on my mind  
B***h I got murder on my mind
