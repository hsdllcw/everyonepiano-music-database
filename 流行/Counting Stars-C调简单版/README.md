《 **Counting Stars**
》是美国流行摇滚乐队OneRepublic发行的单曲，是乐团商业成绩最好的一首歌曲，在加拿大和英国取得了排行榜冠军，在美国则取得了亚军，在20个国家都进入了榜单前10。歌曲在英国已获得了超过100万份销量。

歌曲是Ryan
Tedder一次新鲜大胆的尝试。在木吉他的伴奏下，他以慵懒缠绵的嗓音唱着“最近我总是辗转反侧，难以入眠”，如同失眠者呓语。突然音乐节奏转快，鼓和贝司欢快加入，歌词也配合节奏快速流动，“生活就像一株跃动的藤蔓，长驱直入激活我的内心，在我脸上划过痕迹”。无论旋律、节奏还是歌词，这都是一首朗朗上口、明快轻松的歌，配合歌词里的“我坚信这个世界美好如初”，扫除了年轻人的迷茫不安，注入昂扬能量。

### Counting Stars歌词：

Lately I've been I've been losing sleep  
Dreaming about the things that we could be  
But baby I've been I've been praying hard  
Said no more counting dollars  
We'll be counting stars  
Yeah we'll be counting stars  
I see this life like a swinging vine  
Swing my heart across the line  
In my face is flashing signs  
Seek it out and ye' shall find  
Old but I'm not that old  
Young but I'm not that bold  
And I don't think the world is sold  
On just doing what we're told  
I I I I feel something so right  
Doing the wrong thing  
I I I I feel something so wrong  
Doing the right thing  
I couldn't lie couldn't lie couldn't lie  
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive  
Lately I've been I've been losing sleep  
Dreaming about the things that we could be  
But baby I've been I've been praying hard  
Said no more counting dollars  
We'll be counting stars  
Lately I've been I've been losing sleep  
Dreaming about the things that we could be  
But baby I've been I've been praying hard  
Said no more counting dollars  
We'll be we'll be counting stars  
I feel the love and I feel it burn  
Down this river every turn  
Hope is our four-letter word  
Make that money watch it burn  
Old but I'm not that old  
Young but I'm not that bold  
And I don't think the world is sold  
On just doing what we're told  
I I I I feel something so wrong  
Doing the right thing  
I couldn't lie couldn't lie couldn't lie  
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly  
Lately I've been I've been losing sleep  
Dreaming about the things that we could be  
But baby I've been I've been praying hard  
Said no more counting dollars  
We'll be counting stars  
Lately I've been I've been losing sleep  
Dreaming about the things that we could be  
But baby I've been I've been praying hard  
Said no more counting dollars  
We'll be we'll be counting stars  
Take that money  
Watch it burn  
Sink in the river  
The lessons I've learned  
Take that money  
Watch it burn  
Sink in the river  
The lessons I've learned  
Take that money  
Watch it burn  
Sink in the river  
The lessons I've learned  
Take that money  
Watch it burn  
Sink in the river  
The lessons I've learned  
Everything that kills me  
Makes me feel alive  
Lately I've been I've been losing sleep  
Dreaming about the things that we could be  
But baby I've been I've been praying hard  
Said no more counting dollars  
We'll be counting stars  
Lately I've been I've been losing sleep  
Dreaming about the things that we could be  
But baby I've been I've been praying hard  
Said no more counting dollars  
We'll be we'll be counting stars  
Take that money  
Watch it burn  
Sink in the river  
The lessons I've learned  
Take that money  
Watch it burn  
Sink in the river  
The lessons I've learned  
Take that money  
Watch it burn  
Sink in the river  
The lessons I've learned  
Take that money  
Watch it burn  
Sink in the river  
The lessons I've learned
