Alan Walker联手Salem Ilese于2021年2月19日推出了新歌《 **Fake a Smile** 》。

与此前的《On My Way》等歌曲富有力量感的女声不同，这次的Salem Ilese的女声比较柔和；Alan的旋律也一反之前《The
Spectre》等大量歌曲的高亢旋律，变得更加优美了，由一种力量感改为柔中带坚，和今年上一首《[ **Sorry**](Music-12754-Sorry-
Alan-Walker-ft-ISAK.html "Sorry")》有同样的感觉。

### Fake A Smile歌词：

You and I up all night  
Nothing's wrong nothing's right  
I swear these walls are upside down  
Swear the roof is underground  
Demons don't sleep at night  
Oh oh oh  
I try to turn off my mind  
Say I'm doing just fine  
But I'm screaming inside like  
Ohhh  
Say these words on repeat  
While I'm trying to breathe  
Now you're counting on me  
So I fake a smile  
But I know you know me too well  
But it's alright  
You're like heaven when I'm in hell  
You were there held me hard  
Tasted light but felt the dark  
I'm waiting for them all to see  
I don't deserve your company  
To love myself is way too hard  
Oh oh oh  
I try to turn off my mind  
Say I'm doing just fine  
But I'm screaming inside like  
Ohhh  
Say these words on repeat  
While I'm trying to breathe  
Now you're counting on me  
So I fake a smile  
But I know you know me too well  
But it's alright  
You're like heaven when I'm in hell  
No sleep  
But it's alright  
No sleep  
So I fake a smile  
But I know you know me too well  
But it's alright  
You're like heaven when I'm in hell  
So I fake a smile  
But I know you know me too well  
But it's alright  
You're like heaven when I'm in hell  
So I fake a smile  
But I know you know me too well  
But it's alright  
You're like heaven when I'm in hell
