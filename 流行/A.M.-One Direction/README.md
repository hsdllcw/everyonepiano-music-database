### A.M.歌词：

Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?  
All my favourite conversations  
Always made in the A.M. (yeah yeah)

Feels like this could be forever tonight  
Break these clocks, forget about time  
There could be a World War 3 goin' on outside  
You and me were raised in the same part of town  
Got these scars on the same ground  
Remember how we used to kick around just wasting time?

Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?  
All my favourite conversations  
Always made in the A.M.  
Cause we don't know what we're saying  
We're just swimming round in our glasses  
And talking out of our asses  
Like we're all gonna make it (yeah, yeah)

Feels like this could be forever right now  
Don't wanna sleep cause we're dreaming out loud  
Trying to behave but you know that we never learned, how  
You and me were raised in the same part of town  
Got these scars on the same ground  
Remember how we used to kick around just wasting time?

Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?  
All my favourite conversations  
Always made in the A.M.  
Cause we don't know what we're saying  
We're just swimming round in our glasses  
And talking out of our asses  
Like we're all gonna make it (yeah, yeah)

You know I'm always coming back to this place  
You know  
And I'll say  
You know I'm always gonna look for your face  
You know

Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?  
All my favourite conversations  
Always made in the A.M.  
Cause we don't know what we're saying  
We're just swimming round in our glasses  
And talking out of our asses  
Like we're all gonna make it (yeah, yeah)

Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?  
You know I'm always coming back to this place  
Won't you stay 'til the A.M.? (yeah, yeah)  
You know  
Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?  
You know I'm always gonna look for your face  
Won't you stay 'til the A.M.? (yeah, yeah)
