**Me, Myself & I**是美国说唱歌手G-Eazy和女歌手Bebe
Rexha合作的歌曲，词曲由格拉德•吉伦、迈克尔•基南、克里斯托弗•安德森和布莱塔•雷克萨谱写。歌曲被收录在G-Eazy第二张录音室专辑《When It's
Dark Out》，于2015年10月15日作为该专辑的首支单曲发行。

《 _Me, Myself & I_》描写的是G-
Eazy庆祝私人空间以及独处的生活。对此他表示，在整天都在做与音乐相关的事情的情况下，他认为自己需要找到独处的时间，因而写下了这首歌曲。而对于此次合作的歌手Bebe
Rexha他解释道，他们是通过一个共同的朋友而认识的。他们在这位朋友的住处会面。交谈时Bebe
Rexha播放了一首简单的Demo，在听到之后他认为内容正好与他当时所想的产生了联系，于是之后二人将这个Demo作为主轴谱写编排了歌曲的其余部分。

整首歌曲向听众展示了其混合的风格。G-Eazy的说唱与Bebe
Rexha罂粟般的声音搭配在了一起，听起来像是一首采取了埃米纳姆和蕾哈娜合作方式的流行乐。Bebe
Rexha提升了整首歌曲的水准，而歌曲的其余部分则不言而喻。同时G-Eazy在整首作品中表明了自身想要应付枯燥现实的内心想法。

### Me, Myself & I歌词：

[Bebe Rexha (G-Eazy):]  
Oh, it's just me, myself and I  
Solo ride until I die  
'Cause I got me for life  
(yeah)  
Oh I don't need a hand to hold  
Even when the night is cold  
I got that fire in my soul

[G-Eazy:]  
And as far as I can see I just need privacy  
Plus a whole lot of tree, fuck all this modesty  
I just need space to do me get a world that they're tryna see  
A Stella Maxwell right beside of me  
A Ferrari I'm buyin' three  
A closet of Saint Laurent, get what I want when I want  
'Cause this hunger is driving me, yeah  
I just need to be alone, I just need to be at home  
Understand what I'm speaking on if time is money I need a loan  
But regardless I'll always keep keepin' on  
Fuck fake friends, we don't take L's we just make M's  
While y'all follow, we just make trends  
I'm right back to work when that break ends

[Bebe Rexha (G-Eazy):]  
Oh, it's just me, myself and I  
Solo ride until I die  
'Cause I got me for life  
(Got me for life, yeah)  
Oh I don't need a hand to hold  
Even when the night is cold  
I got that fire in my soul

[Bebe Rexha (G-Eazy):]  
I don't need anything to get me through the night  
Except the beat that's in my heart  
Yeah, it's keeping me alive  
(Keeps me alive)  
I don't need anything to make me satisfied (you know)  
'Cause the music does me good and it gets me every time

[G-Eazy:]  
Yeah, and I don't like talking to strangers  
So get the fuck off me I'm anxious  
I'm tryna be cool but I may just go ape shit  
Say "fuck y'all" to all of y'all faces  
It changes though now that I'm famous  
Everyone knows how this lifestyle is dangerous  
But I love it the rush is amazing  
Celebrate nightly and everyone rages  
I found how to cope with my anger  
I'm swimming in money  
Swimming in liquor my liver is muddy  
But it's all good I'm still sippin' this bubbly  
This shit is lovely, this shit ain't random, I didn't get lucky  
Made it right here 'cause I'm sick with it Cudi  
They all take the money for granted  
But don't want to work for it tell me now, isn't it funny? Nah

[Bebe Rexha (G-Eazy):]  
Oh, it's just me, myself and I  
Solo ride until I die  
'Cause I got me for life  
(Got me for life, yeah)  
Oh I don't need a hand to hold  
Even when the night is cold  
I got that fire in my soul

[Bebe Rexha (G-Eazy):]  
I don't need anything to get me through the night  
Except the beat that's in my heart  
Yeah, it's keeping me alive  
(Keeps me alive)  
I don't need anything to make me satisfied (you know)  
'Cause the music does me good and it gets me every time

[Bebe Rexha (G-Eazy):]  
Like ba-ba-ba-ba-da-ba  
Ba-ba-ba-da-ba (Yee!)  
Ba-ba-ba-ba-da-ba  
Ba-ba-ba-da-ba  
Ba-ba-ba-ba-da-ba  
Ba-ba-ba-da-ba  
'Cause the music does me good and it gets me every time

[G-Eazy:]  
Yeah, lonely nights I laid awake  
Pray to lord, my soul to take  
My heart's become too cold to break  
Know I'm great but I'm broke as hell  
Having dreams that I'm folding cake  
All my life I've been told to wait  
But I'mma get it now, yeah it's no debate  
Yeah

[Bebe Rexha (G-Eazy):]  
Oh, it's just me, myself and I  
Solo ride until I die  
'Cause I got me for life  
(Got me for life, yeah)  
Oh I don't need a hand to hold  
Even when the night is cold  
I got that fire in my soul

[Bebe Rexha (G-Eazy):]  
I don't need anything to get me through the night  
Except the beat that's in my heart  
Yeah, it's keeping me alive  
(Keeps me alive)  
I don't need anything to make me satisfied (you know)  
'Cause the music does me good and it gets me every time

[Bebe Rexha:]  
Like ba-ba-ba-ba-da-ba  
Ba-ba-ba-da-ba  
Ba-ba-ba-ba-da-ba
