### Ex's & Oh's歌词：

Well, I had me a boy, turned him into a man  
I showed him all the things that he didn't understand  
Whoa, and then I let him go

Now, there's one in California who's been cursing my name  
'Cause I found me a better lover in the UK  
Hey, hey, until I made my getaway

One, two, three, they gonna run back to me  
'Cause I'm the best baby that they never gotta keep  
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me  
They always wanna come, but they never wanna leave

Ex's and the oh, oh, oh's they haunt me  
Like gho-o-osts they want me to make 'em all  
They won't let go  
Ex's and oh's

I had a summer lover down in New Orleans  
Kept him warm in the winter, left him frozen in the spring  
My, my, how the seasons go by

I get high, and I love to get low  
So the hearts keep breaking, and the heads just roll  
You know that's how the story goes

One, two, three, they gonna run back to me  
'Cause I'm the best baby that they never gotta keep  
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me  
They always wanna come, but they never wanna leave

Ex's and the oh, oh, oh's they haunt me  
Like gho-o-osts they want me to make 'em all  
They won't let go

My ex's and the oh, oh, oh's they haunt me  
Like gho-o-osts they want me to make 'em all  
They won't let go  
Ex's and oh's

One, two, three, they gonna run back to me  
Climbing over mountains and a-sailing over seas  
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me  
They always wanna come, but they never wanna leave

My ex's and the oh, oh, oh's they haunt me  
Like gho-o-osts they want me to make 'em all  
They won't let go

Ex's and the oh, oh, oh's they haunt me  
Like gho-o-osts they want me to make 'em all  
They won't let go  
Ex's and oh's
