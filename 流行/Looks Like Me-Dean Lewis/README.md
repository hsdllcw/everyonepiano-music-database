### Looks Like Me歌词：

You've been working ten hours  
And your feet are still aching  
You tell your friends to come over  
To forget about your problems  
You say you talked to somebody  
He even looks like me  
Oh baby, why do you say things  
That make me believe?  
That you're sorry, you're sorry  
But you're not sorry at all  
I wonder how could it hurt you  
You've got no feelings involved  
And then I tell you I want you  
And you say nothing at all  
You say nothing at all  
'Cause I need someone who loves me  
And I know it don't come easily  
And maybe I'm just not good enough at all to feel your love  
So how am I supposed to let go  
When you won't let me let go  
And maybe I'm just not good enough at all to feel your love  
And now I'm walking down Sunset  
With my feelings on repeat  
I wonder what you've been thinking?  
Oh, are you thinking about me?  
Then you say that you love me  
But you don't love me at all  
I wonder how could it hurt you  
You've got no feelings involved  
And then I tell you I want you  
And you say nothing at all  
And you say nothing at all  
'Cause I need someone who loves me  
And I know it don't come easily  
And maybe I'm just not good enough at all to feel your love  
So how am I supposed to let go  
When you won't let me let go  
And maybe I'm just not good enough at all to feel your love  
(To feel your love)  
You said "Hey, I just wanna hear your voice"  
I said "Babe, you know that this was your choice"  
You said "Hey, I just wanna hear your voice"  
I said "Babe, you know that this was your choice"  
But it means nothing at all  
'Cause I need someone who loves me  
And I know it don't come easily  
And maybe I'm just not good enough at all to feel your love  
So how am I supposed to let go  
When you won't let me let go  
And maybe I'm just not good enough at all to feel your love  
To feel your love  
To feel your love  
And maybe I'm just not good enough at all to feel your love  
To feel your love  
To feel your love  
To feel your love
