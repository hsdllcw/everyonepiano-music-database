### Me, Myself & I歌词：

I guess, I guess I got what I wanted  
I never knew what I needed, leave it  
Up to me to fuck it up without a good reason  
I know, I know that it was my own fault  
I never picked up that phone call, oh, Lord  
All these broke hearts but mine's the one bleedin'  
Bullshit, I feed myself  
Me and my selfish appetite  
I did not need your help  
Now it's just me, myself and I  
La-la-lie, la-la-lie, la-lie-lie  
Now it's just me, myself and I  
La-la-lie, la-la-lie, la-lie-lie  
Now it's just me, myself and I  
I guess, I guess I got what I wanted  
I never knew what I needed, leave it  
Up to me to fuck it up without a good reason  
I know, I know that it was my own fault  
I never picked up that phone call, oh, Lord  
All these broke hearts but mine's the one bleedin'  
Bullshit, I feed myself  
Me and my selfish appetite  
I did not need your help  
Now it's just me, myself and I  
La-la-lie, la-la-lie, la-lie-lie  
Now it's just me, myself and I  
La-la-lie, la-la-lie, la-lie-lie  
Now it's just me, myself and I  
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh  
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh  
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh  
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh  
I guess, I guess I got what I wanted  
I never knew what I needed, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Bullshit, I feed myself  
Me and my selfish appetite  
I did not need your help  
Now it's just me, myself and I  
I know you wish me well  
And that's what makes me wanna die  
I did not need your help  
Now it's just me, myself and I  
La-la-lie, la-la-lie, la-lie-lie  
Now it's just me, myself and I  
La-la-lie, la-la-lie, la-lie-lie  
Now it's just me, myself and  
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (Now it's just me, myself and, self and)  
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (Now it's just me, myself and,
self and I)  
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (Now it's just me, myself and)  
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (Now it's just me, myself and)
