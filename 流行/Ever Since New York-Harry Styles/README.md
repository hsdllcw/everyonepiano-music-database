### Ever Since New York歌词：

Tell me something, tell me something  
You don't know nothing, just pretend you do  
I need something, tell me something new  
Choose your words 'cause there's no antidote  
For this curse. Oh, what's it waiting for?  
Must this hurt you just before you go?  
Oh, tell me something I don't already know  
Oh, tell me something I don't already know  
Brooklyn saw me, empty at the news  
There's no water inside this swimming pool  
Almost over, had enough from you  
And I've been praying, I never did before  
Understand I'm talking to the walls  
I've been praying ever since New York  
Oh, tell me something I don't already know  
Oh, tell me something I don't already know  
Oh, tell me something I don't already know  
Oh, tell me something I don't already know  
Tell me something, tell me something  
You don't know nothing, just pretend you do  
Tell me something just before you go  
Oh, tell me something I don't already know  
Oh, tell me something I don't already know  
Oh, tell me something I don't already know  
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
