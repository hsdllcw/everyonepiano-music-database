### Secrets歌词：

I've got bipolar disorder  
my shits not in order  
I'm overweight  
I'm always late  
I've got too many things to say  
I rock mom jeans  
cat earrings  
extrapolate my feelings  
my family is dysfunctional  
but we have a good time killing each other  
They tell us from the time were young  
to hide the things that we don't like about ourselves  
inside ourselves  
I know I'm not the only one who spent so long  
attempting to be someone else  
well I'm over it  
I don't care if the world know what my secrets are, secrets are  
I don't care if the world knows what my secrets are, secrets are  
so what  
so what  
so what  
so what  
I can't think straight  
I'm so gay  
sometimes I cry  
a whole day  
I care a lot  
use an analog clock  
And never know when to stop  
and I'm passive agressive  
I'm scared of the dark and the dentist  
I love my butt, and won't gonna shut up  
and I never really grew up  
They tell us from the time were young  
to hide the things that we don't like about ourselves  
inside ourselves  
I know I'm not the only one  
who spent so long attempting to be someone else  
well I'm over it  
I don't care if the world know what my secrets are, secrets are  
I don't care if the world knows what my secrets are, secrets are  
so what  
so what  
so what  
so what  
I don't care if the world know what my secrets are, secrets are  
I don't care if the world knows what my secrets are, secrets are  
so what  
so what  
so what  
so what  
so what  
so what
