Spots演唱。The Ink Spots，中文墨水点乐队，在黑人重唱风格的初创期起到了长远的作用，他们为五十年代doo-
wop的腾飞铺平了道路，比尔•肯尼的男高音颤音招致了无数street-corner
leads的来临，还有甜美的和声查理•福卡、迪克沃森、低音和声霍比•琼斯（逝于1944）等人的无限支持。

### I Don't Want To Set The World On Fire歌词：

I don't want to set the world on fire  
I just want to start  
A flame in your heart  
In my heart I have but one desire  
And that one is you  
No other will do  
I've lost all ambition for worldly acclaim  
I just want to be the one you love  
And with your admission that you feel the same  
I'll have reached the goal I'm dreaming of  
Believe me  
I don't want to set the world on fire  
I just want to start  
A flame in your heart  
I don't wanna set the world on fire honey  
I love ya too much  
I just wanna start a big big flame  
Down in your heart  
You see  
Way down inside of me  
Darlin' I have one desire  
And that one desire is you  
And I know nobody else ain't gonna do  
I've lost all ambition for wordly acclaim  
I just want to be the one you love  
And with your admission that you feel the same  
I'll have reached the goal I'm dreaming of  
Believe me  
I don't want to set the world on fire  
I just want to start  
A flame in your heart
