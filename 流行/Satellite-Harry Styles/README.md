《 **Satellite** 》是英国歌手Harry Styles演唱的歌曲，收录在其第三张录音室专辑《Harry's House》中。

这张专辑结合了复古民谣摇滚与迪斯科元素，让人感觉轻松惬意的同时，也标志着 Harry进一步向成熟的唱作歌手转型。

比如在《 _Satellite_
》这首歌中，Styles就将自己比作卫星，而环绕的正是心之所向，仿佛是一封情书，而爱意流淌于琴键之间，让人感受到了演唱者的情感，那些私人的不可言说的情感都在他的浅唱低吟中，跟演唱者产生强烈的情感共鸣，跟他一起坠入爱河，跟他一起惋惜心碎。

### Satellite歌词：

You got a new life  
Am I bothering you  
Do you wanna talk  
We share the last line  
Then we drink the wall  
Until we wanna talk  
I go round and round  
Satellite  
Spinning out waiting for you to pull me in  
I can see you're lonely down there  
Don't you know that I am right here  
Spinning out waiting for you to pull me in  
I can see you're lonely down there  
Don't you know that I am right here  
I'm in an LA Mood  
I don't wanna talk to you  
She said Give me a day or two  
I go round and round  
Satellite  
Spinning out waiting for you to pull me in  
I can see you're lonely down there  
Don't you know that I am right here  
Spinning out waiting for you to pull me in  
I can see you're lonely down there  
Don't you know that I am right here  
Right here  
Right here  
Spinning out waiting for you  
I'm here  
Right here  
Wishing I could be there for you  
Be there for you  
Be there for you for you  
Spinning out waiting for you to pull me in  
I can see you're lonely down there  
Don't you know that I am right here  
Spinning out waiting for you to pull me in  
I can see you're lonely down there  
Don't you know that I am right here  
Spinning out waiting for you to pull me in  
I can see you're lonely down there  
Don't you know that I am right here
