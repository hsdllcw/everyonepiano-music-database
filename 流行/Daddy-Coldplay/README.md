**Daddy双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Daddy_ 由 Coldplay 演唱，收录于专辑《Everyday
Life》中。这首歌没有以往的恢弘气势，更多的是真挚的情感，而泪却恰恰落在了开头的心跳声，触动心弦的声音很沉重。开头的钢琴前奏很温柔，能把那种淡淡的忧伤的情绪带入。戳心的歌词和温暖的旋律，接近呢喃细语式的唱法，轻柔而略带沙哑的嗓音浅浅的诉说着对父亲的想念，把故事一一讲给你听。听的时候内心壮阔波澜，实属冬日暖心之作。

歌曲MV讲述了小女孩在大海中寻找父亲的故事，一路的困境终在最后牵手成功。唯美的画面真挚的情感实在是让人泪目。风筝线会断，乌鸦会飞走，木船会翻，没有谁会一路陪伴，愿所有的美好接踵而至。

### Daddy歌词：

Daddy are you out there  
Daddy won't you come and play  
Daddy do you not care  
Is there nothing that you want to say  
I know you're hurting too  
But I need you I do  
Daddy if you're out there  
Daddy all I want to say  
You're so far away  
Oh and you're so far away  
But that's ok that's ok I'm ok  
Daddy are you out there  
Daddy why'd you run away  
Daddy are you ok  
Look dad we got the same hair  
Daddy it's my birthday  
All I want to say  
If you're so far away  
Oh and you're so far away  
But that's ok it's ok it's ok  
You're so far away  
Won't you come home won't you stay  
Please stay please stay  
Won't you come home won't you stay  
One day just one day
