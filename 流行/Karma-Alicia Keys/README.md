**Karma** 是美国女歌手、音乐人Alicia Keys所演唱的一首歌曲。Alicia
Keys略带沙哑的嗓音和复古的曲风充分展现了她成熟超龄的声音表现与歌词笔触，她自己包办所有创作的专辑，娴熟掌控灵魂、节奏蓝调、爵士、放克与嘻哈等多元曲风的编曲功力更是教人刮目相看。她巧妙地将黑人传统灵歌与现代节奏、爵士与流行旋律以及创作人的创作灵感结合在一起，运用她那透露着性感和磁性的诱人声线，传递着迷人的灵动气息，形成了一种独特的韵味。

另外， _Karma_ 此曲收录在专辑The Diary of Alicia Keys中。专辑中，除了优美的音乐之外，更多的表现出了Alicia
Keys的成熟以及丰富细腻的感情，专辑中或描绘出了一个年轻女人的复杂而曲折的爱情，或流露了一个少女对于音乐所拥有的浪漫和梦想。

### Karma歌词：

Weren't you the one who said that you don't want me anymore  
And how you need your space and give the keys back to your door  
And how I cried and tried and tried to make you stay with me  
And still you said your love was gone and that I had to leave  
Now you're Talking bout a family  
Now you're saying I complete your dreams  
Oh  
Now you're sayin I'm your everything  
You're confusing me  
What you saying to me, don't play wit me, don't play wit me  
Cause....  
[Chorus:]  
What goes around comes around  
What goes up must come down  
Now who's cryin', desirin' to come back to me  
What goes around comes around  
What goes up must come down  
Now who's cryin, desirin', to come back  
I remember when I was sittin home alone  
Waitin for you til 3 o'clock in the 'morn  
And when you came home you'd always have some sorry excuse  
Half explaining to me like I'm just some kind of a fool  
I sacrificed the things I wanted just to do things for you  
But when it's time to do for me  
You never come thru  
Now you wanna be up under me  
Now you have so much to say to me  
Now you wanna make time for me  
Whatcha doin to me, you're confusin me  
Don't play with me don't play with me cause  
[Repeat Chorus 2x]  
I remember when I was sittin home alone  
Waitin for you till 3 o'clock in the 'morn  
Night after night knowing something goin on  
Wasn't long before I be gone  
Lord knows it wasn't easy believe me  
Never thought you'd be the one that would deceive me  
And never do what you're supposed to do  
No need to approach me fool, cuz I'm over you  
[Repeat Chorus]  
Gotta stop trying to come back to me  
[Repeat Chorus]  
It's called Karma baby and it goes around
