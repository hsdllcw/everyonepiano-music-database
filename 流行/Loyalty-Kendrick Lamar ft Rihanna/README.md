### Loyalty歌词：

I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up  
Fired fire  
All I want tonight just get high up  
High high  
Girl you look so good it's to die for  
Die for  
Ooh that pussy good it's to die for  
On fire  
It's a secret society all we ask is trust  
All we ask is trust  
All we got is us  
Loyalty loyalty loyalty  
Loyalty loyalty loyalty  
Kung Fu Kenny now  
My resume is real enough for two millenniums  
A better way to make a wave's not defendin' them  
I meditate and moderate all of my wins again  
I'm hangin' on the fence again  
I'm always on your mind  
I put my lyric and my lifeline on the line  
And ain't no limit when I might shine might grind  
You rollin' with it at the right time right now  
Only for the dollar sign  
Bad gyal RiRi now  
Swerve swerve swerve swerve deeper now  
On your pulse like a CD in  
Gas in the bitch like it's premium  
Haul ass on a bitch all in the fast lane  
Been a bad bitch way before any cash came  
I'm established  
Hundred carats on my name run the atlas  
I'm a natural I'm alright  
I'm a savage I'm an asshole I'm a king  
Shimmy yeah shimmy yeah shimmy yeah rock  
You can tell your nigga he can meet me outside  
Yeah  
You can babysit him when I leave him outside  
Ain't no other love like the one I know  
I done been down so long I slowed  
I done came down so hard I slowed  
I don't sleep forever all a real nigga won't  
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up  
Fired fire  
All I want is tonight is just to get high up  
All I want is all I want is  
Loyalty loyalty loyalty  
Loyalty loyalty loyalty  
10-4 no switching sides  
Feel somethin' wrong  
You acting shifty you don't ride  
With me no more I need  
Loyalty loyalty loyalty  
Loyalty loyalty loyalty  
Tell me who you loyal to  
Is it money is it fame  
Is it weed is it drink  
Is it comin' down with the loud pipes and the rain  
Big chillin' only for the power in your name  
Tell me who you loyal to  
Is it love for the streets when the lights get dark  
Is it unconditional when the 'Rari don't start  
Tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart  
Tell me who you loyal to  
Do it start with your women or your man  
Mmm  
Do it end with your family and friends  
Mmm  
Or you're loyal to yourself in advance  
I said tell me who you loyal to  
Is it anybody that you would lie for  
Anybody you would slide for  
Anybody you would die for  
That's what God for  
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up  
Fired fire  
All I want is tonight is just to get high up  
All I want is all I want is  
Loyalty loyalty loyalty  
Loyalty loyalty loyalty  
10-4 no switching sides  
Feel somethin' wrong  
You acting shifty you don't ride  
With me no more I need  
Loyalty loyalty loyalty  
Loyalty loyalty loyalty  
It's so hard to be humble  
It's so hard to be  
All I know is I'm trying  
All I know is I'm dying  
Baby
