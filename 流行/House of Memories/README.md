### House Of Memories 歌词：

If you're a lover, you should know  
The lonely moments just get lonelier  
The longer you're in love  
Than if you were alone  
Memories turn into daydreams  
Become a taboo

I don't want to be afraid  
The deeper that I go  
It takes my breath away  
Soft hearts electric souls  
Heart to heart and eyes to eyes  
Is this taboo?

Baby we built this house  
On memories  
Take my picture now  
Shake it till you see it  
And when your fantasies  
Become your legacy  
Promise me a place  
In your House Of Memories

I think of you from time to time  
More than I thought I would  
You were just too kind  
And I was too young to know  
That's all that really matters  
I was a fool

Baby we built this house  
On memories  
Take my picture now  
Shake it till you see it  
And when your fantasies  
Become your legacy  
Promise me a place  
In your House Of Memories

Those thoughts of  
Past lovers  
They'll always haunt me  
I wish I  
Could believe  
You'd never wrong me  
Then will you  
Remember  
Me in the same way  
As I remember you

Baby we built this house  
On memories  
Take my picture now  
Shake it till you see it  
And when your fantasies  
Become your legacy  
Promise me a place

Baby we built this house  
On memories  
Take my picture now  
Shake it till you see it  
And when your fantasies  
Become your legacy  
Promise me a place  
In your House Of Memories  
In your House Of Memories  
Promise me a place
