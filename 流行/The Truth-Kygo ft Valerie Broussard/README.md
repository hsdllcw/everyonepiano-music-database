### The Truth歌词：

I'm having thoughts again  
Hey are we more than friends  
Been tryin' to say those words for days  
'Cause I've been noticin'  
That when I look at you  
You turn your head and look away  
Been dancing 'round not feelin' in the dark  
Can't get it out why can't you tell me now  
Oh I've been up all night wondering why you lie  
When your heart is sayin' more than you do  
I feel it every time  
That I look in your eyes  
Your heart ain't what I always knew  
And that's the truth  
Truth aah truth aah  
And that's the truth  
Truth aah truth aah  
And that's the truth  
Truth aah truth aah  
And that's the truth  
Truth aah truth aah  
And that's the truth  
Those things we could have said  
On loop inside my head  
It's with me everywhere I go  
Might be a mistake  
But that's a risk I'll take  
If I don't ask I'll never know  
Been dancing 'round not feelin' in the dark  
Can't get it out why can't you tell me now  
Oh I've been up all night wondering why you lie  
When your heart is saying more than you do  
I feel it every time  
That I look in your eyes  
Your heart ain't what I always knew  
And that's the truth  
Truth aah truth aah  
And that's the truth  
Truth aah truth aah  
And that's the truth  
Truth aah truth aah  
And that's the truth  
Truth aah truth aah  
And that's the truth  
And that's the truth  
And that's the truth
