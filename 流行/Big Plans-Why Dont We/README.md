### Big Plans歌词：

Work all day work all night  
Might not get no sleep tonight  
Baby can you stay up  
We could talk we could dance  
Don't matter the circumstance  
We don't let it change us  
That's the beautiful thing about us  
For all the diamonds and rings we got trust  
Roll with me get it right faded on a summer night  
Let's see where it takes us  
I got real big plans baby for you and me  
So love me for who I am and for who I'm gonna be  
Ain't got everything you want but got everything you need  
So take a chance take a chance on me  
I got real big plans baby for you and me  
So love me for who I am and for who I'm gonna be  
Ain't got everything you want but got everything you need  
So take a chance take a chance on me  
I got real big plans  
Hold up hold up baby  
I got real big plans  
Hold up hold up baby  
Know you're tired know you're down  
Know you wanna leave this town  
Baby give me one year yeah  
Take my hand take a leap  
Girl you gotta wait and see  
Where I take it from here  
That's the beautiful thing about you  
I know that you'd do the same in my shoes  
Never switch never stop  
I could see us at the top  
Girl why don't we go there  
I got real big plans baby for you and me  
So love me for who I am and for who I'm gonna be  
Ain't got everything you want but got everything you need  
So take a chance take a chance on me  
I got real big plans baby for you and me  
So love me for who I am and for who I'm gonna be  
Ain't got everything you want but got everything you need  
So take a chance take a chance on me  
I got real big plans  
Hold up hold up baby  
I got real big plans  
Hold up hold up baby
