Can't Feel My Face歌词：

And I know she'll be the death of me, at least we'll both be numb  
And she'll always get the best of me, the worst is yet to come  
But at least we'll both be beautiful and stay forever young  
This I know, (yeah) this I know

She told me, "Don't worry about it"  
She told me, "Don't worry no more"  
We both knew we can't go without it  
She told me you'll never be in love-oh-oh, wooh

I can't feel my face when I'm with you  
But I love it, but I love it, oh  
I can't feel my face when I'm with you  
But I love it, but I love it, oh

And I know she'll be the death of me, at least we'll both be numb  
And she'll always get the best of me, the worst is yet to come  
All the misery was necessary when we're deep in love  
Yes I know (yes I know), yeah, I know

She told me, "Don't worry about it"  
She told me, "Don't worry no more"  
We both knew we can't go without it  
She told me you'll never be in love-oh-oh, wooh

I can't feel my face when I'm with you  
But I love it, but I love it, oh  
I can't feel my face when I'm with you  
But I love it, but I love it, oh

I can't feel my face when I'm with you  
But I love it, but I love it, oh  
I can't feel my face when I'm with you  
But I love it, but I love it, oh

She told me, "Don't worry about it"  
She told me, "Don't worry no more"  
We both know we can't go without it  
She told me you'll never be in love-oh-oh  
Wooh

I can't feel my face when I'm with you  
But I love it, but I love it, oh  
I can't feel my face when I'm with you  
But I love it, but I love it, oh

I can't feel my face when I'm with you  
But I love it, but I love it, oh  
I can't feel my face when I'm with you  
But I love it, but I love it, oh
