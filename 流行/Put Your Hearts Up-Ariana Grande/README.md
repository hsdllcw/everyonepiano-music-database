### Put Your Hearts Up歌词：

Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah  
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah  
If we give a little love,  
maybe we can change the world  
You think you're so small  
Like you're itty bitty.  
Just one match in the lights of the city  
Walking by strangers on the side of the street  
Like a quarter in a cup'll get 'em off on their feet, like  
You think you're never gonna make your mark  
Sit back and watch the world while it falls apart, like  
Out of sight, out of mind, like, like  
It's just a waste of time,  
Like, like, like  
Hey yeah yeah yeah  
Hey yeah yeah  
If we give a little love  
Maybe we can change the world  
I said  
Hey yeah yeah yeah  
Hey yeah yeah  
Sing it if you're with me  
All you boys and all you girls  
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah  
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah  
If we give a little love maybe we can change the world  
Wishing on a shooting star in the sky  
We can do anything if we try  
Can't resurrect Ghandi, resurrect king  
But if we put our heads together  
We can do anything like  
You don't have to be a billionaire  
You don't have to have much too show how much care  
Like give a wink, give a kiss  
Like give a little happiness  
Like like like  
Hey yeah yeah yeah  
Hey yeah yeah  
If we give a little love  
Maybe we can change the world  
I said  
Hey yeah yeah yeah  
Hey yeah yeah  
Sing it if you're with me  
All you boys and all you girls  
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah  
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah  
If we give a little love maybe we can change the world  
Don't let em bring you down now, down now  
Don't let em bring you down now, down now  
And get up and you love now love now  
And get up and you love now love now  
Don't let em bring you down now, down now  
Don't let em bring you down now, down now  
And get up and you love now love now  
And get up and you love now love now  
Hey yeah yeah yeah  
Hey yeah yeah  
If we give a little love  
Maybe we can change the world  
I said  
Hey yeah yeah yeah  
Hey yeah yeah  
Sing it if you're with me  
All you boys and all you girls  
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah  
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah  
If we give a little love maybe we can change the world  
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah  
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah  
If we give a little love maybe we can change the world  
Hey yeah yeah yeah
