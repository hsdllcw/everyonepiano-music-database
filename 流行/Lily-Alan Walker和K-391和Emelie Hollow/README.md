**Lily双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Lily_ 是Alan Walker、K-391与Emelie
Hollow一同合作的单曲。此曲以Lily的经历为线索，告诉我们她在一个奇幻森林的经历，Lily生活在自己的影子之中，从而一直不敢面对真正的自己，她其实一直想挣脱自己的影子，一次次的挣扎，但最终都已失败告终，BGM也描写出了她心情的波动。Alan
Walker其实想告诉我们：不要成为自己的傀儡，要面对自己，面对困难，面对这大千世界。从这点也可以看出Alan
Walker的歌不在只是单纯的有节奏，而是更有深意了，更有韵律了，更加耐人寻味了。

### Lily歌词：

Lily was a little girl  
Afraid of the big wide world  
She grew up within her castle walls  
Now and then she tried to run  
And then on the night with the setting sun  
She went in the woods away  
So afraid  
All alone  
They warned her  
Don't go there  
There's creatures  
Who are hiding in the dark  
Then something came creeping  
It told her  
Don't you worry just  
Follow everywhere I go  
Top of all the mountains or valley low  
I'll give you everything you've been dreaming of  
Just let me in ooh  
Everything you want in gold  
I'll be the magic story you've been told  
And you'll be safe under my control  
Just let me in ooh  
Just let me in ooh  
She knew she was hypnotized  
And walking on cold thin ice  
Then it broke  
She awoke  
Again  
Then she ran faster and started screaming  
Is there someone out there  
Please help me  
Come get me  
Behind her she could hear it say  
Follow everywhere I go  
Top of all the mountains or valley low  
I'll give you everything you've been dreaming of  
Just let me in ooh  
Everything you want in gold  
I'll be the magic story you've been told  
And you'll be safe under my control  
Just let me in ooh  
Just let me in ooh  
Everything you want in gold  
I'll be the magic story you've been told  
And you'll be safe under my control  
Just let me in ooh  
Follow everywhere I go  
Top of all the mountains or valley low  
I'll give you everything you've been dreaming of  
Just let me in ooh  
Then she ran faster and started screaming  
Is there someone out there  
Please help me  
Just let me in ooh
