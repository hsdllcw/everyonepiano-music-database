### Anxiety歌词：

Julia Michaels：  
My friends they wanna take me to the movies  
I tell 'em to f**k off I'm holding hands with my depression  
And right when I think I've overcome it  
Anxiety starts kicking in to teach that s**t a lesson  
Oh I try my best just to be social  
I make all these plans with friends and hope they call and cancel  
Then I overthink about the things I'm missing  
Now I'm wishing I was with 'em  
Feel like I'm always apologizing for feeling  
Like I'm out of my mind when I'm doing just fine  
And my exes all say that I'm hard to deal with  
And I admit it yeah  
But all my friends they don't know what it's like what it's like  
They don't understand why I can't sleep through the night  
I've been told that I could take something to fix it  
D**n I wish it I wish it was that simple ah  
All my friends they don't know what it's like what it's like  
Selena Gomez：  
Always wanted to be one of those people in the room  
That says something and everyone puts their hand up  
Like "If you're sad put your hand up  
If you hate someone put your hand up  
If you're scared put your hand up"  
Feel like I'm always apologizing for feeling  
Like I'm out of my mind when I'm doing just fine  
And my exes all say that I'm hard to deal with  
And I admit it it's true  
But all my friends they don't know what it's like what it's like  
They don't understand why I can't sleep through the night  
And I thought that I could take something to fix it  
D**n I wish it I wish it was that simple ah  
All my friends they don't know what it's like what it's like  
Julia Michaels/Selena Gomez：  
I got all these thoughts running through my mind  
All the d**n time and I can't seem to shut it off  
I think I'm doing fine most of the time  
I think that I'm alright but I can't seem to shut it off  
I got all these thoughts running through my mind  
All the d**n time and I can't seem to shut it off  
I think I'm doing fine most of the time  
I say that I'm alright but I can't seem to shut it off  
Shut it shut it yeah  
Julia Michaels/Selena Gomez：  
But all my friends they don't know what it's like what it's like  
They don't understand why I can't sleep through the night  
I've been told that I could take something to fix it  
D**n I wish it I wish it was that simple ah  
All my friends they don't know what it's like what it's like  
Li-i-i-i-ike  
What it's like what it's like  
Hmm mm mm mm mm mmm  
What it's like  
I love this song
