### Walk of Life歌词：

Here comes Johnny singing oldies, goldies  
Be-Bop-A-Lua, Baby What I Say  
Here comes Johnny singing I Gotta Woman  
Down in the tunnels, trying to make it pay  
He got the action, he got the motion  
Yeah, the boy can play  
Dedication devotion  
Turning all the night time into the day

He do the song about the sweet lovin' woman  
He do the song about the knife  
He do the walk, he do the walk of life

Here comes Johnny and he'll tell you the story  
Hand me down mu walkin' shoes  
Here come Johnny with the power and the glory  
Backbeat the talkin' blues  
He got the action, he got the motion  
Yeah, the boy can play  
Dedication devotion  
Turning all the night time into the day

He do the song about the sweet lovin' woman  
He do the song about the knife  
He do the walk, he do the walk of life

Here comes Johnny singing oldies, goldies  
Be-Bop-A-Lula, Baby What I Say  
Here comes Johnny singing I Gotta Woman  
Down in the tunnels, trying to make it pay  
He got the action, he got the motion  
Yeah the boy can play  
Decidation devotion  
Turning all the night time into the day

And after all the violence and double talk  
There's just a song in the trouble and the strife  
You do the walk, you do the walk of life
