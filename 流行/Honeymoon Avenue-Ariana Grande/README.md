### Honeymoon Avenue歌词：

I looked in my rear view mirror and  
It seemed to make a lot more sense  
Than what I see ahead of us, ahead of us, yeah.  
I'm ready to make that turn  
Before we both crash and burn  
Cause that could be the death of us, the death of us, baby

You know how to drive in rain  
And you decided not to make a change  
Stuck in the same old lane  
Going the wrong way home

I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic,  
I'm under pressure  
Cause I can't have you the way that I want  
Let's just go back to the way it was

When we were on Honeymoon Avenue  
Honeymoon Avenue  
Baby, coastin' like crazy  
Can we get back to the way it was?

Hey, what happened to the butterflies?  
Guess they encountered that stop sign  
And my heart is at a yellow light, a yellow light  
Hey, right when I think that we found it,  
Well, that's when we start turning around  
You're saying, "Baby, don't worry,"  
But we're still going the wrong way, baby

You know how to drive in rain  
And you decided not to make a change  
Stuck in the same old lane  
Going the wrong way home

I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic,  
I'm under pressure  
Cause I can't have you the way that I want  
Let's just go back to the way it was

When we were on Honeymoon Avenue  
Honeymoon Avenue  
Baby, coastin' like crazy  
Can we get back to the way it was?

They say only fools fall in love  
Well, they must've been talking about us  
And sometimes I feel like I've been here before  
I could be wrong, but I know I'm right  
We gon' be lost if we continue to fight  
Honey I know, yeah,  
We can find our way home

I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic,  
I'm under pressure  
Cause I can't have you the way that I want  
Let's just go back to the way it was

When we were on Honeymoon Avenue  
Honeymoon Avenue  
My baby, coastin' like crazy  
Can we get back to the way it was?

When we were on Honeymoon Avenue  
Honeymoon Avenue  
Baby, coastin' like crazy  
Can we get back to the way it was?

Baby, you know how to drive in rain  
You decided not to make a change  
Stuck in the same old lane  
Going the wrong way home

I feel like my heart is stuck in... traffic,  
I'm under..., pressure, pressure  
Let's just go back to the way it was

When we were on...  
(Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue)

Let's just go back, back, back.
