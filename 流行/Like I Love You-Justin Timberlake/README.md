### Like I Love You歌词：

Just something about you  
The way I'm lookin' at you, whatever  
You keep lookin' at me  
You gettin' scared now, right?  
Don't fear me baby, it's just Justin  
It feel good right? Listen  
I kind of noticed somethin wasn't right  
In your beautiful face  
It's kind of weird to me since you're so fine  
If it's up to me, your face will change  
If you smile, that should set the tone  
Just be limber  
And if you let go, the music should move your bones  
Just remember  
Sing this song with me  
Ain't nobody love you like I love you  
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya  
Late at night, I talk to you  
You will know the difference when I touch you  
People are so phony, noisy 'cause they're lonely  
Aren't you sick of the same thing?  
They say so and so was dating, love you or they're hatin'  
When it doesn't matter anyway  
'Cause we're here tonight  
If you smile that should set the tone  
Just be limber, baby  
And if you let go, the music should move your bones  
Baby, just remember  
Sing this song with me  
Ain't nobody love you like I love you  
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya  
Late at night, I talk to you  
You will know the difference when I touch you  
Yeah, you know I can make ya happy  
I could change your life  
If you give me that chance to be your man  
I won't let you down, baby  
If you give me that chance to be your man  
Here baby, put on my jacket and then  
Maybe we'll fly tonight  
(I just wanna love you baby)  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Girl  
Maybe we'll fly tonight  
(I just wanna love you baby)  
Girl  
Ma, what chu wanna do? I'm in front of you  
Grab a friend, see I can have fun with two  
Or me and you put on a stage show  
And the mall kids, that's how to change low  
From them you heard, "Wow, it's the same glow"  
Look at me, I say, "Yeah, it's the same dough"  
We the same type, you my air of life  
You have sleepin' in the same bed, every night  
Go rock with me, you deserve the best  
Take a few shots, let it burn in your chest  
We could ride down, pumpin' N.E.R.D. in the deck  
Funny how a few words turn into sex  
Play this free, joint called, "Brain"  
Ma, take a hint, make me swerve in the lane  
The name Malicious and I burn every track  
Clipse and J. Timberlake, now how heavy is that?  
Maybe we'll fly tonight  
(I just wanna love you baby)  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Girl  
Maybe we'll fly tonight  
(I just wanna love you baby)  
Girl  
Ain't nobody love you like I love you  
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya  
Late at night, I talk to you  
You will know the difference when I  
You know, I used to dream about this when I was a little boy  
I never thought it would end up this way, drums  
It's kind of special right? Yeah  
You know, you think about it  
Sometimes people just destined  
Destined to do what they do  
And that's what it is, now everybody dance
