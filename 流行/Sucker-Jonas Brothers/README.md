**Sucker双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Sucker_ 是美国流行摇滚乐队Jonas
Brothers（乔纳森兄弟）演唱的歌曲。乔纳森兄弟的成功流行与其说是音乐的出色，还不如说是迪士尼公司定位的精妙。他们的音乐与前辈Hanson、The
Moffatts比起来差得远。但是他们的优势也是前两者不曾拥有的，那就是在影视方面。乔纳森兄弟是美国流行的中坚力量，但不只是单纯的流行音乐中坚力量，他们是流行文化的力量，外貌和演唱同样出色的他们是全能选手。

### Sucker歌词：

Nick Jonas：  
We go together  
Better than birds of a feather you and me  
We change the weather yeah  
I'm feeling heat in December when you're 'round me  
Joe Jonas/Nick Jonas：  
I've been dancing on top of cars and stumbling out of bars  
I follow you through the dark can't get enough  
You're the medicine and the pain the tattoo inside my brain  
And baby you know it's obvious  
I'm a sucker for you  
You say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly  
I'm a sucker for you yeah  
Any road you take you know that you'll find me  
I am a sucker for all the subliminal things  
No one knows about you  
About you 'bout you  
About you  
And you're making the typical me  
Break my typical rules  
It's true I'm a sucker for you yeah  
Nick Jonas：  
Don't complicate it yeah  
'Cause I know you and you know everything about me  
I can't remember  
All of the nights I don't remember when you're 'round me  
Oh yeah yeah  
Joe Jonas：  
I've been dancing on top of cars and stumbling out of bars  
I follow you through the dark can't get enough  
You're the medicine and the pain the tattoo inside my brain  
And baby you know it's obvious  
I'm a sucker for you  
Say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly  
I'm a sucker for you yeah  
Any road you take you know that you'll find me  
I am a sucker for all the subliminal things  
No one knows about you  
About you 'bout you  
About you  
And you're making the typical me  
Break my typical rules  
It's true I'm a sucker for you yeah  
I've been dancing on top of cars and stumbling out of bars  
I follow you through the dark can't get enough  
You're the medicine and the pain the tattoo inside my brain  
And baby you know it's obvious  
I'm a sucker for you yeah  
Say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly  
I'm a sucker for you yeah  
Any road you take you know that you'll find me  
I am a sucker for all the subliminal things  
No one knows about you  
About you 'bout you  
About you  
And you're making the typical me  
Break my typical rules  
It's true I'm a sucker for you  
I'm a sucker for you
