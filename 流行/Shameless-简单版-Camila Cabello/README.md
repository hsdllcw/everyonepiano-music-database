### Shameless歌词：

Don't speak now don't try  
It's been a secret for the longest time  
Don't run no don't hide  
Been running from it for the longest time  
So many mornings I woke up confused  
In my dreams I do anything I want to you  
My emotions are naked they're taking me out of my mind  
Right now I'm shameless  
Screamin' my lungs out for ya  
Not afraid to face it  
I need you more than I want to  
I need you more than I want to  
Show me you're shameless  
Write it on my neck why don't ya  
And I won't erase it  
I need you more than I want to  
I need you more than I want to  
No no don't wanna do this  
No no don't wanna do this  
No no don't wanna do this  
No no don't wanna do this  
So we're there  
Now it's real  
Now that you have me do you want me still  
My kisses are history they go back a long time  
And I'm tired of loving somebody that's not mine  
So many mornings I woke up confused  
In my dreams I do anything I want to you  
My emotions are naked they're taking me out of my mind  
Right now I'm shameless  
Screamin' my lungs out for ya  
Not afraid to face it  
I need you more than I want to  
I need you more than I want to  
Show me you're shameless  
Write it on my neck why don't ya  
And I won't erase it  
I need you more than I want to  
I need you more than I want to  
No no don't wanna do this  
No no don't wanna do this  
No no don't wanna do this  
No no don't wanna do this  
There's just inches in between us  
I want you to give in I want you to give in  
There is tension in between us  
I just wanna to give in  
And I don't care if I'm forgiven  
Right now I'm shameless  
Screamin' my lungs out for ya  
Not afraid to face it  
I need you more than I want to  
I need you more than I want to  
Show me you're shameless  
Write it on my neck why don't ya  
And I won't erase it  
I need you more than I want to  
I need you more than I want to  
No no don't wanna do this  
No no don't wanna do this  
No no don't wanna do this  
No no don't wanna do this
