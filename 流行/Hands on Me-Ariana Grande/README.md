**Hands on Me双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Hands on Me_ 是Ariana Grande第二张录音室专辑《My Everything》的一首歌曲。My
Everything（译名：我的一切）已于2014年8月25日发行，专辑在80多个国家的iTunes音乐下载榜斩获冠军。

《My
Everything》见证了这位来自尼克台二十二岁新星的成长。这是有着充满自信、明智的、勇敢做自己的流行宣言、零乱的EDM节奏混合着摇滚舞曲中女歌手的嗓音。她有着比Selena
Gomez，Katy
Perry或在电台听到的歌手们更具风范的嗓音。然而她离玛丽亚•凯莉和惠特妮•休斯顿还很远。她懂得如何自然地唱歌，甚至是当她清唱着打开黑胶唱片，把她自己变成了一首En
Vouge（美国R&B女团）的赞美诗。她的成功源于蕴藏在她小小身躯中令人惊艳的嗓音，她歌中的那些男孩让她失去理智。Grande并不会傻傻地等待被对方伤害，她属于“我早就看开了”这类，这让她的歌声充满感情。Ariana
Grande的前途是无可限量的。正如My Everything所展示出的，她已经成为了乐坛的中坚力量。

### Hands on Me歌词：

Keep your hands on me  
Don't take them off until I say so  
Let me break you off  
We'll be taking off  
Or maybe making love  
You just keep your eyes on my you know what  
Trembling, when you touch  
Rush is racing body baking  
Picture me and you making  
Making sweet love  
Baby give it to me  
Eyes on me, dance on me tonight  
Your all, all on me  
Keep your hands on me  
Don't take them off  
Put your hands on it
