### Congratulations歌词：

T-Series! (Yeah!)  
It's your big day! (Woo!)  
Incredible job!  
I know we had our differences  
But today, I just wanna tell you  
Ay congratulations, it's a celebration  
Party all day, I know you've been waitin' (Here we go!)  
Ay congratulations(Woo!), it's a celebration  
I just wanna tell you that I think that you're amazing  
Ay congratulations to your corporation  
Guess to beat one Swedish boy, you need a billion Asians  
Yeah, you did it very nice, and all it took  
Was a massive corporate entity with every song in Bollywood  
Now you're at number one, hope you did nothing wrong  
Like starting your business by selling pirated songs  
Oops! Didn't think we'd see? It's right there on Wikipedia  
Get used to your past being held against you by the media (Uh oh)  
I'm sure right now there's nothing  
That you're doing that's illegal, yeah  
I'm certain that you haven't had collusions with the mafia  
For legal reasons, that's a joke  
For legal reasons, that's a joke  
For serious, Indian mafia, please don't kill me, that's a joke  
India, I'm sorry about the memes, you're the best  
I love my Indian Bros, from Bombay to Bangladesh  
I'll take on all the world for you, I'm a heavy hitter  
'Bout to cause a genocide so you can call me Hi—  
Ay congratulations, it's a celebration (Oh!)  
Party all day, I know you've been waitin' (Oh yeah!)  
Ay congratulations, it's a celebration (Yeah!)  
I just wanna tell you that I think that you're amazing  
Congratulations (Uh)  
Congratulations (It's your big day! Woo!)  
Congratulations  
Congratulations (Such a big day)  
I got a letter in the post, hmm, what is this? (Hmm)  
T-Series saying "Cease and desist"  
Had a problem with me telling them to hold their defecation  
But let me educate you, silly, that's not defamation (Woo)  
T-Series can eat a d**k (Still not defamation)  
Suck my ****ing Swedish meatballs (Still not defamation, yum)  
Did you know that Indians have poo-poo in their brains?  
That's a blatant racist lie  
Yeah, but still not defamation! (Woo)  
India got YouTube figured out, that's sick, son  
How 'bout next you figure how to fix the caste system? (Oof)  
Maybe all those ads will solve your crippling poverty  
But looking at T-Series' past,  
I'm guessing not probably But never mind the poor people,  
We just here to party  
Just here to pop some bottles with the 9-Year-Old Army  
Non-alcoholic 'cause I had a real problem  
But we still out here living like we 'bout to kamikaze  
So this is it, thanks for sticking with my channel  
Ever since I was a nobody, screaming at barrels  
Yeah, this is it, it's been an adventure  
It's the end of the reign of Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg  
Through all the change and controversy, you've been by my side  
There’s no army in the world that would rather give me watch time  
It's been a wild ride, so while I can still be heard  
Here's one last brofist from the number one in the world  
Ay congratulations, it's a celebration (Oh)  
Party all day (Skrra), I know you've been waitin'  
(Yeet, party all day, yeah)  
Ay congratulations (Woo!), it's a celebration (Oh)  
I just wanna tell you that I think that you're amazing  
Congratulations (Oh, ooh hoo)  
Congratulations (Skrattar du, it's your big day!)  
Congratulations (I'm ****ing lit!)  
Congratulations (Such a big day!)  
Oh yeah, yeah  
Congratulations, T-Series! You did it!  
Yatta desu ne  
Hope that #MeToo stuff doesn't severely affect your bottom line
