### Rockstar歌词：

There's a girl in the backyard bangin' on her drum  
Sittin' in a junk pile laughing at the sun  
Singin' "ah ha ha I just wanna be a rockstar"  
There's a boy in the backseat singin' to the song  
Playin' on the radio knowing he's the one  
Singin' "ah ha ha I just wanna be a rockstar"  
Singin' "ah ha ha I was born to be a rockstar "  
There's a girl in the tree top looking at the stars  
Waiting for a touchdown comin' in from Mars  
Thinkin' "is there anybody out there "  
There's a boy thinking of here playin' his guitar  
Searching for the answer buried in his heart  
Singin' "ah ha ha is there anybody out there "  
Singin' "ah ha ha is there anybody out there"  
If there's a meaning can you show me a sign  
The more I look it just gets harder to find  
The world is spinnin' and I wanna know why  
And we're all getting older wishin' we were young  
Hangin' on the memory of what we would become  
Singin' "ah ha ha I was born to be a rockstar"  
Singin' "ah ha ha I just wanna be a rockstar"  
Singin' "ah ha ha I was born to be a rockstar "  
If there's a meaning can you show me a sign  
The more I look it just gets harder to find  
The world is spinnin' and I wanna know why  
And maybe we will never figure it out  
I got a feelin' that's what life's all about  
I'm learning anything is possible now  
Take a ticket and get off the line  
Take a ticket and get off the line  
Take a ticket and get off the line  
Take a ticket and get off the line  
Take a ticket and get off the line  
Take a ticket and get off the line  
Take a ticket and get off the line  
Take a ticket and get off the line  
Take a ticket and get off the line  
Take a ticket and get off the line  
Take a ticket and get off the line  
Take a ticket and get off the line  
Take a ticket and get off the line  
Take a ticket and get off the line  
Take a ticket and get off the line
