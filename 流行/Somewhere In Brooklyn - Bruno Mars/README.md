Wop音乐对他有很大影响，这种和声层叠的音乐形式直接有力地表达情感，“迷人、简单、浪漫。”Hooligan则是流氓阿飞的意思，他说专辑名字表达了自己性格的两面，同时也合适男女歌迷都来听。在美国，专辑

### Somewhere In Brooklyn歌词：

She was covered in leather and gold  
Twenty one years old  
I lost her in the cold  
It's unfair, she's out there

Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn  
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn

Little miss perfect sitting at the train stop  
Red nike high tops listening to hip-hop  
While we were waiting started conversating  
Before I got her name along came a train

(uuuuuuuh) next stop Brooklyn  
(uuuuuuuh) now I'm lookin'

She was covered in leather and gold  
Twenty one years old  
I lost her in the cold  
It's unfair, she's out there  
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn  
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn

On the street kickin rocks circling the same block  
Green farm flatbush checking every corner shop  
Tappin' people's shoulders askin if they know her  
Everyday's the same back to the train

(uuuuuuuh) next stop Brooklyn  
(uuuuuuuh) I'm still lookin'

She was covered in leather and gold  
21 years old  
I lost her in the cold  
It's unfair, she's out there  
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn  
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn

Oh-oh-oh-oh  
I wonder if we'll ever meet again  
Oh-oh-oh-oh  
I wonder we we'll ever meet again  
Yeah I wonder if we'll meet again  
I hope we do somewhere in Brooklyn
