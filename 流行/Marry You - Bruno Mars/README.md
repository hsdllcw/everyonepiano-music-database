_Marry You_ 是出自于Bruno Mars《Doo-Wops & Hooligans》专辑里的一首好听的歌曲。

Bruno Mars在美国夏威夷的威基基(Waikiki)岛上出生并长大，是父母的六个孩子中的一个，而父母分别是波
多黎各和菲律宾人。他出生在一个音乐家庭，给了他多元化的Reggae，摇滚，嘻哈和R&B等多种风格。在很小的时候，Bruno
Mars就开始模仿和表演例如猫王、迈克尔杰克逊等很具影响力的艺术家的歌曲。1990年他四岁的时候被MidWeek杂志精选为“小猫王”，之后在1992年于拉斯维加斯的蜜月影片中扮演小猫王。2003年，17岁的他于President
Theodore Roosevelt高中毕业，之后搬到洛杉矶追求他自己的音乐生涯。

### Marry You歌词：

It's a beautiful night  
We're looking for something dumb to do  
Hey baby i think i wanna marry you  
Is it the look in your eyes or is it this dancing juice  
Who cares baby, i think i wanna marry you  
Well I know this little chapel on the boulevard  
we can go  
no one will know  
Oh，come on girl  
Who cares if we're trashed  
got a pocket full of cash we can blow  
shots of patron  
and it's on girl  
Don't say no no no no no  
just say yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
and we'll go go go go go  
If you're ready,like i'm ready  
’Cause it's a beautiful night  
We're looking for something dumb to do  
Hey baby i think i wanna marry you  
Is it the look in your eyes or is it this dancing juice  
Who cares baby,i think i wanna marry you  
I’ll go get a ring let the choir bells sing like oooh  
So whatcha wanna do?  
Let’s just run girl.  
If we wake up and you wanna break up that’s cool.  
No, I won’t blame you;  
It was fun girl.  
Don't say no no no no no  
Just say yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
And we'll go go go go go  
If you're ready,like i'm ready  
It's a beautiful night  
we're looking for something dumb to do  
Hey baby i think i wanna marry you  
Is it the look in your eyes or is it this dancing juice  
Who cares baby, i think i wanna marry you  
oh  
Just say i do  
tell me right now baby  
tell me right now baby,baby  
Just say i do  
tell me right now baby  
tell me right now baby,baby  
oh  
It's a beautiful night  
we're looking for something dumb to do  
Hey baby i think i wanna marry you  
Is it the look in your eyes or is it this dancing juice  
Who cares baby, i think i wanna marry you
