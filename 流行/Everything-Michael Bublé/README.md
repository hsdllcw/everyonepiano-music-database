### Everything歌词：

You're a falling star  
You're the getaway car  
You're the line in the sand  
When I go too far

You're the swimming pool  
On an August day  
And you're the perfect thing to say

And you play it coy  
But it's kinda cute  
Oh when you smile at me  
You know exactly what you do

Baby don't pretend  
That you don't know it's true  
'Cause you can see it  
When I look at you

And in this crazy life  
And through these crazy times  
It's you, it's you  
You make me sing  
You're every line  
You're every word  
You're everything

You're a carousel  
You're a wishing well  
And you light me up  
When you ring my bell

You're a mystery  
You're from outer space  
You're every minute of my every day

And I can't believe  
That I'm your man  
And I get to kiss you baby  
Just because I can

Whatever comes our way  
We'll see it through  
And you know  
That's what our love can do

And in this crazy life  
And through these crazy times  
It's you, it's you  
You make me sing  
You're every line  
You're every word  
You're everything

And so la la la la, la la la  
So la la la la, la la la

And in this crazy life  
And through these crazy times  
It's you, it's you  
You make me sing  
You're every line  
You're every word  
You're everything

You're every song  
And I sing along  
'Cause you're my everything  
Yeah, yeah

So la la la la, la la la  
So la la la la, la la-la-la, la la la
