### Dance Monkey歌词：

They say "Oh my God I see the way you shine  
Take your hands my dear and place them both in mine"  
You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by  
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time  
Ooh I see you see you see you every time  
And oh my I I like your style  
You you make me make me make me wanna cry  
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time  
So they say  
"Dance for me dance for me dance for me oh-oh-oh  
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before"  
They say  
"Move for me move for me move for me ayy-ayy-ayy  
And when you're done I'll make you do it all again"  
I said "Oh my God I see you walking by  
Take my hands my dear and look me in my eyes"  
Just like a monkey I've been dancin' my whole life  
But you just beg to see me dance just one more time  
Ooh I see you see you see you every time  
And oh my I I like your style  
You you make me make me make me wanna cry  
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time  
So they say  
"Dance for me dance for me dance for me oh-oh-oh  
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before"  
They say  
"Move for me move for me move for me ayy-ayy-ayy  
And when you're done I'll make you do it all again"  
They say  
"Dance for me dance for me dance for me  
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh  
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before"  
They say  
"Move for me move for me move for me ayy-ayy-ayy  
And when you're done I'll make you do it all again"  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Oh-oh oh-oh oh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh-ooh  
Ooh ah-ah ah-ah  
They say  
"Dance for me dance for me dance for me oh-oh-oh  
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before"  
They say  
"Move for me move for me move for me ayy-ayy-ayy  
And when you're done I'll make you do it all again"  
They say  
"Dance for me dance for me dance for me  
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh  
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before"  
They say  
"Move for me move for me move for me ayy-ayy-ayy  
And when you're done I'll make you do it all again  
All again"
