### Dance Monkey歌词：

They say oh my god I see the way you shine  
Take your hand my dear and place them both in mine  
You know you stopped me dead when I was passing by  
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time  
Ooh I see you see you see you every time  
And oh my I I I like your style  
You you make me make me make me wanna cry  
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time  
So I say  
Dance for me dance for me dance for me oh oh oh  
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before  
They say move for me move for me move for me  
Ay ay ay  
And when you're done I'll make you do it all again  
I said oh my god I see you walking by  
Take my hands my dear and look me in my eyes  
Just like a monkey I've been dancing my whole life  
And you just beg to see me dance just one more time  
Ooh I see you see you see you every time  
And oh my I I I like your style  
You you make me make me make me wanna cry  
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time  
So I say  
Dance for me dance for me dance for me oh oh oh  
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before  
They say move for me move for me move for me  
Ay ay ay  
And when you're done I'll make you do it all again  
They say  
Dance for me dance for me dance for me  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before  
They say move for me move for me move for me  
Ay ay ay  
And when you're done I'll make you do it all again  
Ooh all again all again  
Woah-oh woah-oh oh  
Ah ah ah ah ay  
They say  
Dance for me dance for me dance for me  
Oh oh oh  
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before  
They say move for me move for me move for me  
Ay ay ay  
And when you're done I'll make you do it all again  
They say  
Dance for me dance for me dance for me  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before  
They say move for me move for me move for me  
Ay ay ay  
And when you're done I'll make you do it all again  
All again
