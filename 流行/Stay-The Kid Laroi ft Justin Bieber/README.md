### Stay歌词：

Justin Bieber：  
Woah-oh woah-oh  
The Kid LAROI：  
I do the same thing I told you that I never would  
I told you I'd change even when I knew I never could  
I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you  
I need you to stay need you to stay hey  
Oh  
I get drunk wake up I'm wasted still  
I realize the time that I wasted here  
I feel like you can't feel the way I feel  
Oh I'll be f**ked up if you can't be right here  
Oh ooh-woah  
Oh ooh-woah ooh-woah  
Oh ooh-woah  
Oh ooh-woah ooh-woah  
Oh ooh-woah  
Oh ooh-woah ooh-woah  
Oh I'll be f**ked up if you can't be right here  
I do the same thing I told you that I never would  
I told you I'd change even when I knew I never could  
I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you  
I need you to stay need you to stay hey  
I do the same thing I told you that I never would  
I told you I'd change even when I knew I never could  
I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you  
I need you to stay need you to stay hey  
Justin Bieber：  
When I'm away from you I miss your touch  
Ooh  
You're the reason I believe in love  
Ooh  
It's been difficult for me to trust  
Ooh  
And I'm afraid that I'ma f**k it up  
Ooh  
Ain't no way that I can leave you stranded  
'Cause you ain't ever left me empty-handed  
And you know that I know that I can't live without you  
So baby stay

I'll be f**ked up if you can't be right here  
I do the same thing I told you that I never would  
I told you I'd change even when I knew I never could  
I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you  
I need you to stay need you to stay hey  
I do the same thing I told you that I never would  
I told you I'd change even when I knew I never could  
I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
