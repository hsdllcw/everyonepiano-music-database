### High For This 歌词：

You don't know what's in store  
But you know what you're here for  
Close your eyes, lay yourself beside me  
Hold tight for this ride  
We don't need no protection  
Come alone, we don't need attention

Open your hand, take a glass  
Don't be scared, I'm right here  
Even though, you don't roll  
Trust me girl, you wanna be high for this

Take it off, you want it off  
Cause I know what you're feeling  
It's okay, girl, I feel it too  
Let it be, baby breathe  
I swear I'm right here  
We'll be good, I promise, we'll be so good

Open your hand, take a glass  
Don't be scared, I'm right here  
Even though, you don't roll  
Trust me girl, you wanna be high for this  
You wanna be high for this  
You wanna be high for this  
You wanna be high for this  
You wanna be high for this
