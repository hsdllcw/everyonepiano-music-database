### Use This Gospel歌词：

Use this gospel for protection  
It's a hard road to Heaven  
We call on your blessings  
In the Father we put our faith  
King of the kingdom  
Our demons are tremblin'  
Holy angels defendin'  
In the Father we put our faith  
How could He not be the greatest  
In my bed under covers when undercovers had raided  
My presence is happy belated  
Fashionably late I'm just glad that you made it  
The best is yet to come  
I'm just glad that you waited  
They all say they real 'til it's time to appraise it  
I seen them come and go  
You only the latest  
But who am I to judge  
I'm crooked as Vegas  
Use this gospel for protection  
It's a hard road to Heaven  
We call on your blessings  
In the Father we put our faith  
King of the kingdom  
Our demons are tremblin'  
Holy angels defendin'  
In the Father we put our faith  
A lot of damaged souls I done damaged those  
And in my arrogance took a camera pose  
Caught with a trunk of Barry Manilows  
They sing a different tune when the slammer close  
From the concrete grew a rose  
They give you Wraith talk I give you faith talk  
Blindfolded on this road watch me faith walk  
Just hold on to your brother when his faith lost
