### Should've Been Us歌词：

Walking round with my head down  
But I can't hide with these high heels on  
Downtown in a thick crowd  
But it's just you that my mind is on  
Dressed up, got my heart messed up  
You got yours and I got mine  
It's unfair that I still care  
And I wonder where you are tonight

Thinking it could be different  
But maybe we missed it yea  
Thinking it could be different  
It could, it could

It should've been us  
Shoulda been a fire, shoulda been the perfect storm  
It should've been us  
Coulda been the real thing, now we'll never know for sure, ooh  
We were crazy, but amazing, baby we both know  
It should've been us, us  
It, it, it should've been us

Back and forth like a tug of war  
What's it all for, do I want it back  
I still got a little flame for ya  
Even though you drove me mad  
Now and then, I pretend  
That it's you when I close my eyes  
You got yours, I got mine  
But I wonder where you are tonight

It should've been us  
Shoulda been a fire, shoulda been the perfect storm  
It should've been us  
Coulda been the real thing, now we'll never know for sure, ooh  
We were crazy, but amazing, baby we both know  
It should've been us, us  
It, it, it should've been us

Oh oh, oh oh  
It should've been us, yeah  
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh  
Oh oh, oh oh  
It should've been us  
It, it, it should've been us

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh  
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh

Thinking it could be different  
But maybe we missed it  
Thinking it could be different  
It could, it could

It should've been us  
Shoulda been a fire, shoulda been the perfect storm  
It should've been us  
Coulda been the real thing, now we'll never know for sure, ooh  
We were crazy, but amazing, baby we both know  
It should've been us, us  
It, it, it should've been us

Oh oh, oh oh  
It should've been us, yeah  
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh  
Oh oh, oh oh  
It should've been us  
It, it, it should've been us

Oh oh, oh oh  
It should've been us  
Oh oh, oh oh  
You know it should've been us  
Oh oh, oh oh  
It should've been us  
It, it, it should've been us
