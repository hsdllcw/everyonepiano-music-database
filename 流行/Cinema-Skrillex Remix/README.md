Cinema歌词：

  
I could watch you for a lifetime  
You're my favorite movie  
A thousand endings  
You mean everything to me  
I never know what's comin'  
Forever fascinated  
Hope you don't stop runnin' to me  
'Cause I'll always be waitin'  
  
You are my cinema  
I could watch you forever  
Action, thriller  
I could watch you forever  
You are my cinema  
A Hollywood treasure  
Love you just the way you are  
My cinema, my cinema, my cinema...  
  
Get up, get down  
Three steps down  
My DJ gonna break it down  
  
Get up, get down  
Lose that sound  
My DJ gonna break it down  
  
Get up, get down  
Three steps down  
My DJ gonna break it down  
  
Get up, get down  
Lose that sound  
Drop the bass  
  
My cinema  
  
Stars spell out your name  
Like in a science fiction drama  
Romance growing  
Like a flower in the summer  
You always keep me guessin'  
Forever my wonderful  
Hope you start undressin'  
All my dreams and take me under  
  
You are my cinema  
I could watch you forever  
Action, thriller  
I could watch you forever  
You are my cinema  
A Hollywood treasure  
Love you just the way you are  
My cinema, my cinema, my cinema...  
  
Get up, get down  
Three steps down  
My DJ gonna break it down  
  
Get up, get down  
Lose that sound  
My DJ gonna break it down  
  
Get up, get down  
Three steps down  
My DJ gonna break it down  
  
Get up, get down  
Lose that sound  
Drop the bass  
  
A cinema  
  
You are my cinema  
I could watch you forever  
Action, thriller  
I could watch you forever  
You are my cinema  
A Hollywood treasure  
Love you just the way you are  
My cinema, my cinema, my cinema  
My cinema, my cinema, my cinema  
My cinema, my cinema, my cinema  
My cinema, my cinema, my cinema
