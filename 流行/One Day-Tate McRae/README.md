### One Day歌词：

She stares at her ceiling once again with a hundred thoughts  
Maybe he knows who I am probably not  
She walks down the hall with her  
Head down low scared to meet his eyes  
Even when she hears his voice she's swarmed with butterflies  
It's impossible to get you off my mind  
I think about 100 thoughts and you are 99  
I've understood that you will never be mine  
And that's fine I'm just breaking inside  
He always walks the crowded halls  
And is blinded by this light  
A girl who keeps her head down low  
And never shows her eyes  
He's tried to talk to her but there's no easy way  
'Cause every time he raises his voice she runs away  
Oh it's impossible to get you off my mind  
I think about 100 thoughts and you are 99  
I've understood that you will never be mine  
And that's fine I'm just breaking inside  
One day maybe she'll stay  
And start to head over his way  
And one day she'll look into his eyes  
And instead of breaking she'll call him mine  
One day he'll grab her by the waist  
And force them to meet face to face  
One day he'll look into her eyes  
And say that you're my only light  
It's impossible to get you off my mind  
I think about 100 thoughts and you are 99  
I understand that you will never be mine  
And that's fine I'm just breaking inside
