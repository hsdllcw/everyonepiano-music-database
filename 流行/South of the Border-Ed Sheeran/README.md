### South of the Border歌词：

She got the mmm brown eyes  
Caramel thighs long hair no wedding ring hey  
I saw you looking from across the way  
And now I really wanna know your name  
She got the mmm white dress  
But when she's wearing less  
Man you know that she drives me crazy  
The mmm brown eyes beautiful smile  
You know I love watching you do your thing  
I love her hips curves lips say the words  
Te amo mami  
Te amo mami  
I kiss her  
This love is like a dream  
So join me in this bed that I'm in  
Push up on me and sweat darling  
So I'm gonna put my time in  
I won't stop until the angels sing  
Jump in that water be free  
Come south of the border with me  
Jump in that water be free  
Come south of the border with me  
Jump in that water be free  
Come south of the border with me  
Jump in that water be free  
Come south of the border with me  
Come south of the border the border  
Come south of the border with me  
Come south of the border the border  
Come south of the border with me  
He got the mmm green eyes giving me signs  
That he wants to get to know my name hey  
I saw you looking from across the way  
And suddenly I'm glad I came  
Ay ven paraca quiero bailar toma mi mano  
Quiero sentir tu cuerpo mi estas sembrando  
Mmm green eyes taking your time  
And now we know we'll never be the same  
I love his hips curves he says the words  
Te amo mami huh te amo mami  
Don't wake up this love is like a dream  
So join me in this bed that I'm in  
Push up on me and sweat darling  
So I'm gonna put  
Huh  
My time in  
I won't stop until the angels sing  
Jump in that water be free  
Come south of the border with me  
Jump in that water be free  
Come south of the border with me  
Jump in that water be free  
Come south of the border with me  
Jump in that water be free  
Come south of the border with me  
Come south of the border the border  
Come south of the border with me  
Come south of the border the border  
Come south of the border with me  
Bardi uh  
You never live 'til you risk your life  
You want your shine you gotta get more ice  
Ice ice  
Am I your lover or I'm just your vice  
A little crazy but I'm just your type  
Okurrr  
You want the lips and the curves  
Need the whips and the furs  
And the diamonds I prefer  
In my closet his and hers hey  
He want that little mamacita margherita  
Margherita  
I think that Ed got a little jungle fever eh  
You are more than something boring  
Legs open and tongue out Michael Jordan uh  
Go exploring  
Woop woop  
In something foreign  
Skrrt skrrt  
Bust it up a rain forest it be pouring yeah  
Kiss me like you need me rub me like geenie  
Pull up to my spot a Lamborghini  
Coz you gotta see me never leave me  
You got a girl that could finally do it all  
Drop an album drop a baby  
But I never drop the ball uh  
So join me in this bed  
That I'm in  
Push up on me and sweat darling  
Yeah yeah  
So I'm gonna put  
Huh  
My time in  
I won't stop until the angels sing  
Jump in that water be free  
Come south of the border with me  
Come south of the border the border  
Come south of the border with me  
Jump in that water be free  
Come south of the border with me
