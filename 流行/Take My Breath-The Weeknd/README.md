万众期待之下，The Weeknd（威肯）于2021年8月6日发布了全新单曲《 **Take My Breath** 》，正式进入了下一个威肯时代。

《 _Take My Breath_ 》把复古合成器浪潮进行到底，迷幻的电子和复古声响，宛若听到了意大利电子音乐家Giorgio
Moroder以及素有迪斯科女王之称的Donna Summer的影子。

同时，《Take My Breath》也是The Weeknd即将到来的全新专辑首支先行单曲。The
Weeknd表示这张专辑是他一直都想做的一张专辑：“是什么让我每张专辑都很成功，尤其是这张，是因为我每次发完，都对制作下一张专辑感到兴奋。这种兴奋感意味着下一个项目对我来说就会是成功的，我想一直这样做下去。即使我开始接触不同的媒介或者不同的表达方式，音乐也一直在这里，我不会离开它。”

同时，网站还为大家提供了《[ **Blinding Lights**](Music-11016-Blinding-Lights-The-

### Take My Breath歌词：

I saw the fire in your eyes  
I saw the fire when I looked into your eyes  
You tell me things you wanna try  
I know temptation is the devil in disguise  
You risk it all to feel alive oh yeah  
You're offering yourself to me like you sacrifice  
You said you did this all the time  
Tell me you love me if I bring you to the light  
It's like a dream  
What she feels with me  
She loves to be on the edge  
Her fantasy is okay with me  
Then suddenly baby says  
Take my breath away  
And make it last forever babe  
Do it now or never babe  
Take my breath away  
Nobody does it better babe  
Bring me close to-  
Want me to hold onto you tight  
You pull me closer feel the heat between your thighs  
You're way too young to end your life  
Girl I don't wanna be the one who pays the price  
Ooh it's like a dream  
What she feels with me  
She loves to be on the edge  
Her fantasy is okay with me  
Then suddenly baby says  
Take my breath away  
And make it last forever babe  
Do it now or never babe  
Take my breath away  
Nobody does it better babe  
Bring me close to heaven babe  
Take my breath  
Oh oh-oh-ooh they'll see me  
Oh-ooh ooh-oh no  
Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh  
Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh  
Take my breath away  
Take my breath away  
And make it last forever babe  
Do it now or never babe  
Take my breath away  
Take my breath away  
Nobody does it better babe  
We'll be close to heaven babe  
Close  
Take my breath away  
Take my breath away breath away  
Take my breath away  
Take my breath away breath away  
Nobody does it better babe  
Bring me close to heaven babe  
Take my breath
