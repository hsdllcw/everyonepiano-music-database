### We Were Happy歌词：

We used to walk along the streets  
When the porch lights were shining bright  
Before I had somewhere to be  
Back when we had all night and we were happy  
I do recall a good while back we snuck into the circus  
You threw your arms around my neck back when I deserved it  
And we were happy  
When it was good baby it was good baby  
We showed 'em all up  
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark  
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday  
And we were happy  
We used to watch the sun go down on the boats in the water  
That's sorta how I feel right now  
And goodbye's so much harder 'cause we were happy  
When it was good baby it was good baby  
We showed 'em all up  
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark  
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday  
And we were happy  
We were happy  
Oh I hate those voices telling me I'm not in love anymore  
But they don't give me choices and that's what these tears are for  
'Cause we were happy we were happy  
When it was good baby it was good baby  
We showed 'em all up  
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark  
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm  
And you were gonna marry me  
And we were happy  
We were happy  
Oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
We were happy
