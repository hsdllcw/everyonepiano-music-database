### Dandelions歌词：

Maybe it's the way you say my name  
Maybe it's the way you play your game  
But it's so good I've never known anybody like you  
But it's so good I've never dreamed of nobody like you  
And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime  
And I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine  
'Cause I'm in a field of dandelions  
Wishing on every one that you'd be mine mine  
And I see forever in your eyes  
I feel okay when I see you smile smile  
Wishing on dandelions all of the time  
Praying to god that one day you'll be mine  
Wishing on dandelions all of the time all of the time  
I think that you are the one for me  
Cause it gets so hard to breathe  
When you're looking at me  
I've never felt so alive and free  
When you're looking at me  
I've never felt so happy  
And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime  
And I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine  
Cause I'm in a field of dandelions  
Wishing on every one that you'd be mine mine  
And I see forever in your eyes  
I feel okay when I see you smile smile  
Wishing on dandelions all of the time  
Praying to god that one day you'll be mine  
Wishing on dandelions all of the time all of the time  
Dandelion into the wind you go  
Won't you let my darling know  
Dandelion into the wind you go  
Won't you let my darling know that  
I'm in a field of dandelions  
Wishing on every one that you'd be mine mine  
And I see forever in your eyes  
I feel okay when I see you smile smile  
Wishing on dandelions all of the time  
Praying to god that one day you'll be mine  
Wishing on dandelions all of the time all of the time  
I'm in a field of dandelions  
Wishing on every one that you'd be mine mine
