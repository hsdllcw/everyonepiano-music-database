### Happier歌词：

We broke up a month ago  
Your friends are mine you know I know  
You've moved on found someone new  
One more girl who brings out the better in you  
And I thought my heart was detached  
From all the sunlight of our past  
But she's so sweet she's so pretty  
Does she mean you forgot about me  
Oh I hope you're happy  
But not like how you were with me  
I'm selfish I know I can't let you go  
So find someone great but don't find no one better  
I hope you're happy but don't be happier  
And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen  
An eternal love bulls**t you know you'll never mean  
Remember when I believed  
You meant it when you said it first to me  
And now I'm pickin' her apart  
Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart  
But she's beautiful she looks kind  
She probably gives you butterflies  
I hope you're happy  
But not like how you were with me  
I'm selfish I know I can't let you go  
So find someone great but don't find no one better  
I hope you're happy I wish you all the best really  
Say you love her baby  
Just not like you loved me  
And think of me fondly when your hands are on her  
I hope you're happy but don't be happier  
Ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh  
I hope you're happy  
Just not like how you were with me  
I'm selfish I know can't let you go  
So find someone great but don't find no one better  
I hope you're happy but don't be happier
