### Talking Body歌词：

Bed, stay in bed  
The feeling of your skin locked in my head  
Smoke, smoke me broke  
I don't care I'm down for what you want

Day drunk into the night  
Wanna keep you here  
Cause you dry my tears  
Yeah, summer lovin' and fights  
How it is for us  
And it's all because

Now if we're talking body  
You got a perfect one  
So put it on me  
Swear it won't take you long  
If you love me right  
[Explicit:] We fuck for life  
[Clean:] We love for life  
On and on and on

Now if we're talking body  
You got a perfect one  
So put it on me  
Swear it won't take you long  
If you love me right  
[Explicit:] We fuck for life  
[Clean:] We love for life  
On and on and on

Love, give me love  
Anything you want I'll give it up  
Lips, lips I kiss  
Bite me while I taste your fingertips

Day drunk into the night  
Wanna keep you here  
Cause you dry my tears  
Yeah, summer lovin' and fights  
How it is for us  
And it's all because

Now if we're talking body  
You got a perfect one  
So put it on me  
Swear it won't take you long  
If you love me right  
[Explicit:] We fuck for life  
[Clean:] We love for life  
On and on and on

Now if we're talking body  
You got a perfect one  
So put it on me  
Swear it won't take you long  
If you love me right  
[Explicit:] We fuck for life  
[Clean:] We love for life  
On and on and on

(Uh uh)  
Bodies!  
Our baby making bodies we just use for fun  
Bodies!  
Let's use them up 'til every little piece is gone  
(Let's go)  
On and on and on  
(Let's go)  
On and on  
(Let's go)  
(Oohhh)

Now if we're talking body  
You got a perfect one  
So put it on me  
Swear it won't take you long  
If you love me right  
[Explicit:] We fuck for life  
[Clean:] We love for life  
On and on and on

Now if we're talking body  
You got a perfect one  
So put it on me  
Swear it won't take you long  
If you love me right  
[Explicit:] We fuck for life  
[Clean:] We love for life  
On and on and on

Now if we're talking body  
Put it on me  
If you love me right  
[Explicit:] We fuck for life  
[Clean:] We love for life  
On and on and on

Now if we're talking body  
You got a perfect one  
So put it on me  
Swear it won't take you long  
If you love me right  
[Explicit:] We fuck for life  
[Clean:] We love for life  
On and on and on  
Hey...
