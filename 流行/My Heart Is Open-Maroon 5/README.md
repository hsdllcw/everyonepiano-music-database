### My Heart Is Open歌词：

I know you're scared  
I can feel it  
It's in the air,  
I know you feel that too  
But take a chance on me  
You won't regret it, no  
One more "no"  
and I'll believe you  
I'll walk away  
and I will leave you be  
And now's the last time  
you'll say no,  
say no to me  
It won't take me long  
to find another lover  
But I want you  
I can't spend another minute  
getting over loving you  
If you don't ever say yeah  
Let me hear you say yeah  
Wanna hear you say yeah yeah yeah  
Until my heart is open  
Now you gotta say yeah  
Let me hear you say yeah  
Wanna hear you say yeah yeah yeah  
Wanna hear you say  
Wanna hear you say  
Wanna hear you say  
Yes, yes, yes, yes  
Yes, yes, yes, yes  
Yes, yes, yes,  
It's just a moment going sea-saw  
Don't be afraid  
to give your heart to me  
And if you do,  
I know that I won't let you down, no  
Yeah, so hand it over,  
trust me with your love  
I'll do anything you want me to  
Cause I can't breath  
until I see your face  
Oh and I don't need time  
to find another love  
But I want you  
I can't spend another minute  
getting over loving you  
If you don't ever say yeah  
Let me hear you say yeah  
Wanna hear you say yeah yeah yeah  
Until my heart is open  
Now you gotta say yeah  
Let me hear you say yeah  
Wanna hear you say yeah yeah yeah  
Wanna hear you say  
Wanna hear you say  
Wanna hear you say  
Yes, yes, yes, yes  
Yes, yes
