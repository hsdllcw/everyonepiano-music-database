### Girls Like歌词：

[Tinie Tempah:]  
All the girls like, said I was the man  
All I ever needed was a plan  
Tell J.K that I'm still rolling  
Yeah, tell Russell I'm a brand  
Yeah, bust that skank  
Ain't nobody messing with the gang  
Might take a flight out for the weekend, yeah  
And go Cannes cause I can  
Go low, go low, everybody get low  
Had a couple hits and a couple solos  
Now I got a couple BRITs and a couple MOBOs  
Dropped "Pass Out", everybody loco  
I was dropping off the mandem in my Polo  
Now I'm with the mandem at the polo  
I could make a honey give away her last Rolo  
And I say sure, yo, you know how it goes  
All the girls like

[Zara Larsson:]  
I know what boys like  
I know what they want  
They want that good thing  
They wanna get some  
(All the girls like)  
I know what boys like  
I know what they want  
So go ahead and prove me right  
That's what girls like

[Tinie Tempah:]  
Yeah, Roley on the wrist, that's me, me  
Man of the year, I'm fleeky  
Heard a couple man wanna be me  
Them man can't be Titty  
Tell 'em only winners are allowed  
No diggidy, no diggiy-doubt  
I was getting blowed before girls were putting out  
Told them I was gonna blow back when I was in the south  
Go low, go low, everybody go low  
Since she want me, she don't want the CoCo  
So I made her sing it back like she was Moloko  
And I got a Merc, I ain't got a Volvo  
Used to have a black Nokia Sirocco  
Now everywhere I go, people want a photo  
I could make a honey give away her last Rolo  
And I say sure, yo, you know how I roll  
All the girls like

[Zara Larsson:]  
I know what boys like  
I know what they want  
They want that good thing  
They wanna get some  
(All the girls like)  
I know what boys like  
I know what they want  
So go ahead and prove me right  
That's what girls like

Don't need me a guy who's a friend  
Better pick me up in a Benz  
I like cruising around the West End  
No Netflix and chill, that's dead  
(All the girls like)  
Every day you ride your friends  
(All the girls like)  
I don't need your money for my rent  
(All the girls like)  
I'm not an 8.9, I'm a 10  
(All the girls like)  
What's the code to your Wi-Fi again?

(All the girls like)  
I know what boys like  
I know what they want  
They want that good thing  
They wanna get some  
(All the girls like)  
I know what boys like  
I know what they want  
(All the girls like)  
So go ahead and prove me right  
That's what girls like

[Tinie Tempah:]  
All the girls like, said I was the man  
All I ever needed was a plan  
Tell J.K that I'm still rolling  
Yeah, tell Russell I'm a brand  
Yeah, bust that skank  
Ain't nobody messing with the gang  
Might take a flight out for the weekend, yeah  
And go Cannes cause I can  
Go low, go low, everybody get low  
Had a couple hits and a couple solos  
Now I got a couple BRITs and a couple MOBOs  
Dropped "Pass Out", everybody loco  
I was dropping off the mandem in my Polo  
Now I'm with the mandem at the polo  
I could make a honey give away her last Rolo  
And I say sure, yo, you know how it goes  
All the girls like

[Zara Larsson:]  
I know what boys like  
I know what they want  
(All the girls like)  
I know what boys like  
I know what they want  
(All the girls like)  
I know you, I know you want the good thing  
(All the girls like)  
I know what boys like  
I know what they want
