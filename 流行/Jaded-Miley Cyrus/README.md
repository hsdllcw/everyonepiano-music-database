### Jaded歌词：

I don't wanna call and talk too long  
I know it was wrong but never said I was sorry  
Now I've had time to think it over  
We're much older and the bone's too big to bury  
Oh isn't it a shame that it ended like that  
Said goodbye forever but you never unpacked  
We went to Hell but we never came back  
I'm sorry that you're jaded  
I could've taken you places  
You're lonely now and I hate it  
I'm sorry that you're jaded  
You're not even willing to look at your part  
You just jump in the car and head down to the bar 'til you're blurry  
Don't know when to stop so you take it too far  
And I don't know where you are  
And I'm left in the dark 'til I'm worried  
Ooh and it hurts me  
And it's a ******* shame that it ended like that  
You broke your own arm but you'd never say that  
We went to Hell but we never came back  
I'm sorry that you're jaded  
Jaded  
I could've taken you places  
Places  
You're lonely now and I hate it  
I'm sorry that you're jaded  
I won't lie it won't be easy  
When somebody new is on your body  
I'll change my number but keep your t-shirt  
I don't mind it's torn up and faded  
I'm sorry that you're jaded  
Jaded  
I could've taken you places  
Places  
You're lonely now and I hate it  
I'm sorry that you're jaded  
I'm sorry that you're jaded
