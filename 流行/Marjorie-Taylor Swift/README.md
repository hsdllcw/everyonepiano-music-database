**Marjorie** 是由Taylor
Swift录唱的一首歌曲，被收录在她的第九张录音室专辑《Evermore》，歌曲延续了Folklore里的轻柔治愈的曲调，Taylor徐徐缓缓唱来真的很美妙，仿佛进入到那种无忧无虑的境地，只身置于其中，美轮美奂。

如果说Epiphany这首歌是写给Taylor父亲的父亲，也就是她的祖父。那么 _Marjorie_ 是写给母亲的母亲，也就是她的外祖母。

### Marjorie歌词：

Never be so kind  
You forget to be clever  
Never be so clever  
You forget to be kind  
And if I didn't know better  
I'd think you were talking to me now  
If I didn't know better  
I'd think you were still around  
What died didn't stay dead  
What died didn't stay dead  
You're alive you're alive in my head  
What died didn't stay dead  
What died didn't stay dead  
You're alive so alive  
Never be so polite  
You forget your power  
Never wield such power  
You forget to be polite  
And if I didn't know better  
I'd think you were listening to me now  
If I didn't know better  
I'd think you were still around  
What died didn't stay dead  
What died didn't stay dead  
You're alive you're alive in my head  
What died didn't stay dead  
What died didn't stay dead  
You're alive so alive  
The autumn chill that wakes me up  
You loved the amber skies so much  
Long limbs and frozen swims  
You'd always go past where our feet could touch  
And I complained the whole way there  
The car ride back and up the stairs  
I should've asked you questions  
I should've asked you how to be  
Asked you to write it down for me  
Should've kept every grocery store receipt  
'Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me  
Watched as you signed your name Marjorie  
All your closets of backlogged dreams  
And how you left them all to me  
What died didn't stay dead  
What died didn't stay dead  
You're alive you're alive in my head  
What died didn't stay dead  
What died didn't stay dead  
You're alive so alive  
And if I didn't know better  
I'd think you were singing to me now  
If I didn't know better  
I'd think you were still around  
I know better  
But I still feel you all around  
I know better  
But you're still around
