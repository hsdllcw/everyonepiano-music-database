### Who歌词：

Lauv：  
Outlines of new eyes and visions of you  
Girl I think I need a minute  
To figure out what is what isn't  
These choices and voices they're all in my head  
Sometimes you make me feel crazy  
Sometimes I swear I think you hate me like yeah  
I need a walk I need a walk  
I need to get outta here  
'Cause I need to know  
Lauv/BTS：  
Who are you  
'Cause you're not the girl I fell in love with baby  
Who are you  
'Cause something has changed you're not the same I hate it  
Oh oh-oh I'm sick of waiting for love love  
Oh oh-oh I know that you're not the one one  
BTS：  
Feelin' hypnotized by the words that you said  
Don't lie to me I just get in my head  
When the morning comes you're still in my bed  
But it's so so cold  
Who are you  
'Cause you're not the girl I fell in love with  
Lauv/BTS：  
Who are you  
'Cause you're not the girl I fell in love with baby  
Who are you  
'Cause something has changed you're not the same I hate it  
Oh oh-oh I'm sick of waiting for love love  
Oh oh-oh I know that you're not the one one
