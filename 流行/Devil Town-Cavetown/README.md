### Devil Town歌词：

Life's alright in devil town  
They're right no one's gonna catch us now  
Dad has bought a new car now  
We're fine no one's gonna catch us now  
You said something dumb again  
She's mad at least that's what they say  
Mum and daddy aren't in love  
That's fine I'll settle for two birthdays  
Devil town is colder in the summertime  
I'll lose my mind at least another thousand times  
Hold my hand tight we'll make it another night  
I still get a little scared of something new  
But I feel a little safer when I'm with you  
Falling doesn't feel so bad  
When I know you've fallen this way too  
We're all dead in devil town  
That's fine 'cause nothing's gonna scare us now  
We're all in our dressing gowns mine's white  
And stripy yours is green and brown  
I forgot my name again  
I think that's something worth remembering  
Spiders in your favourite shoes  
Just leave them be 'cause they're more scared of you  
Devil town is colder in the summertime  
I'll lose my mind at least another thousand times  
Hold my hand tight we'll make it another night  
I still get a little scared of something new  
But I feel a little safer when I'm with you  
Falling doesn't feel so bad  
When I know you've fallen this way too  
It's lovely in the evening time but  
Every time I close my eyes the  
Sunshine gets a little dimmer  
Now the clouds fall down  
I sink my teeth into my fingers  
Blossom swims across the river  
How do you feel so proud  
Every time I close my eyes the  
Colours fade and change inside my mouth  
It's all too loud  
I sink my teeth into my fingers  
Blood forms branches in the water  
Devil town is colder in the summertime  
So I'll stay inside  
Devil town is colder in the summertime  
I'll lose my mind at least another thousand times  
Hold my hand tight we'll make it another night  
I still get a little scared of something new  
But I feel a little safer when I'm with you  
Falling doesn't feel so bad  
When I know you've fallen this way too
