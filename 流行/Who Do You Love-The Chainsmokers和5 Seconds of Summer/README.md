**Who Do You Love双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Who Do You Love_ 是由美国电子音乐组合烟鬼组合The Chainsmokers联手澳洲偶像男团5 Seconds Of
Summer制作的歌曲，于2019年2月7日发行。

烟鬼组合在创作和制作两方面都做得十分精致，作为一个EDM组合，他们的强项其实并不是对EDM曲风的革命性开拓和创造。他们更像是一个流行小清新的EDM组合，注重的是作品的旋律性，音色的入耳度，整个氛围的舒适与体验，以及最重要的流行性。专注于音乐独特口味的打造外，烟鬼还偏好发掘小众歌手，找到自己音乐在人声方面的支点，用许多绿叶，来衬托自己红红火火的EDM。所以，在烟鬼身上可以看到“庸众”崛起的场面，所谓“庸众”并非贬义，而是指那些暂时没有获得更多关注的实力派。

### Who Do You Love歌词：

Yeah  
Found cigarettes in your Fendi coat  
Even though you don't even smoke  
Always changin' your access codes  
Yeah I can tell you no one knew  
Yeah you've been actin' so conspicuous  
You flip it on me say I think too much  
You're movin' different when we're makin' love  
Baby tell me tell me  
Who do you love do you love now  
I wanna know the truth whoa  
Who do you love do you love now  
I know it's someone new  
You ain't gotta make it easy where you been sleepin'  
This s**t is keepin' me up at night just admit it  
Who do you love do you love now  
I wanna know I wanna know who  
Now now who do you who do you love love yeah  
Now now who do you who do you love now oh  
Now now who do you who do you you yeah  
I wanna know I wanna know who  
You keep switchin' your alibi  
Stutterin' when you reply  
You can't even look me in the eye  
Ooh I can tell I know you're lyin'  
'Cause you've been actin' so conspicuous  
You flip it on me say I think too much  
You're movin' different when we're makin' love  
So baby tell me tell me  
Who do you love do you love now
