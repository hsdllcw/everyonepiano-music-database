**The Last Time双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_The Last Time_ 是爱尔兰摇滚乐队The Script的歌曲。The Script把他们自己的音乐风格定义为“Celtic
Soul”，其实，在他们的音乐当中，这两种元素都不是十分明显。他们继承了凯尔特音乐的一大优点就是流畅旋律，另一方面，从演唱方式上来看，The
Script个别的歌儿确实有着Soul和Urban音乐的味道，当然，这是和Danny O'Donoghue的嗓音特点密不可分的。

### The Last Time歌词：

Why's it so hard to look me in the eye  
Playing with that cross that's on your chain  
I know you only ever bite your lip  
When it's something you're afraid to say  
Is this the last time that I lay my eyes upon you  
Is this the last time that I ever watch you leave  
This is the last thing I would have done to you  
This is the last thing that I thought you'd do to me  
We said that it would last  
But how come it's the last time  
I'm tryna hold your hand but feeling like my hand's tied  
You said we'd be forever  
Now you never invite me mind  
You said that it would last  
But how come it's the last time  
You practiced this many times before  
But I guess you get it right today  
Leaving that ring I gave you in the drawer  
But you taking every single part of me  
Is this the last time that I lay my eyes upon you  
Is this the last time that I ever watch you leave  
This is the last thing I would have done to you  
This is the last thing that I thought you'd do to me  
We said that it would last  
But how come it's the last time  
I'm tryna hold your hand but feeling like my hand's tied  
You said we'd be forever now you never invite me mind  
You said that it would last  
But how come it's the last time Oh  
I think of the first kiss  
Your lips on the first night  
Whoa whoa  
I think of the first kiss  
Your lips on the first night  
Whoa whoa  
Ooh  
You said that it would last but how come it's the last time  
I'm tryna hold your hand but feeling like my hand's tied  
Mmm  
We are said we'd be forever  
Now you never invite me mind ooh  
We said that it would last  
But how come it's the last time Oh ooh  
I think of the first kiss  
Your lips on the first night  
Whoa  
First night  
I think of the first kiss  
Your lips on the first night  
Whoa whoa oh  
You said that it would last  
But how come it's the last time
