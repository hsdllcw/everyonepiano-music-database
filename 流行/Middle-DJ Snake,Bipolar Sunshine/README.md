### Middle歌词：

Staring at two different views on your window ledge  
Coffee has gone cold, it's like time froze  
There you go wishing, floating down our wishing well  
It's like I'm always causing problems, causing hell  
I didn't mean to put you through this, I can tell  
We're gonna sweep this under the carpet

I hope that I can turn back the time  
To make it all alright, all alright for us  
I'll promise to build a new world for us two  
With you in the middle

(you in the middle)  
(you in the middle)

Lying down beside you. What's going through your head?  
The silence in the air felt like my soul froze  
Am I just overthinking feelings I conceal  
This gut feeling I'm tryna get off me as well  
I hope we find our missing pieces and just chill  
We're gonna sweep it under the carpet

I hope that I can turn back the time  
To make it all alright, all alright for us  
I'll promise to build a new world for us two  
With you in the middle

(you in the middle)  
(you in the middle)  
(with you)  
(you)

(thank the children)  
(just thank the children)  
(you)  
(thank the children)  
(just thank the children)
