### New Rules歌词：

One one one  
Talkin' in my sleep at night  
Makin' myself crazy  
Out of my mind out of my mind  
Wrote it down and read it out  
Hopin' it would save me  
Too many times too many times  
Oh he makes me feel like nobody else  
Nobody else  
But my love he doesn't love me  
So I tell myself I tell myself  
One don't pick up the phone  
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone  
Two don't let him in  
You have to kick him out again  
Three don't be his friend  
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning  
And if you're under him you ain't getting over him  
I got new rules I count 'em  
I got new rules I count 'em  
I gotta tell them to myself  
I got new rules I count 'em  
I gotta tell them to myself  
I keep pushin' forwards  
But he keeps pullin' me backwards  
Nowhere to turn no way  
Nowhere to turn no  
Now I'm standing back from it  
I finally see the pattern  
I never learn I never learn  
But my love he doesn't love me  
So I tell myself I tell myself  
I do I do I do  
One don't pick up the phone  
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone  
Two don't let him in  
You have to kick him out again  
Three don't be his friend  
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning  
And if you're under him you ain't getting over him  
I got new rules I count 'em  
I got new rules I count 'em  
I gotta tell them to myself  
I got new rules I count 'em  
I gotta tell them to myself  
Practice makes perfect  
I'm still tryna learn it by heart  
I got new rules I count 'em  
Eat sleep and breathe it  
Rehearse and repeat it 'cause I  
I got new I got new I got new  
One don't pick up the phone  
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone  
Two don't let him in  
You have to kick him out again  
Three don't be his friend  
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning  
And if you're under him you ain't getting over him  
I got new rules I count 'em  
I got new rules I count 'em  
Oh whoa-oh  
I gotta tell them to myself  
I got new rules I count 'em  
Baby you know I count 'em  
I gotta tell them to myself  
Don't let him in don't let him in  
Don't don't don't don't  
Don't be his friend don't be his friend  
Don't don't don't don't  
Don't let him in don't let him in  
Don't don't don't don't  
Don't be his friend don't be his friend  
Don't don't don't don't  
You gettin' over him
