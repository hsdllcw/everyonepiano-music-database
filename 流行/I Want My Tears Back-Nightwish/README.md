### I Want My Tears Back歌词：

I want my tears back  
The treetops the chimneys the snowbed stories winter grey  
Wildflowers those meadows of heaven wind in the wheat  
A railroad across waters the scent of grandfatherly love  
Blue bayous Decembers moon through a dragonfly's wings  
Where is the wonder where's the awe  
Where's dear Alice knocking on the door  
Where's the trapdoor that takes me there  
Where the real is shattered by a mad march hare  
Where is the wonder where's the awe  
Where are the sleepless nights I used to live for  
Before the years take me  
I wish to see  
The lost in me  
I want my tears back  
I want my tears back now  
A ballet on a grove still growing young all alone  
A rag doll a best friend the voice of Mary Costa  
Where is the wonder where's the awe  
Where's dear Alice knocking on the door  
Where's the trapdoor that takes me there  
Where the real is shattered by a mad march hare  
Where is the wonder where's the awe  
Where are the sleepless nights I used to live for  
Before the years take me  
I wish to see  
The lost in me  
Where is the wonder where's the awe  
Where are the sleepless nights I used to live for  
Before the years take me  
I wish to see  
The lost in me  
I want my tears back  
I want my tears back now  
Where is the wonder where's the awe  
Where are the sleepless nights I used to live for  
Before the years take me  
I wish to see  
The lost in me  
Where is the wonder where's the awe  
Where are the sleepless nights I used to live for  
Before the years take me  
I wish to see  
The lost in me  
I want my tears back  
I want my tears back now
