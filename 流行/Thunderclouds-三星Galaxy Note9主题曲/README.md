### Thunderclouds歌词：

Sia：  
All I need is one  
One old man is enough  
Babe you got it wrong  
Please turn your fears into trust to trust  
Sia/Labrinth：  
Where'd the love go  
When all is said and done  
Hey now I got your hands in the air  
I'ma go through your stuff  
Where'd the love go  
You put the running into run  
You asking me to stay  
But I never met a girl I could trust  
Labrinth/Sia：  
You're sayin' those words like you hate me now  
Wo wo oah  
Our house is burning when you're raised in hell  
Wo wo oah  
Here in the ashes your soul cries out  
A a ah  
Don't be afraid of these thunderclouds  
These thunderclouds oh no  
These thunderclouds oh no no  
Labrinth：  
All I need is love  
All I need is a word  
All I need is us  
You turned nouns into verbs to verbs  
Labrinth/Sia：  
Where'd the love go  
When all is said and done  
Hey now put your hands in the air  
I'mma go through your stuff  
Where'd the love go  
You put the running into run  
You're asking me to stay  
But I never met a man I could trust  
Babe  
Sia/Both：  
You're sayin' those words like you hate me now  
Our house is burning when you're raising hell  
Here in the ashes your soul cries out  
But don't be afraid of these thunderclouds  
These thunderclouds oh no  
These thunderclouds oh no no  
These thunderclouds oh no  
These thunderclouds oh no no  
Sia：  
These thunderclouds  
These thunderclouds  
These thunderclouds  
Ohh
