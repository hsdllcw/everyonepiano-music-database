### Homecoming歌词：

Yeah.  
And you say Chi city,  
Chi city, Chi city  
Comin home again.  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Cause I’m coming home again  
I'm in home again  
I met this girl when I was three years old  
And what I loved most she had so much soul  
She said, excuse me little homie, I know you don’t know me, but  
My name is Wendy and, I like to blow trees and,  
From that point I never blow her off  
Niggaz come from outta town I like to show her off  
They like to act tough, she like to tow em off  
And make em straighten up they (act/hat), cause she know they soft  
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown  
And at night time my face lit up, so astounding  
I told her in my heart is where she always be  
She never mess with entertainers cause they always leave  
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me  
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me  
I guess that’s why last winter she got so cold on me  
She said, 'Ye keep making that, keep making that platinum and gold for me  
Comin home again.  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Cause I’m coming home again  
I'm in home again  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Cause I’m coming home again  
Maybe we can start again  
But if you really care for her  
Then you would have never hit the airport to follow your dream  
Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her  
It always seems like she talking about me  
She said you left your kids and they just like you  
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you  
But they just not you, and I just got through  
Talking bout what niggaz tryin' to do, just not new  
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong  
I guess you never know what you got till its gone  
I guess this is why I’m here and I can't come back home  
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home  
Every interview I’m representing you making you proud  
Reach for the stars so if you fall you land on a cloud  
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around,  
And if you don’t know by now, I’m talking about Chi town,  
Comin home again.  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Cause I’m coming home again  
I'm in home again  
Baybe, do you remember when?  
Fireworks at Lake Michigan  
Oooh, now I’m coming home again  
I'm in home again  
Baby, do you remember when?  
Fireworks at Lake Michigan  
Oooh, now I’m coming home again  
Maybe we can start again  
I'm in home again  
Maybe we can start again
