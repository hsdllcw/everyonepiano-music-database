The Winner Takes It All歌词：

  
I don't wanna talk我不想谈  
About the things we've gone through关於刚刚发生的事  
Though it's hurting me尽管那伤害了我  
Now it's history但那已成了历史  
I've played all my cards我打出了每一张牌  
And that's what you've done too你也一样  
Nothing more to say再也无话可说  
No more ace to play再也没有王牌  
The winner takes it all赢家通吃  
The loser standing small beside the victory输家卑微的站在 胜利旁边  
That's her destiny那是他的命运  
I was in your arms躺在你怀里  
Thinking I belonged there认为我属於那里  
I figured it made sense我尝试找到意义  
Building me a fence在我面前筑起一道篱  
Building me a home筑成一个家  
Thinking I'd be strong there以为我会很坚强  
But I was a fool但我真是傻  
Playing by the rules一切都照规矩在玩  
The gods may throw a dice众神丢了个骰子  
Their minds as cold as ice他们的内心冷酷如冰  
And someone way down here在下面的某个凡人  
Loses someone dear失去了心爱的人  
The winner takes it all胜者拿走一切  
The loser has to fall输家一败涂地  
It's simple and it's plain那是理所当然  
Why should I complain我能抱怨什麼  
But tell me does she kiss但是，告诉我她吻你的时候  
Like I used to kiss you?像我吻你一样吗？  
Does it feel the same感觉一样吗？  
When she calls your name?当她呼唤你名字的时候  
Somewhere deep inside在内心深处  
You must know I miss you你一定知道我很想你  
But what can I say但我还能说什麼  
Rules must be obeyed游戏规则必须遵守  
The judges will decide法官即将宣判  
The likes of me abide我得服从判决  
Spectators of the show看表演的观众  
Always staying low总是保持冷静  
The game is on again游戏再度登场  
A lover or a friend是爱人还是朋友  
A big thing or a small是大或是小  
The winner takes it all赢家通吃，胜者为王  
I don't wanna talk我不想谈  
If it makes you feel sad如果那使你感到悲伤  
And I understand而我明白  
You've come to shake my hand你会前来和我握手  
I apologize我向你致歉  
If it makes you feel bad看到我如此紧张  
Seeing me so tense缺乏自信  
No self-confidence但你可以看到  
But you see赢家通吃  
The winner takes it all胜者为王  
The winner takes it all... 胜者为王
