**Money** 是韩国女子演唱组合BLACKPINK成员LISA演唱的一首英语歌曲，收录于其首张专辑《LALISA》中，2021年9月10日发行。

这是一首简约又干练的嘻哈歌曲。 一方面延续了BLACKPINK以往的音乐风格，另一方面也展露了LISA作为SOLO歌手的鲜明个人风格。
极具中毒性的铜管乐和富有力量的钢琴声贯穿全曲 ，直白的歌词和后半部分的dance break将歌曲氛围戏剧性地推向高潮。

### Money歌词：

It's the end of the month  
And the weekend  
Imma spend this check  
Everything on me yeah  
Imma tip myself  
Imma spend it on myself  
Imma drop it like it's pouring  
Imma pour it on myself  
Check check check  
Check that money making bank account number  
That's that shiz that's never getting bounced on ya  
Bish I do the money dance
