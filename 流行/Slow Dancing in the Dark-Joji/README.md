### Slow Dancing in the Dark歌词：

I don't want a friend  
I want my life in two  
Waiting to get there  
Waiting for you  
Waiting for you  
When I'm around slow dancing in the dark  
Don't follow me, you'll end up in my arms  
You done made up your mind  
You done made up your mind  
Give me reasons we should be complete  
You should be with him, I can't compete  
You looked at me like I was someone else  
Can't you see?  
I don't wanna slow dance  
In the dark  
Dark  
When you gotta run  
Just hear my voice in you  
Shutting me out  
Doing so great  
When I'm around slow dancing in the dark  
Don't follow me, you'll end up in my arms  
You done made up your mind  
You done made up your mind  
Can't you see?  
I don't wanna slow dance  
In the dark  
Dark  
In the dark  
In the dark  
Dark
