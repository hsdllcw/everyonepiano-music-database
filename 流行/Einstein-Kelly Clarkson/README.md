### Einstein歌词：

Simple math  
Our love divided by the square root of pride  
Multiply your lies plus time  
I'm going out of my mind  
It was heavy when I finally figured it out alone  
I didn't get it's the first time  
Don't think I've been so blind  
And I may not be Einstein but I know  
Dumb plus dumb equals you  
Dumb plus dumb equals you  
Dumb plus dumb equals you, you  
Even had the nerve to flirt with her in front of my face  
Here's your keys, your bags, your clothes,now get out of my place  
You say I'm crazy, now we're happy  
Is that supposed to comfort me?  
I didn't get it's the first time  
Don't think I've been so blind  
Yeah I may not be Einstein but I know  
Dumb plus dumb equals you  
Dumb plus dumb equals you  
Dumb plus dumb equals you, you  
All of your promises plus  
A thousand apologies just  
Take out the pain and let it leaves us  
With nothing at all, no, nothing at all  
You can stop wasting my time  
Without you I'm just fine  
Why did it take me so long to figure it out  
Dumb plus dumb equals you  
Equals you, yeah  
I didn't get it's the first time  
Don't think I've been so blind  
Yeah I may not be Einstein but I know  
Dumb plus dumb equals you  
Dumb plus dumb equals you  
Simple math  
Our love divided by the square root of pride  
Multiply your lies plus time  
I'm going out of my mind  
And I may not be Einstein but I know  
Dumb plus dumb equals you
