### What Dreams Are Made Of歌词：

Hey now  
Hey now

Hey now  
Hey now

Have you ever seen such a beautiful night?  
I could almost kiss the stars for shining so bright  
When I see you smiling, I go  
Oh oh oh  
I would never want to miss this  
'cause in my heart I know what this is

[Chorus]  
Hey now  
Hey now  
This is what dreams are made of  
Hey now  
Hey now  
This is what dreams are made of  
I've got somewhere I belong  
I've got somebody to love  
This is what dreams are made of

(Hey now)  
(Hey now)

Have you ever wondered what life is about?  
You could search the world and never figure it out  
You don't have to sail the oceans  
No no no  
Happiness is no mystery it's  
Here now it's you and me

[Chorus]

Open your eyes  
(This is what dreams are made of)  
shout to the sky  
(This is what dreams are made of)

Then I see u smiling, I go  
Oh oh oh  
Yesterday my life was duller  
Now everything's Technicolor

[Chorus:]  
(Hey now)  
(Hey now)  
Hey now  
This is what dreams  
This is what dreams are made of  
Hey now  
Hey now  
This is what dreams are made of  
I've got somewhere I belong  
I've got somebody to love  
This is what dreams are made of  
(Hey now)  
(Hey now)  
Hey now  
This is what dreams  
This is what dreams are made of
