### Made You Look歌词：

I could have my Gucci on  
I could wear my Louis Vuitton  
But even with nothing on  
Bet I made you look  
I made you look  
I'll make you double take  
Soon as I walk away  
Call up your chiropractor  
Just in case your neck break  
Ooh  
Tell me whatcha whatcha whatcha gonna do-ooh  
'Cause I'm 'bout to make a scene  
Double up that sunscreen  
I'm 'bout to turn the heat up gonna make your glasses steam  
Ooh  
Tell me whatcha whatcha whatcha gonna do-ooh  
When I do my walk walk  
I can guarantee your jaw will drop drop  
'Cause they don't make a lot of what I got got  
Ladies if you feel me this your bop bop  
Bop bop bop  
I could have my Gucci on  
Gucci on  
I could wear my Louis Vuitton  
But even with nothing on  
Bet I made you look  
I made you look  
Yeah I look good in my Versace dress  
Take it off  
But I'm hotter when my morning hair's a mess  
Cause even with my hoodie on  
Bet I made you look  
I made you look  
Mhm hm hm  
And once you get a taste  
Woo  
You'll never be the same  
This ain't that ordinary this that 14 karat cake  
Ooh  
Tell me whatcha whatcha whatcha gonna do-ooh-ooh  
When I do my walk walk  
I can guarantee your jaw will drop drop  
'Cause they don't make a lot of what I got got  
Ladies if you feel me this your bop bop  
Bop bop bop  
I could have my Gucci on  
Gucci on  
I could wear my Louis Vuitton  
But even with nothing on  
Bet I made you look  
Said I made you look  
Yeah I look good in my Versace dress  
Take it off  
But I'm hotter when my morning hair's a mess  
'Cause even with my hoodie on  
Bet I made you look  
Said I made you look
