### When the Beat Drops Out歌词：

When the beat drops out  
and the people gone  
we still be there, still be there  
for me child.

When the lights go out  
and the morning comes  
we still be there, still be there  
for me child

When the beat drops out...

Life, happens you're making plans  
flying highing shaking Hands  
a song will write you, you don't write it  
I, didn't mean to fall in love  
was rhythm thar created if  
I was running, we collide it

Baseline, I will always make times,  
I just wanna know that feelings in your heart for me  
Baseline, after all the great times,  
I just wanna know that feelings in your heart...

When the beat drops out  
and the people gone  
we still be there, still be there  
for me child.

When the lights go out  
and the morning come  
we still be there, still be there  
for me child

When the beat drops out  
and the people gone  
we still be there, still be there  
for me child.

When the lights go out  
and the morning come  
we still be there, still be there  
for me child

When the beat drops out...

With you, I found a new way to live  
I see an alternative  
Now we started, we can stop it  
I, I didn't mean to fall in love  
last thing I was thinking of  
was you and me but, we collide it

Baseline, I will always make times,  
I just wanna know that feelings in your heart for me  
Baseline, after all the great times,  
I just wanna know that feelings in your heart...

When the beat drops out  
and the people gone  
we still be there, still be there  
for me child.

When the lights go out  
and the morning come  
we still be there, still be there  
for me child

When the beat drops out  
and the people gone  
we still be there, still be there  
for me child. (we still be there for me)

When the lights go out (when the lights go out)  
and the morning come (morning come)  
we still be there, still be there  
for me child (we still be there for me)

When the beat drops out...  
when the beat drops out...  
when the beat drops out...
