收录在她的第五张专辑Stronger里。
专辑辑Stronger的灵感来源包括许多很有影响力的歌手，包括、蒂娜•特纳、电台司令乐队、雪儿•克罗和艾瑞莎•弗兰克林等，并请来曾与惠特妮•休斯顿合作的制作人Rodney
Jerkins来操刀制作。Kelly表示道：“这次专辑将会是我近年来作品最接近心灵的一次，你知道我要表达的是什么吗？就好似电台司令乐队的另类说唱尽管是非主流，但是它们依然让人产生共鸣。雪儿•克罗也是这样，她是一个非常能够渲染乐迷心灵的歌手，总会创作出一些富有韵律的流行摇滚乐。”

### The War Is Over歌词：

I watch the days rush by me like a river  
I shouldn't wait, but I'm scared to touch the water  
I let the phone ring, why won't you believe me (believe me)  
I wait for silence, takes a lot not to answer

All I have to say is  
You don't deserve me, you don't deserve me  
I'm finally walking away  
'Cause you don't deserve me, and you're not worthy

And I won't let you pull me in  
Because I know you're gonna win  
(The war is over) but the war is over (the war is over)  
And I won't fight you anymore  
I've never been so sure  
(The war is over) 'cause the war is over

I used to let you paint a pretty picture  
You got me caught up with your, you're my girl forever  
So I forgive you, it felt good when you'd hold me  
Yeah you owned me  
Now you wish you had really known me

All I have to say is you don't deserve me, you don't deserve me  
I'm finally walking away, 'cause you'll only hurt me  
And you're not worthy

And I won't let you pull me in  
Because I know you're gonna win  
(The war is over) but the war is over (the war is over)  
And I won't fight you anymore  
I've never been so sure  
(The war is over) 'cause the war is over

This is not my surrender  
I'm not running for cover  
I'm right here, I know you see me  
But your words no longer defeat me  
In the night, when you're lonely  
You remember how much you miss me  
So you call, but I swear  
You can try a million times, you'll get the same answer

All I have to say is you don't deserve me, you don't deserve me  
I'm finally walking away, 'cause you'll only hurt me  
And you're not worthy

And I won't let you pull me in  
Because I know you're gonna win  
(The war is over) but the war is over (The war is over)

The war is over  
The war is over  
The war is over  
The war is over  
The war is over  
The war is over  
The war is over
