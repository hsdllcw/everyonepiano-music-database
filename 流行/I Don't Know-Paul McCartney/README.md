**I Don't Know双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_I Don't Know_ 是原披头士乐队成员，英国最具影响力之一音乐家Paul
McCartney发布的歌曲。年少轻狂时的摇滚梦想已成往事，岁月的洗礼荡涤了青春的虚火，年老的McCartney，还是在最适合他的优雅与悦耳中，找回了他的位置。爵士乐的编排，伦敦交响乐团适度古典的点缀，再加上McCartney深情醇厚的歌声使曲子更加柔和、典雅、高贵。

### I Don't Know歌词：

I got crows at my window dogs at my door  
I don't think I can take anymore  
What am I doing wrong I don't know  
My brother told me life's not a pain  
That was right when it started to rain  
Where am I going wrong I don't know  
But it's alright sleep tight  
I will take the strain  
You'll find love of mine  
You will feel no pain  
When I see trouble at every turn  
I've got so many lessons to learn  
What am I doing wrong I don't know  
Now what's the matter with me  
Am I right am I wrong  
Now I started to see  
I must try to be strong  
I've tried to love you best as I can  
But you know that I'm only a man  
Why am I going wrong I don't know  
Ooh yeah  
Oh woah woah woah mhmm  
But it's alright sleep tight  
I will take the strain  
Yeah you'll find little love of mine  
You will feel no pain  
I got crows at my window dogs at my door  
But I don't think I can take anymore  
What am I doing wrong I don't know  
Now what's the matter with me I don't know I don't know  
What's the matter with me I don't know I don't know  
What's the matter with me I don't know I don't know
