### Cheerleader歌词：

When I need motivation  
My one solution is my queen  
'cause she' stay strong yeah yeah  
she is always in my corner  
right there when I want her  
all these other girls are tempting  
but I'm empty when you're gone  
and they say  
do you need me  
do you think I'm pretty  
do I make you feel like cheating..  
And I'm like no, not really 'cause  
Oh I think  
that I found myself a cheerleader  
she is always right there  
when I need her  
oh I think that I found myself  
a cheerleader  
she is always right there  
when I need her  
She walks like a model  
she grants my wishes  
like a genie in a bottle yeah yeah  
'cause I'm the wizard of love  
And I got the magic wand  
all these other girls are tempting  
but I'm empty when you're gone  
and they say  
do you need me?  
do you think I'm pretty  
Do I make you feel like Cheating  
and I'm like no, not really cause'  
Oh I think that I found myself  
a cheerleader  
she is always right there  
when I need her  
oh I think that I found myself  
a cheerleader  
she is always right there  
when I need her  
She gives me love and affection  
baby did I mention,  
you're the only girl for me  
no I don't need a next one  
mama loves you too,  
she thinks I made the right selection  
now all that's left to do  
is just for me to pop the question  
Oh I think that I found myself  
a cheerleader  
She is always right there  
when I need her  
Oh I think that I found myself  
a cheerleader  
She is always right there  
when I need her
