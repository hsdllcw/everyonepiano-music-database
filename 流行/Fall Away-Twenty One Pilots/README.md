### Fall Away歌词：

I don't wanna fall fall away  
I don't wanna fall fall away  
I'll keep the lights on in this place  
'Cause I don't wanna fall fall away  
I don't wanna fall fall away  
I don't wanna fall fall away  
I'll keep the lights on in this place  
'Cause I don't wanna fall fall away  
I disguise  
And I will lie  
And I will take my precious time  
As the days spent away  
As I stand in line  
And I die as I wait as I wait on my crime  
And I'll try to delay what you make of my life  
But I don't want your way  
I want mine  
I'm dying and trying  
But believe me I'm fine  
But I'm lying  
I'm so very far from fine  
And I can feel the pull begin  
I feel my conscience wearing thin  
And my skin  
It will start to break up and fall apart  
I don't wanna fall fall away  
I don't wanna fall fall away  
I'll keep the lights on in this place  
'Cause I don't wanna fall fall away  
Every time I feel selfish ambition  
Is taking my vision  
And my crime is my sentence  
Repentance is taking commission  
It's taking a toll  
On my soul  
I'm screaming submission and  
I don't know if I am dying or living  
'Cause I will save face  
For name's sake  
Abuse grace  
Take aim to obtain a new name  
And a newer place  
But my name is lame  
I can't walk and I ain't the same  
And my name became  
A new destiny to the grave  
And I I can feel the pull begin  
Feel my conscience wearing thin  
And my skin  
It will start to break up and fall apart  
I don't wanna fall fall away  
I don't wanna fall fall away  
I'll keep the lights on in this place  
'Cause I don't wanna fall fall away
