### Oh My God歌词：

I ain't got too much time to spare  
But I'll make time for you to show how much I care  
Wish that I would let you break my walls  
But I'm still spinning out of control from the fall  
Boy you give good love I won't lie  
It's what keeps me comin' back even though I'm terrified  
I know that it's wrong  
But I want to have fun  
Mh yeah mh yeah  
I know that it's wrong  
But I want to have fun  
Mh yeah mh yeah  
Oh my God I can't believe it  
Out of all the people in the world oh  
What is the likelihood of jumping out of my life and into your arms  
Maybe baby I'm just losing my mind  
'Cause this is trouble but it feels right  
Teetering on the edge of Heaven and Hell is a battle I cannot fight  
I'm a fool but they all think I'm blind  
I'd rather be a fool than leave myself behind  
I don't have to explain myself to you  
I'm a grown woman and I do what I want to do  
I know that it's wrong  
But I want to have fun  
Mh yeah mh yeah  
I know that it's wrong  
But I want to have fun  
Mh yeah mh yeah  
Oh my God I can't believe it  
Out of all the people in the world oh  
What is the likelihood of jumping out of my life and into your arms  
Maybe baby I'm just losing my mind  
'Cause this is trouble but it feels right  
Teetering on the edge of Heaven and Hell is a battle I cannot fight  
"Lord don't let me" I say "Lord don't let me"  
I say "Lord don't let me let me down"  
Oh Lord  
"Lord don't let me" I say "Lord don't let me"  
I say "Lord don't let me let me down"  
Don't let me let myself down  
"Lord don't let me" I say "Lord don't let me"  
I say "Lord don't let me let me down"  
Oh my God  
"Lord don't let me" I say "Lord don't let me"  
I say "Lord don't let me let me down"  
Oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
Oh my God I can't believe it  
Out of all the people in the world oh  
What is the likelihood of jumping out of my life and into your arms  
Maybe baby I'm just losing my mind  
'Cause this is trouble but it feels right  
Teetering on the edge of Heaven and Hell is a battle I cannot fight  
"Lord don't let me" I say "Lord don't let me"  
I say "Lord don't let me let me down"  
I know that it's wrong but I want to have fun  
"Lord don't let me" I say "Lord don't let me"  
I say "Lord don't let me let me down"  
Mh yeah mh yeah  
"Lord don't let me" I say "Lord don't let me"  
I say "Lord don't let me let me down"  
I know that it's wrong but I want to have fun  
"Lord don't let me" I say "Lord don't let me"  
I say "Lord don't let me let me down"  
Mh yeah mh yeah
