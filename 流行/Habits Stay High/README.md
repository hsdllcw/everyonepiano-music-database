**Habits (Stay High)** 原由瑞典女歌手Tove Lo演唱。然在2021年1月，韩国歌手Jisoo重新演绎了此曲。

《Habits (Stay
High)》背后的故事大多都体现在歌曲歌词上。歌词讲述了一个女人尝试以任何方式麻木自身伤痛的方式去摆脱一些关系和内心的痛苦。而歌曲类似于卡嗒声的流行乐节奏和具有震撼力的副歌则足以让这场关于酒醉的体验听上去优美感伤，而不像是一场悲剧。

### Habits (Stay High)歌词：

I eat my dinner in my bathtub  
Then I go to sex clubs  
Watching freaky people getting it on  
It doesn't make me nervous  
If anything I'm restless  
Yeah I've been around and I've seen it all  
I get home I got the munchies  
Binge on all my Twinkies  
Throw up on the tub  
Then I go to sleep  
And I drank up all my money  
Tasted kinda lonely  
You're gone and I gotta stay  
High all the time  
To keep you off my mind  
High all the time  
To keep you off my mind  
Spend my days locked in a haze  
Tryna forget you babe  
I fall back down  
Gotta stay high all my life  
To forget I'm missing you  
Pick up daddies at the playground  
How I spent my time  
Losing up the frown  
Make them feel alive  
Or make it fast and greasy  
I'm on my way to easy  
You're gone and I gotta stay  
High all the time  
To keep you off my mind  
High all the time  
To keep you off my mind  
Spend my days locked in a haze  
Tryna forget you babe  
I fall back down  
Gotta stay high all my life  
To forget I'm missing you  
Staying in my play pretend  
Where the fun it got no end  
Can't go home alone again  
Need someone to numb the pain  
Staying in my play pretend  
Where the fun it got no end  
Can't go home alone again  
Need someone to numb the pain  
You're gone and I gotta stay  
High all the time  
To keep you off my mind  
High all the time  
To keep you off my mind  
Spend my days locked in a haze  
Tryna forget you babe  
I fall back down  
Gotta stay high all my life  
To forget I'm missing you
