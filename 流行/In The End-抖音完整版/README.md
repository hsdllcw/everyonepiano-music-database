### In The End歌词：

Fleurie：  
It starts with one  
All I know  
It's so unreal  
Watch you go  
Fleurie：  
I tried so hard and got so far  
But in the end it doesn't even matter  
I had to fall to lose it all  
But in the end it doesn't even matter  
Jung Youth/Fleurie：  
One thing I don't know why  
It doesn't even matter how hard you try  
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme  
To remind myself of a time when I tried so hard  
In spite of the way you were mockin' me  
Actin' like I was part of your property  
Remembering all the times you fought with me  
I'm surprised it got so far  
Things aren't the way they were before  
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore  
Not that you knew me back then  
But it all comes back to me in the end  
You kept everything inside  
And even though I tried it all fell apart  
What it meant to me will eventually  
Be a memory of a time when I  
Fleurie：  
I tried so hard and got so far  
But in the end it doesn't even matter  
I had to fall to lose it all  
But in the end it doesn't even matter  
Jung Youth：  
One thing I don't know why  
It doesn't even matter how hard you try  
Keep that in mind  
I designed this rhyme to explain in due time  
All I know  
Time is a valuable thing  
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings  
Watch it count down to the end of the day  
The clock ticks life away  
It's so unreal  
You didn't look out below  
Watch the time go right out the window  
Tryin' to hold on they didn't even know  
I wasted it all just to watch you go  
I kept everything inside  
And even though I tried it all fell apart  
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory  
Of a time when I tried so hard
