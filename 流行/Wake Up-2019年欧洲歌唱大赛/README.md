### Wake Up歌词：

I wake up every night  
I can't find anyone to pray  
Somewhere in the light  
Changing all up  
I'm afraid on the side  
Looking out for the lines to say  
Someone has the light  
Feeding our fire  
I came to fight  
I came to fight over you  
Don't want your lies  
Don't want your lies I need truth  
I came to fight  
I came to fight over you  
No one will cry  
No one will cry if it's true  
I'll wait for the sign  
I can't find anyone to stay  
But there's something in the light  
Saving our lives  
I came to fight  
I came to fight over you  
Don't want your lies  
Don't want your lies I need truth  
I came to fight  
I came to fight over you  
No one will cry  
No one will cry if it's true  
And I can't face you now  
No I won't break you down  
If I can find you I won't hide you  
It's not what I do  
I came to fight  
I came to fight over you  
Don't want your lies  
Don't want your lies I need truth  
I came to fight  
I came to fight over you  
No one will cry  
No one will cry if it's true
