**Catch Me双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Catch Me_ 是Demi Lovato第二张个人录音室专辑《Here We Go
Again》的第六首曲目。专辑于2009年7月21日发行。和第一张专辑《Don't Forget》不同的是，这专辑中Demi没有再和Jonas
Brothers合作撰写，而是邀请到其他音乐人，譬如John Mayer，E. Kidd Bogart，Toby Gad，Gary
Clark等人合力打造。Demi还邀请了The Academy Is...的主唱William Beckett一同创作了《For the Love of a
Daughter》，但是由于这首歌描述了Demi和生父之间逐渐陌生的感情，考虑到Demi的受众粉丝大多都是青少年，因此没有收录在这张专辑中，而后这首歌被重新制作，最终收录在Demi的第三张专辑《Unbroken》中。

### Catch Me歌词：

Before I fall too fast  
Kiss me quick but make it last  
So I can see how badly this will hurt me when you say goodbye

Keep it sweet, keep it slow  
Let the future pass and don't let go  
But tonight I could fall too soon under this beautiful moonlight

But you're so hypnotizing  
You've got me laughing while I sing  
You've got me smiling in my sleep  
And I can see this unraveling  
Your love is where I'm falling  
But please don't catch me...

See this heart won't settle down  
Like a child running scared from a clown  
I'm terrified of what you do  
My stomach screams just when I look at you

Run far away so I can breathe  
Even though you're far from suffocating me  
I can't set my hopes too high  
'Cause every "Hello" ends with a "Goodbye"

But you're so hypnotizing  
You've got me laughing while I sing  
You've got me smiling in my sleep  
And I can see this unraveling  
Your love is where I'm falling  
But please don't catch me...

So now you see why I'm scared  
I can't open up my heart without a care  
But here I go, it's what I feel  
And for the first time in my life I know it's real

But you're so hypnotizing  
You've got me laughing while I sing  
You've got me smiling in my sleep  
And I can see this unraveling  
Your love is where I'm falling  
So please don't catch me

If this is love please don't break me  
I'm giving up so just catch me
