### Met Him Last Night歌词：

Demi Lovato：  
Late at night I'm sippin' as you pass me by  
Red or white you pour another say "It's fine"  
I don't believe in you  
I I don't believe  
'Cause I know just who you do  
Demi Lovato：  
I've seen the devil yeah I met him last night  
Had conversations yeah I think he's all right  
Seem kinda funny yeah he's kinda my type  
Yeah yeah yeah  
I've seen the devil yeah I met him last night  
One conversation now he's spendin' the night  
I think I love him though I know it ain't right  
Ariana Grande：  
You got me f**ked up I won't let this happen again  
This the last time you won't take advantage of my innocence  
I don't believe in you  
I I don't believe  
Disguised but I see right through  
I I see it right through  
Demi Lovato：  
I've seen the devil yeah I met him last night  
Had conversations yeah I think he's all right  
Seem kinda funny yeah he's kinda my type  
Yeah yeah yeah  
I've seen the devil yeah I met him last night  
One conversation now he's spendin' the night  
I think I love him though I know it ain't right  
Demi Lovato：  
How could I ever believe him  
The one that could be so deceivin'  
Boy you were my only vice I never feel this way  
Won't be no hostage I'm leavin'  
Boy you just gave me a reason  
No one ever thought I'd be the one  
No one ever thought I'd be the one to fall  
Watch me bounce before I give you my all  
So I promise tonight is the last call  
Ariana Grande：  
I don't believe in you  
I I don't believe  
Disguised but I see right through  
I I see it right through  
Demi Lovato：  
I've seen the devil yeah I met him last night  
Had conversations yeah I think he's all right  
Seem kinda funny yeah he's kinda my type  
Yeah yeah yeah  
I've seen the devil yeah I met him last night  
One conversation now he's spendin' the night  
I think I love him though I know it ain't right
