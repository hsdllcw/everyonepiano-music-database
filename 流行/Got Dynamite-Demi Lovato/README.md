### Got Dynamite歌词：

I can't take your hand and  
Lead you to the water  
I can't make you feel what you don't feel  
But you know you wanna  
Find out how to crack me  
Log in try to hack me

Underneath the surface  
There's so much you need to know  
And you might feel like you're drowning  
But that's what I need to let go

Tell me what you got to break down the walls  
You just might need dynamite  
Tell me what you got to break down the walls  
Kick senseless, my defenses  
Tell me what you're gonna do  
I need you to light the fuse  
Tell me what you got to break down the walls  
You just might need dynamite

Got dynamite?  
Got dynamite?

I can't paint this picture  
Just so you can hang it  
I can't wait for you to understand  
If you just don't get it  
Find out how to crack me  
Log in try to hack me

Underneath the surface  
There's so much you need to know  
And you might feel like you're drowning  
But that's what I need to let go

Tell me what you got to break down the walls  
You just might need dynamite  
Tell me what you got to break down the walls  
Kick senseless, my defenses  
Tell me what you're gonna do  
I need you to light the fuse  
Tell me what you got to break down the walls  
You just might need dynamite

When the walls come crashing down  
I hope you're standing right in front of me  
Where my past lies all around  
'Cause all you need to save me is to intervene  
And make the walls come crashing down

Got got dynamite

Tell me what you got to break down the walls  
You just might need dynamite  
Tell me what you got to break down the walls  
Kick senseless, my defenses  
Tell me what you're gonna do  
I need you to light the fuse  
Tell me what you got to break down the walls  
You just might need dynamite

Got dynamite?  
Got dynamite?  
Got dynamite?  
Got dynamite?
