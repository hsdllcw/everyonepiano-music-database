**Angie** 是英国摇滚乐乐队The Rolling Stones的歌曲。滚石乐队(The Rolling
Stones)的名字取自于前辈艺人Muddy
Waters的一首蓝调歌曲“Rollin‘Stones”。是音乐史上最杰出的乐队之一，流行乐史上最重要的乐队之一，摇滚史上最有影响的乐队之一，现场演出表现最棒的乐队之一，是摇滚史上最成功和最长寿的乐队之一。他们的即兴节奏编配极为适合现场演出中的尽情挥洒，而他们狂野不羁的身体语言则几乎为后世所有的摇滚乐现场演出定出了规范，摇滚融合蓝调的粗犷风格。“滚石”具有更强的攻击性和叛逆色彩。

### Angie歌词：

Angie, Angie, when will those clouds all disappear?  
Angie, Angie, where will it lead us from here?  
With no loving in our souls and no money in our coats  
You can't say we're satisfied  
But Angie, Angie, you can't say we never tried  
Angie, you're beautiful, but ain't it time we said good-bye?  
Angie, I still love you, remember all those nights we cried?  
All the dreams we held so close seemed to all go up in smoke  
Let me whisper in your ear:  
Angie, Angie, where will it lead us from here?  
Oh, Angie, don't you weep, all your kisses still taste sweet  
I hate that sadness in your eyes  
But Angie, Angie, ain't it time we said good-bye?  
With no loving in our souls and no money in our coats  
You can't say we're satisfied  
But Angie, I still love you, baby  
Ev'rywhere I look I see your eyes  
There ain't a woman that comes close to you  
Come on Baby, dry your eyes  
But Angie, Angie, ain't it good to be alive?  
Angie, Angie, they can't say we never tried
