### Faking It歌词：

Pray to God but I'm feeling like he's going deaf  
Now when I lean on you and I got nothing left  
Hey I've been wanting to call you  
Tell you that I'm sorry  
Same old f**king story everybody sings  
And I say I'm okay but I guess I'm a liar  
You say you're okay but I saw that you liked it  
2 AM and faded I know that's when you like it  
Know that's when you miss me  
Know that's when you crying  
Why you why you why you checking if you're over it  
Why you why you say let go if you're still holding it  
Just a little bit better at faking it than me baby  
Just a little bit better at faking it than me baby  
Why you why you why you checking if you're over it  
Why you why you say let go if you're still holding it  
Just a little bit better at faking it than me baby  
Just a little bit better at faking it than me baby  
Nowadays I'm just a b**ch to everybody else  
F**k you and you  
I don't need no shoulders I'm good crying by myself  
F**k you too  
Moving on to chokers you know I still adore ya  
An unrequited love is just a lover's hell  
And I say I'm okay but I guess I'm a liar  
You say you're okay but I saw that you liked it  
2 AM and faded I know that's when you like it  
Know that's when you miss me  
Know that's when you crying  
Why you why you why you checking if you're over it  
Why you why you say let go if you're still holding it  
Just a little bit better at faking it than me baby  
Just a little bit better at faking it than me baby  
Why you why you why you checking if you're over it  
Why you why you say let go if you're still holding it  
Just a little bit better at faking it than me baby  
Just a little bit better at faking it than me baby  
I'm not gonna act like I don't love ya baby  
'Cause deep in my mind girl I know I do true  
Try to search after the water not well  
But I can't find a girl that lives close like you no  
I done made millions of dollars  
But I'm still alone 'til I come home back to you yah  
I remember all of the times  
We were parked by your house  
And laughed out on your avenue  
Whoa you can't front  
You're a stone cold diva yaah  
I had to get counseling from my moms  
She's a heartbreak teacher oh yah  
Remember that time  
I put those pepperonis on your face  
Made you a creature  
Now I think about you  
Every single time I eat pizza ohh  
Why you why you why you checking if you're over it  
Why you why you say let go if you're still holding it  
Just a little bit better at faking it than me baby  
Just a little bit better at faking it than me baby  
Why you why you why you checking if you're over it  
Why you why you say let go if you're still holding it  
Just a little bit better at faking it than me baby  
Just a little bit better at faking it than me baby  
Why you holding me  
Why you holding me  
Oh she killed that sh*t  
She was killing it  
That was hard bruh  
Every person could get that high  
But she killed that  
Go Lani go Lani
