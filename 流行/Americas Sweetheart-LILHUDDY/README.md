### America's Sweetheart歌词：

I feel so alone in a crowded place  
Every conversation feels so fake  
Everything I touch always seems to break  
I get so depressed when I hear your name  
Oh-oh-oh  
I don't really give a s**t if you stay  
I don't really give a s**t if you go  
I don't really give a s**t either way  
Either way I feel alone  
I don't really give a s**t if you stay  
I don't really give a s**t if you go  
I don't really give a s**t either way  
Either way I feel alone  
And here we are I'm the bad guy  
And you're America's sweetheart  
I won't even lie if you left me here  
I wouldn't even cry not one d**n tear  
And I'ma tell you somethin' you don't wanna hear  
I won't feel good until I disappear  
Oh-oh-oh  
I don't really give a s**t if you stay  
I don't really give a s**t if you go  
I don't really give a s**t either way  
Either way I feel alone  
Alone  
I don't really give a s**t if you stay  
I don't really give a s**t if you go  
I don't really give a s**t either way  
Either way I feel alone  
And here we are I'm the bad guy  
And you're America's sweetheart  
Oh-oh-oh  
I don't really give a s**t if you stay  
If you stay  
I don't really give a s**t if you go  
If you go  
I don't really give a s**t either way  
Either way  
Either way I feel alone  
Alone  
I just wanna say I feel so ashamed  
Ashamed  
Never really thought that you would let me go  
Let me go  
Now I gotta wake up in all this pain  
All this pain  
Every day I feel alone  
And here we are I'm the bad guy  
And you're America's sweetheart
