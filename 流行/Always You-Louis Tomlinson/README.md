### Always You歌词：

I went to Amsterdam without you  
And all I could do was think about you  
And oh I should've known  
I went to Tokyo to let it go  
Drink after drink but I still felt alone  
I should've known  
I went to so many places  
Looking for you in the faces  
I could feel it  
Oh I could feel it  
I'm wasting my time when it was always you always you  
Chasing the high but it was always you always you  
Should've never let you go oh oh  
Should've never let you go oh my baby  
Go oh oh oh oh oh  
I went from LAX to Heathrow  
Walk through my door but it felt nothing like home  
'Cause you're not home  
Waiting to wrap your legs around me  
And I know you hate to smoke without me and oh  
Now you know  
I'm wasting my time when it was always you always you  
Chasing the high but it was always you always you  
Should've never let you go oh oh  
Should've never let you go oh my baby  
Go oh oh oh oh oh  
Should've never let you go oh oh  
Should've never let you go oh my baby  
Go oh oh oh oh oh  
I went to so many places  
Looking for you in the faces  
I could feel it  
Oh I could feel it  
Wasting my time when it was always you always you  
I was chasing the high but it was always you always you  
Should've never let you go oh oh  
Should've never let you go oh my baby  
Go oh oh oh oh oh  
Should've never let you go oh oh  
Should've never let you go oh my baby  
Go oh oh oh oh oh  
My baby  
Oh my baby
