### We Wish You A Merry Christmas歌词：

We wish you a merry Christmas

We wish you a merry Christmas

We wish you a merry Christmas

And a happy New Year.

Glad tidings we bring To you and your kin;

Glad tidings for Christmas

And a happy New Year!

We want some figgy pudding

We want some figgy pudding

We want some figgy pudding

Please bring it right here!

Glad tidings we bring To you and your kin;

Glad tidings for Christmas

And a happy New Year!

We won't go until we get some

We won't go until we get some

We won't go until we get some

So bring it out here!

Glad tidings we bring To you and your kin;

Glad tidings for Christmas

And a happy New Year!

We wish you a merry Christmas

We wish you a merry Christmas

We wish you a merry Christmas

And a happy New Year.

Glad tidings we bring To you and your kin;

Glad tidings for Christmas And a happy New Year!
