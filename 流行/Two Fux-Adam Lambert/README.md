### Two Fux歌词：

I only trust my tarot cards  
Pink flamingos in my yard  
People think that I'm from Mars  
Whatever  
Only smoke that holy green  
High above the big machine  
Not attached to anything  
Whatever  
I got that magic you call A.D.D.  
Rep for them aliens  
Different like me  
If you think that what I do and how I live's too much  
I don't really really give two fux  
If you think that what I say and what I give ain't love  
I don't really really give two fux  
Here right here right here  
Namaste right here right here right here  
In the center of a crowded room  
I might as well be on the moon  
Searching for that one or two who get it  
See me talking to myself  
Cuz no one gets me like myself  
I've been this way since I was 12  
I get it  
I got that magic you call O.C.D.  
Rep for them aliens  
Different like me  
If you think that what I do and how I live's too much  
I don't really really give two fux  
If you think that what I say and what I give ain't love  
I don't really really give two fux  
Here right here right here  
Namaste right here right here right here  
One shot for my enemies  
In the end it ain't that deep  
Imma get my inner peace in leather  
If you think that what I do and how I live's too much  
I don't really really give two fux  
If you think that what I say and what I give ain't love  
I don't really really give two fux  
Here right here right here  
Namaste right here right here right here  
I don't care too far  
Here right here right here  
Namaste right here right here right here
