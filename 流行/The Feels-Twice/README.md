### The Feels歌词：

Boy I boy I boy I know  
I know you get the feels  
Boy I boy I boy I know  
Uh I'm so curious  
'Bout you boy wanna keep it cool  
But I know every time you move  
Got me frozen I  
Get so shy  
It's obvious  
Catching feels like butterflies  
If I say what's on my mind  
Would I hit bullseye  
Shoot  
I'm ready aim and fire  
Baby I  
Feel like cupid's alive  
Alive tonight  
Yeah tonight  
If your heart beats the same way let me know  
Cos I'm boom boom boom from head to toe and I  
I know love it is such a funny thing  
A mystery allure  
Gotta get to know you more  
Cos I I can feel a real connection  
A supernatural attraction-ah  
I got the feels for you yea yea yea yea  
You have stolen my heart oh yeah  
Never let it go oh oh no  
Never let it go oh oh oh  
Lightning straight to my heart oh yeah  
I got all the feels for sure  
Yeah I got all the feels for ya  
Boy I boy I boy I know  
I know I get the feels  
Boy I boy I boy I know  
I know you feel it too  
Sway in the moonlight  
Dance in the dark I  
I know that I caught your eye  
Are we on the same vibe I  
Wonder what's on your mind  
Cos you got me good and I wanna be ya boo  
If it's dumb well I wanna be a fool  
Underneath the neon lights bebe  
Electricity tonight bebe  
I know love it is such a funny thing  
A mystery allure  
Gotta get to know you more  
Cos I I can feel a real connection  
A supernatural attraction-ah  
I got the feels for you yea yea yea yea  
You have stolen my heart oh yeah  
Never let it go oh oh no  
Never let it go oh oh oh  
Lightning straight to my heart oh yeah  
I got all the feels for sure  
Yeah I got all the feels for ya  
Boy I boy I boy I know

Boy I boy I boy I know

You got my attention  
So what's your intention  
Yeah tell me baby what's the deal  
Oh one look and I know it baby my eyes reveal  
That you you you give me the feels  
You have stolen my heart oh yeah  
Never let it go oh oh no

Lightning straight to my heart oh yeah
