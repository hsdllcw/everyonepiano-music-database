### Location歌词：

Send me your location let's  
Focus on communicating  
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through  
Place to come through  
Send me your location  
Let's ride the vibrations  
I don't need nothing else but you  
At times I wonder why I fool with you  
But this is new to me this is new to you  
Initially I didn't wanna fall for you  
Gather my attention it was all for you so don't  
Take advantage don't leave my heart damaged  
To understand that things go a little bit better  
When you plan it oh  
Send me your location let's  
Focus on communicating  
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through  
Send me your location  
Let's ride the vibrations  
I don't need nothing else but you  
I don't wanna fall in love off of subtweets so  
Let's get personal  
I got a lot of cool spots that we can go  
Tell me what's the move and I got you  
I'm only acting like this 'cause I like you  
Just give me the vibe to slide then  
Oh I might make you mine by the night and  
Send me your location let's  
Focus on communicating  
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through  
Come through  
Send me your location  
Let's ride the vibrations  
I don't need nothing else but you  
Ride ride ride come and vibe with me tonight  
I don't need nothing else but you  
I don't need nothing else but you  
Ride ride ride come and vibe with me tonight  
I don't need nothing else but you  
Nothing else but you  
Do do do do do do  
Oh oh mmm mmm mmm mmm  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh mmm mmm mmm  
Do do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do do  
I don't need nothing else but you
