### Today歌词：

Today is the greatest  
Day I've ever known  
Can't live for tomorrow,  
Tomorrow's much too long  
I'll burn my eyes out  
Before I get out

I wanted more  
Than life could ever grant me  
Bored by the chore  
Of saving face

Today is the greatest  
Day I've never known  
Can't wait for tomorrow  
I might not have that long  
I'll tear my heart out  
Before I get out

Pink ribbon scars  
That never forget  
I tried so hard  
To cleanse these regrets  
My angel wings  
Were bruised and restrained  
My belly stings

Today is  
Today is  
Today is  
The greatest day

I want to turn you on  
I want to turn you on  
I want to turn you on  
I want to turn you

Today is the greatest  
Today is the greatest day  
Today is the greatest day  
That I have ever really known
