### Getaway Car歌词：

It was the best of times the worst of crimes  
I struck a match and blew your mind  
But I didn't mean it  
And you didn't see it  
The ties were black the lies were white  
In shades of grey in candlelight  
I wanted to leave him  
I needed a reason  
X marks the spot where we fell apart  
He poisoned the well I was lyin' to myself  
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned we were cursed  
We never had a shot gunshot in the dark  
You were drivin' the getaway car  
We were flyin' but we'd never get far  
Don't pretend it's such a mystery  
Think about the place where you first met me  
Ridin' in a getaway car  
There were sirens in the beat of your heart  
I shoulda known I'd be the first to leave  
Think about the place where you first met me  
In a getaway car oh-oh  
No they never get far oh-ahh  
No nothing good starts in a getaway car  
It was the great escape the prison break  
The light of freedom on my face  
But you weren't thinkin'  
And I was just drinkin'  
Well he was runnin' after us I was screamin' go go go  
But with three of us honey it's a sideshow  
And a circus ain't a love story  
And now we're both sorry we're both sorry  
X marks the spot where we fell apart  
He poisoned the well every man for himself  
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned we were cursed  
It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart  
You were drivin' the getaway car  
We were flyin' but we'd never get far  
Don't pretend it's such a mystery  
Think about the place where you first met me  
Ridin' in a getaway car  
There were sirens in the beat of your heart  
I shoulda known I'd be the first to leave  
Think about the place where you first met me  
In a getaway car oh-oh  
No they never get far oh-ahh  
No nothing good starts in a getaway car  
We were jet-set Bonnie and Clyde  
Until I switched to the other side  
To the other si-i-i-i-ide  
It's no surprise I turned you in  
'Cause us traitors never win  
I'm in a getaway car  
I left you in a motel bar  
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys  
That was the last time you ever saw me  
Drivin' the getaway car  
We were flyin' but we never get far don't pretend  
Don't pretend it's such a mystery  
Think about the place where you first met me  
Ridin' in a getaway car  
There were sirens in the beat of your heart should've known  
I shoulda known I'd be the first to leave  
Think about the place where you first met me  
In a getaway car oh-oh  
No they never get far oh-ahh  
No nothing good starts in a getaway car  
I was ridin' in a getaway car  
I was cryin' in a getaway car  
I was dyin' in a getaway car  
Said goodbye in a getaway car  
Ridin' in a getaway car  
I was cryin' in a getaway car  
I was dyin' in a getaway car  
Said goodbye in a getaway car
