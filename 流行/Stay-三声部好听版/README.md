### Stay歌词：

Rihanna：  
All along it was a fever  
A cold sweat hot-headed believer  
I threw my hands in the air said "Show me something"  
He said "If you dare come a little closer"  
Round and around and around and around we go  
Oh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know  
Not really sure how to feel about it  
Something in the way you move  
Makes me feel like I can't live without you  
And it takes me all the way  
I want you to stay  
Mikky Ekko：  
It's not much of a life you're living  
It's not just something you take it's given  
Round and around and around and around we go  
Oh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know  
Not really sure how to feel about it  
Something in the way you move  
Makes me feel like I can't live without you  
And it takes me all the way  
And I want you to stay  
Rihanna/Mikky Ekko：  
Ooh the reason I hold on  
Ooh 'cause I need this hole gone  
Funny you're the broken one  
But I'm the only one who needed saving  
'Cause when you never see the light  
It's hard to know which one of us is caving  
Not really sure how to feel about it  
Something in the way you move  
Makes me feel like I can't live without you  
And it takes me all the way  
I want you to stay  
Stay  
I want you to stay  
Ooh
