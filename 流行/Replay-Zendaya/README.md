### Replay歌词：

[Verse 1:]  
Make it stop  
Sound so good I just can't take no more  
Turn it down, turn it up  
I don't know, I don't know (know)  
But don't stop, don't move  
Just keep it there (right there)  
Keep it right there, keep it right there

I wanna put you on repeat, play you everywhere I go, e-e-everywhere I go, play
you everywhere I go  
Put you on repeat, play you everywhere I go, e-e-everywhere I go, play you
everywhere I go

[Chorus:]  
Yeah  
Wanna put this song on replay,  
I can listen to it all day,  
I can listen to you all day,  
Hear you all day  
Yeah  
Wanna put this song on replay,  
We can start all over again and again, yeah  
Wanna put this song on replay

[Verse 2:]  
Don't stop,  
Turn it on, turn it up, make it louder  
I don't wanna miss a single thing,  
I wanna hear every melody, yeah.  
B-b-b-b-beating, beating,  
Beating so loud, you can feel it (feel it)  
B-b-b-b-beating, beating, beating  
Beating for you

I wanna put you on repeat, play you everywhere I go, e-e-everywhere I go, play
you everywhere I go  
Put you on repeat, play you everywhere I go, e-e-everywhere I go, play you
everywhere I go

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]  
Feel it all, feel it all crashing down (down, down)  
I'm so lost, I'm so lost in your sound  
Yeah, wanna put this song on replay (put this song on replay) on replay  
Lis-listen to you all day, to you all day!

[Chorus]

Yeah [x2]
