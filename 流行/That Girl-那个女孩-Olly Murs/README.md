### That Girl歌词：

There's a girl but I let her get away  
It's all my fault cause pride got in the way  
And I'd be lying if I said I was OK  
About that girl the one I let get away  
I keep saying no  
This can't be the way we're supposed to be  
I keep saying no  
There's gotta be a way to get you close to me  
Now I know you gotta  
Speak up if you want somebody  
Can't let him get away oh no  
You don't wanna end up sorry  
The way that I'm feeling everyday  
No no no no  
There's no hope for the broken heart  
No no no no  
There's no hope for the broken  
There's a girl but I let her get away  
It's my fault cause I said I needed space  
I've been torturing myself night and day  
About that girl the one I let get away  
I keep saying no  
This can't be the way we're supposed to be  
I keep saying no  
There's gotta be a way to get you  
There's gotta be a way  
To get you close to me  
You gotta  
Speak up if you want somebody  
Can't let him get away oh no  
You don't wanna end up sorry  
The way that I'm feeling everyday  
No no no no  
There's no hope for the broken heart  
No no no no  
There's no hope for the broken  
No home for me  
No home cause I'm broken  
No room to breathe  
And I got no one to blame  
No home for me  
No home cause I'm broken  
About that girl  
The one I let get away  
So you better  
Speak up if you want somebody  
You can't let him get away no no  
You don't wanna end up sorry  
The way that I'm feeling everyday  
Don't you know  
No no no no  
There's no hope for the broken heart  
Don't you know  
No no no no  
There's no hope for the broken  
Oh  
You don't wanna lose at love  
It's only gonna hurt too much  
I'm telling you  
You don't wanna lose at love  
It's only gonna hurt too much  
I'm telling you  
You don't wanna lose at love  
Cause there's no hope for the broken heart  
That girl  
The one I let get away
