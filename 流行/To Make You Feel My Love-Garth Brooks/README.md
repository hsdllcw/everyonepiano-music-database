### To Make You Feel My Love歌词：

When the rain is blowing in your face  
And the whole world is on your case  
I could offer you a warm embrace  
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear  
And there is no one there to dry your tears  
I could hold you for a million years  
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet  
But I would never do you wrong  
I've known it from the moment that we met  
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue  
I'd go crawling down the avenue  
There ain't nothing that I wouldn't do  
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging on the rollin' sea  
Down on the highway of regret  
The winds of change are blowing wild and free  
But you ain't seen nothing like me yet

There's nothing that I wouldn't do

Go to the ends of the earth for you

Make you happy, make your dreams come true  
To make you feel my........ love
