### Dress歌词：

Our secret moments  
In your crowded room  
They've got no idea  
About me and you  
There is an indentation  
In the shape of you  
Made your mark on me  
A golden tattoo  
All of this silence and patience pining and anticipation  
My hands are shaking from holding back from you  
Ah ah ah  
All of this silence and patience pining and desperately waiting  
My hands are shaking from all this  
Ha ha ha ha  
Say my name and everything just stops  
I don't want you like a best friend  
Only bought this dress so you could take it off take it off  
Ha ha ha  
Carve your name into my bedpost  
Cause I don't want you like a best friend  
Only bought this dress so you could take it off take it off  
Ha ha ha  
Inescapabl  
I'm not even gonna try  
And if I get burned at least we were electrified  
I'm spilling wine in the bathtub  
You kiss my face and we're both drunk  
Everyone thinks that they know us  
But they know nothing about  
All of this silence and patience pining and anticipation  
My hands are shaking from holding back from you  
Ah ah ah  
All of this silence and patience pining and desperately waiting  
My hands are shaking from all this  
Ha ha ha ha  
Say my name and everything just stops  
I don't want you like a best friend  
Only bought this dress so you could take it off take it off  
Ha ha ha  
Carve your name into my bedpost  
Cause I don't want you like a best friend  
Only bought this dress so you could take it off take it off  
Ha ha ha ha  
Only bought this dress so you could take it off  
Ha ha ha  
Only bought this dress so you could take it off  
Flash back when you met me  
Your buzzcut and my hair bleached  
Even in my worst times  
You could see the best of me  
Flash back to my mistakes  
My rebounds my earthquakes  
Even in my worst light  
You saw the truth in me  
And I woke up just in time  
Now I wake up by your side  
My one and only my lifeline  
Now I woke up just in time  
Now I wake up by your side  
My hands are shaking and I can't explain this  
Ha ha ha ha  
Say my name and everything just stops  
I don't want you like a best friend  
Only bought this dress so you could take it off take it off  
Ha ha ha  
Carve your name into my bedpost  
Cause I don't want you like a best friend  
Only bought this dress so you could take it off take it off  
Ha ha ha  
There is an indentation  
In the shape of you  
Only bought this dress so you could take it off  
You made your mark on me golden tattoo  
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
