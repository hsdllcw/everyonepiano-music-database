### If I Ain't Got You歌词：

Some people live for the fortune  
Some people live just for the fame  
Some people live for the power, yeah  
Some people live just to play the game  
Some people think that the physical things  
Define what's within  
And I've been there before  
But that life's a bore  
So full of the superficial

[Chorus:]  
Some people want it all  
But I don't want nothing at all  
If it ain't you, baby  
If I ain't got you, baby  
Some people want diamond rings  
Some just want everything  
But everything means nothing  
If I ain't got you, yeah

Some people search for a fountain  
That promises forever young  
Some people need three dozen roses  
And that's the only way to prove you love them  
Hand me the world on a silver platter  
And what good would it be  
With no one to share  
With no one who truly cares for me

[Chorus:]  
Some people want it all  
But I don't want nothing at all  
If it ain't you, baby  
If I ain't got you, baby  
Some people want diamond rings  
Some just want everything  
But everything means nothing  
If I ain't got you, you, you  
Some people want it all  
But I don't want nothing at all  
If it ain't you, baby  
If I ain't got you, baby  
Some people want diamond rings  
Some just want everything  
But everything means nothing  
If I ain't got you, yeah

[Outro:]  
If I ain't got you with me, baby  
So nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing  
If I ain't got you with me, baby
