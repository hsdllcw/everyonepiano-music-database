**Half The World Away双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Half The World Away_ 是英国绿洲乐队（OASIS）的歌曲。组合沿袭了 Stones和 the Who的粗糙灰暗的形象，融合了
Beatles 的曲调并带有明显的英国抒情色彩的主题。他们将这一切用吉他的吼叫声串起来。而他们的挑衅式的讥笑可以和 Sex Pistols
的叛逆与Stone Rose 的傲慢自大媲美。是近十年来英国最受欢迎和最受评论家承认的乐队之一，他们在将英国的guitar-pop
推向顶峰的过程中起了不小的作用。该乐队于2009年8月底宣布解散。

### Half The World Away歌词：

I would like to leave this city  
This old town don't smell too prettyand  
I can feel the warning signs  
Running around my mind  
And when I leave this island  
I'll book myself into a soul asylum  
Cos I can feel the warning signs  
Running around my mind  
So here I go  
I'm still scratching around the same old hole  
My body feels young but my mind is very old  
So what do you say  
You can give me the dreams that are mine anyway  
You're half the world away  
Half the world away  
Half the world away  
I've been lost  
I've been found  
But I don't feel down  
And when I leave this planet  
You know I'd stay but I just can't stand it and  
I can feel the warning signs  
Running around my mind  
And if I could leave this spirit  
I'd find me a hole and I'll live in it and  
I can feel the warning signs running around my mind  
Here I go  
I'm still scratching around in the same old hole  
My body feels young but my mind is very old  
So what do you say  
You can give me the dreams that are mine anyway  
You're half the world away  
Half the world away  
Half the world away  
I've been lost  
I've been found  
But I don't feel down  
No I don't feel down  
No I don't feel down  
I don't feel down  
I don't feel down  
I don't feel down  
I don't feel down
