Shawn Mendes发布全新单曲《 **Wonder**
》，歌曲与他即将在12月4日发布的新专辑同名，这是一张揭开Mendes内心世界、人生旅程和梦想的诚意大作。

戏剧人声化的惊喜开场，给前奏营造了一种庞大的背景，仿佛是一片大海上的一粒粒水滴缓缓滴落，在此起彼伏的鼓点节奏中，Mendes舒适温润的声线又如这片大海中的一只小帆潜行。顷刻间，巨浪突起，小帆在重重迭起的波涛中历经磨练，到达了目的地。
Mendes还是一如既往地运用了他最擅长的成人抒情，这首歌曲的演绎，从前期的舒缓到后面的高潮，都呈现了对于“wonder”的想像，而戛然而止的结尾，像是一个谜底，等着我们去探索，找到wonder中的Neverland。

### Wonder歌词：

I wonder if I'm being real  
Do I speak my truth or do I filter how I feel  
I wonder wouldn't it be nice  
To live inside a world that isn't black and white  
I wonder what it's like to be my friends  
Hope that they don't think I forget about them  
I wonder I wonder  
Right before I close my eyes  
The only thing that's on my mind  
Been dreaming that you feel it too  
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you yeah  
I wonder what it's like  
I wonder what it's like to be loved by  
I wonder why I'm so afraid  
Of saying something wrong I never said I was a saint  
I wonder when I cry into my hands  
I'm conditioned to feel like it makes me less of a man  
And I wonder if some day you'll be by my side  
And tell me that the world will end up alright  
I wonder I wonder  
Right before I close my eyes  
The only thing that's on my mind  
Been dreaming that you feel it too  
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you yeah  
I wonder what it's like  
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you  
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you yeah  
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you yeah  
I wonder what it's like to be loved by  
Right before I close my eyes  
The only thing that's on my mind  
Been dreaming that you feel it too  
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you
