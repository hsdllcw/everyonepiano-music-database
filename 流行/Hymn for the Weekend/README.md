### Hymn for the Weekend 歌词：

[Intro: Beyoncé]  
And said drink from me, drink from me  
(Oh-ah-oh-ah)  
That we shoot across the sky  
Symphony  
That we shoot across the sky  
Pour on a...  
Drink from me, drink from me  
(Oh-ah-oh-ah)  
That we shoot across the sky  
Symphony  
(So high, so high)  
That we shoot across the sky  
[Verse 1: Chris Martin]  
Oh, angel sent from up above  
You know you make my world light up  
When I was down, when I was hurt  
You came to lift me up  
Life is a drink and love's a drug  
Oh now I think I must be miles up  
When I was a river dried up  
You came to rain a flood

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin & Beyoncé]  
And said drink from me, drink from me  
When I was so thirsty  
Pour on a symphony  
Now I just can't get enough  
Put your wings on me, wings on me  
When I was so heavy  
Soaring on symphony  
When I'm low, low, low, low

[Chorus: Chris Martin]  
I-Oh-I-Oh  
Got me feeling drunk and high  
So high, so high  
Oh-I-Oh-I-Oh  
Now I’m feeling drunk and high  
So high, so high  
(Woo)  
(Woo-ooo-ooo-woo)

[Verse 2: Chris Martin & Beyoncé]  
Oh, angel sent from up above  
I feel it coursing through my blood  
Life is a drink and your love's about  
To make the stars come out

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin & Beyoncé]  
Put your wings on me, wings on me  
When I was so heavy  
Soaring on symphony  
When I'm low, low, low, low

[Chorus: Chris Martin]  
I-Oh-I-Oh  
Got me feeling drunk and high  
So high, so high  
Oh-I-Oh-I-Oh  
I’m feeling drunk and high  
So high, so high

[Bridge: Beyoncé & Chris Martin]  
I-Oh-I-Oh  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la  
So high, so high  
I-Oh-I-Oh  
I'm feeling drunk and high  
So high, so high

[Outro: Beyoncé]  
That we shoot across the sky  
That we shoot across the...  
That we shoot across the sky  
That we shoot across the...  
That we shoot across the sky  
That we shoot across the...  
That we shoot across the sky  
That we shoot across the...  
That we shoot across the sky  
That we shoot across the...
