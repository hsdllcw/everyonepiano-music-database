She gotta move with her friend  
Heard she went back to her man  
Give a f**k ayy  
I just put a Wagen in the driveway you know I did  
When I shoot my shot it's the Kawhi way it's goin' in  
Me and lil' Sicko sittin' sideways breakin' tens  
Used to be an antisocial n***a now I'm makin' friends  
I just got a mansion out in Turks and it's a beachfront  
Okay
