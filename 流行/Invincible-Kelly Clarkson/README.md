Kelly
Clarkson在比赛过程中总演绎别人的歌。她的声音被人拿来和惠特妮•休斯顿、玛丽亚•凯莉作比较。虽然歌声风格多变，充满灵性，打动了亿万电视观众的心，但多少掩盖了一个事实：在唱功背后，她还是天赋甚好的原创音乐人。

### Invincible歌词：

You know I was broke down, I had hit the ground  
I was crying out, couldn't make no sound  
No one hears silent tears collecting  
You know I had lost hope, I was all alone  
Never been so low 'til you came along  
Teacher, I feel the dots connecting

Beat down on me, beat down like a waterfall  
Cause I can take on so much more than I had ever dreamed  
So beat down on me, beat down like a waterfall  
'Cause baby, I am ready to be free

Now I am invincible  
No, I ain't a scared little girl no more  
Yeah, I am invincible  
What was I running for  
I was hiding from the world  
I was so afraid, I felt so unsure  
Now I am invincible  
And I'm a perfect storm

Now I am a warrior, a shooting star  
You know I got this far, I had a broken heart  
No one hears silent tears collecting  
'Cause it's being weak that's strong  
In the truth I found  
I have courage now, I'm gonna shout it out  
Teacher, I feel the dots connecting

Beat down on me, beat down like a waterfall  
'Cause I can take on so much more than I had ever dreamed  
So beat down on me, beat down like a waterfall  
'Cause baby, I am ready to be free

Now I am invincible  
No, I ain't a scared little girl no more  
Yeah, I am invincible  
What was I running for  
I was hiding from the world  
I was so afraid, I felt so unsure  
Now I am invincible  
And I'm a perfect storm

I was running from an empty threat  
Of emptiness  
I was running from an empty threat  
That didn't exist  
I was running from an empty threat  
Of abandonment  
I was running from an empty threat  
That didn't exist

But now I am invincible  
No, I ain't a scared little girl no more  
Yeah, I am invincible  
What was I running for  
I was hiding from the world  
I was so afraid, I felt so unsure  
Now I am invincible  
And I'm a perfect storm

Now I am invincible  
No, I ain't a scared little girl no more  
Yeah, I am invincible  
What was I running for  
I was hiding from the world  
I was so afraid, I felt so unsure  
Now I am invincible  
And I'm a perfect storm
