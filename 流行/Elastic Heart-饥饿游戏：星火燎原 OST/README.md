### Elastic Heart歌词：

And another one bites the dust  
Oh why can I not conquer love  
And I might have thought that we were one  
Wanted to fight this war without weapons

And I wanted it, I wanted it bad  
But there were so many red flags  
Now another one bites the dust  
Yeah let's be clear, I'll trust no one

You did not break me  
I'm still fighting for peace

I've got thick skin and an elastic heart,  
But your blade it might be too sharp  
I'm like a rubberband until you pull too hard,  
I may snap and I move fast  
But you won't see me fall apart  
Cause I've got an elastic heart

I've got an elastic heart  
Yeah I've got an elastic heart

And I will stay up through the night  
Let's be clear, won't close my eyes  
And I know that I can survive  
I'll walk through fire to save my life

And I want it, I want my life so bad  
I'm doing everything I can  
Then another one bites the dust  
It's hard to lose a chosen one

You did not break me  
I'm still fighting for peace

I've got thick skin and an elastic heart,  
But your blade it might be too sharp  
I'm like a rubberband until you pull too hard,  
I may snap and I move fast  
But you won't see me fall apart  
Cause I've got an elastic heart  
[x3]

I've got an elastic heart
