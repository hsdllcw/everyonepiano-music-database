### First Time歌词：

We were lovers for the first time

Running all the red lights

The middle finger was our peace sign, yeah

We were sipping on emotions

Smoking and inhaling every moment

It was reckless and we owned it, yeah, yeah

We were high and we were sober

We were under, we were over

We were young and now I'm older

But I'd do it all again

Getting drunk on a train track

Way back, when we tried our first cigarettes

Ten dollars was a fat stack

I'd do it all again

Bought my jacket and a snapback

Your dance black heart was a Mayback

Three stacks on the playback

I'd do it all again

We were lovers on a wild ride

Speeding for the finish line

Come until the end of our time, yeah

Started off as a wildfire

Burning down the bridges to our empire

Our love was something they could admire, yeah, yeah

We were high and we were sober

We were under, we were over

We were young and now I'm older

But I'd do it all again

Getting drunk on a train track

Way back, when we tried our first cigarettes

Ten dollars was a fat stack

I'd do it all again

Bought my jacket and a snapback

Your dance black heart was a mayback

Three stacks on the playback

I'd do it all again
