**It'll Be Okay** 由加拿大男歌手Shawn Mendes演唱，于2021年12月1日发行。

Shawn以歌开始纪念与Camila恋情，同时也以歌来结束两人的爱情。恋爱时的耳鬓厮磨，分手时的脆弱难受，最终汇聚成这首《 _It'll Be Okay_
》。

安静旋律下流淌着的是那颗受伤，难以痊愈的心，某时某刻像是着魔般地想你，点点滴滴，妄想触及内心的柔软却难以释怀。Shawn磁性又富有张力的嗓音，缓缓低吟像是在自我询问，还爱吗，挣扎吗，甘心吗...也许吧，明天过后，曾经彼此熟悉的我们就要成为陌路人了，我们，终究是无法继续走下去了。

### It'll Be Okay歌词：

Are we gonna make it  
Is this gonna hurt  
Oh we can try to sedate it  
But that never works  
Yeah  
I start to imagine a world where we don't collide  
It's making me sick but we'll heal and the sun will rise  
If you tell me you're leaving I'll make it easy  
It'll be okay  
If we can't stop the bleeding  
We don't have to fix it we don't have to stay  
I will love you either way  
Ooh-ooh it'll be oh be okay  
Ooh-ooh  
Oh the future we dreamed of is fading to black  
Oh-oh oh-oh oh  
Oh there's nothing more painful  
Nothing more painful oh-woah  
Oh-woah  
I start to imagine a world where we don't collide  
And it's making me sick but we'll heal and the sun will rise  
If you tell me you're leaving I'll make it easy  
It'll be okay  
It'll be okay  
And if we can't stop the bleeding  
We don't have to fix it we don't have to stay  
Don't have to stay  
I will love you either way  
Ooh-ooh it'll be oh be okay  
Ooh-ooh  
I will love you either way  
It might be so sweet  
It might be so bitter  
I will love you either way  
It might be so sweet  
It might be so bitter  
Ooh-ooh  
Oh if the future we've dreamed of is fading to black  
I will love you either way
