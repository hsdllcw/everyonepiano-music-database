### Bad Decisions歌词:

[Verse 1]  
Boy, you know that you drive me crazy  
But it's one of the things I like  
Cause I know when you need it, baby  
That I got that, ooh ooh  
Let 'em keep, let 'em keep on talkin'  
But it don't matter what they say  
Cause you know when you hear me knockin'  
Gonna get that, ooh ooh

[Pre-Chorus]  
I've been doing stupid things  
Wilder than I've ever been  
You've become my favorite sin  
So let 'em keep, let 'em keep on talking  
That's right  
[Chorus]  
We got that hood love  
We got that good love  
We got that hot love  
We got that "I don't give a what" love  
We got that one life  
Gimme that all night  
We got that Bonnie and Clyde love  
They say it's wrong, but that's the way you turn me on  
We got that hood love  
We got that good love  
Make me make bad  
Boy, you make me make bad decisions  
Bad boy, you make me make bad decisions

[Verse 2]  
No, they ain't gonna understand it  
Understand what I see in you  
They don't know when you touch my body  
That I see the truth  
Let 'em keep, let 'em keep on talking  
Cause I know that I got someone  
Anytime that I need some danger  
Gonna get that, ooh ooh

[Pre-Chorus]  
I've been doing stupid things  
Wilder than I've ever been  
You've become my favorite sin  
So let 'em keep, let 'em keep on talking  
That's right

[Chorus]  
We got that hood love  
We got that good love  
We got that hot love  
We got that "I don't give a what" love  
We got that one life  
Gimme that all night  
We got that Bonnie and Clyde love  
They say it's wrong, but that's the way you turn me on  
We got that hood love  
We got that good love  
Make me make bad  
Boy, you make me make bad decisions  
Bad boy, you make me make bad decisions

[Bridge]  
Don't you know I ain't fuckin' with them good boys?  
Know you love me like ain't nobody could, boy  
If you want it, boy, you got it  
Ain’t you ever seen a princess be a bad bitch?

[Chorus]  
We got that hood love  
We got that good love  
We got that hot love  
We got that "I don't give a what" love  
We got that one life  
Gimme that all night  
We got that Bonnie and Clyde love  
They say it's wrong, but that's the way you turn me on  
We got that hood love  
We got that good love  
Make me make bad  
Boy, you make me make bad decisions  
Bad, boy, you make me make bad decisions  
Bad boy, you make me make bad decisions
