### Lowkey歌词：

Wonder what I'll do when the cops come through and the whiskey's run out  
'Cause I've been lookin' at you since half past two wanna take this downtown  
This liquid courage got me way too honest  
Put your phone on vibrate let's catch a vibe babe while the sun's down  
Hush now I know we're a little too f**ked up to stay still love  
Be as quiet as you can 'cause if anyone sees they'll just blow s**t up  
I don't gotta know if you're taken I'll just let ya know bedroom's vacant  
No one's gotta know just us and the moon 'til the sun starts wakin'  
Up's the only direction I see  
As long as we keep this  
Low low low low low low low low-key  
Ah-ah ah-ah  
You ain't even gotta lo- lo- lo- lo- lo- lo- lo- love me  
Ah-ah ah-ah  
Us in a king-size keep it a secret  
Say I'm your queen I don't wanna leave this  
Low low low low low low low low-key  
Wizard with words tellin' me my energy's so bewitchin'  
So I'll go first there's an open bar let's close this distance  
Oh oh oh oh oh my don't make me have to spell it all night  
I don't really give a f**k 'bout all the he said she said bulls**t  
So pick your poison love let's go somewhere a little more exclusive  
Take a shot take a chance take my hand boy  
Tension so intense like an asteroid  
Be discreet gotta dodge all the tabloids  
Let's not think too much there ain't no problems  
So long as we keep this  
Low low low low low low low low-key  
Ah-ah ah-ah  
You ain't even gotta lo- lo- lo- lo- lo- lo- lo- love me  
Ah-ah ah-ah  
Us in a king-size keep it a secret  
Say I'm your queen I don't wanna leave this  
Low low low low low low low low-key  
Low-key low-key
