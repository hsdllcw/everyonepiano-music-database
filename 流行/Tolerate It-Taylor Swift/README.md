**Tolerate It** 由美国女歌手Taylor Swift 演唱，收录于《Evermore》专辑中。

这首歌蕴含的情感很浓。女主在男主身边坐着，看着男主冷漠地干着自己的事情，随后逐渐陷入深思，想着自己做着一切幼稚的事情，只为讨得男主的一个笑容，一句认可。自己把他当做自己的一切，甚至是生活的信仰，换来的却是冷漠甚至是不耐烦的忍受！而Taylor站在女方的角度把这种痛苦表达了出来。太绝了！

### Tolerate It歌词：

I sit and watch you reading with your head low  
I wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed  
I sit and watch you  
I notice everything you do or don't do  
You're so much older and wiser and I  
I wait by the door like I'm just a kid  
Use my best colors for your portrait  
Lay the table with the fancy s**t  
And watch you tolerate it  
If it's all in my head tell me now  
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow  
I know my love should be celebrated  
But you tolerate it  
I greet you with a battle hero's welcome  
I take your indiscretions all in good fun  
I sit and listen  
I polish plates until they gleam and glisten  
You're so much older and wiser and I  
I wait by the door like I'm just a kid  
Use my best colors for your portrait  
Lay the table with the fancy s**t  
And watch you tolerate it  
If it's all in my head tell me now  
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow  
I know my love should be celebrated  
But you tolerate it  
While you were out building other worlds where was I  
Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire  
I made you my temple my mural my sky  
Now I'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life  
Drawing hearts in the byline  
Always taking up too much space or time  
You assume I'm fine but what would you do if I  
Break free and leave us in ruins  
Took this dagger in me and removed it  
Gain the weight of you then lose it  
Believe me I could do it  
If it's all in my head tell me now  
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow  
I know my love should be celebrated  
But you tolerate it  
I sit and watch you
