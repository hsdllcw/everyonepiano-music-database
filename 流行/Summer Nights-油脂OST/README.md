### Summer Nights歌词：

Summer loving had me a blast, oh yeah  
Summer loving happened so fast,  
I met a girl crazy for me,  
Met a boy cute as can be,

Summer days drifting away,  
To, uh oh, those summer nights

Well-a well-a well-a huh  
Tell me more, tell me more  
Did you get very far?  
Tell me more, tell me more  
Like does he have a car?

She swam by me, she got a cramp  
He ran by me, got my suit damp  
I saved her life, she nearly drowned  
He showed off, splashing around

Summer sun, something's begun  
But, oh, oh, these summer nights

Well-a well-a well-a huh  
Tell me more, tell me more  
Was it love at first sight?  
Tell me more, tell me more  
Did she put up a fight?

Took her bowling in the Arcade  
We went strolling, drank lemonade  
We made out under the dock  
We stayed up 'till ten o'clock

Summer fling, don't mean a thing  
But, oh, oh, those summer nights

Tell him more, tell him more  
But you don't gotta brag  
Tell me more, tell me more  
'Cause he sounds like a drag

Shoo-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop  
shoo-bop-bop shoo-bop-bop shoo-bop-bop YEAH!

He got friendly, holding my hand  
She got friendly down in the sand  
He was sweet just turned eighteen  
Well, she was good you know what I mean

Summer heat, boy and girl meet  
But, oh, oh, the summer nights

Tell me more, tell me more  
How much dough did he spend?  
Tell me more, tell me more  
Could she get me a friend?

It turned colder, that's where it ends  
So I told her we'd still be friends  
Then we made our true love vow  
Wonder what she's doing now

Summer dreams, ripped at the seams  
Bu-ut oh, those summer nights!  
Tell me more, tell me more!
