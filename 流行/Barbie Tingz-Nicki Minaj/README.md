### Barbie Tingz歌词：

Dem-dem-dem-dem dem-dem  
Dem-dem-dem-dem  
Dem-dem-dem-dem dem-dem  
Dem-dem-dem-dem  
Uh, I'm in my prime, Optimus  
Sagittarius, so you know I'm an optimist  
Man, keep it all real, I'm a prophetess (okay)  
So at least you took an L off your bucket list (bucket list)  
It's time to make hits and it's time to diss  
How you still dissin', still can't find some hits? (Okay)  
Was it worth it, dummy? I ain't mind a bit  
Still on that show gettin' no chips, time to dip  
I, I, I, I-I, I-I, I (okay)  
I'm still fly, just bagged a white guy (okay)  
Ritchie like Guy and I still eat Thai  
Want the Nicki cheat code? Come on, bitch, nice try  
Let's be real, all you bitches wanna look like me  
Wanna be in demand, get booked like me  
Wanna run up in the lab and cook like me  
But ain't nan you hoes pussy good like me  
Pussy so good his ex wanna still fight me  
Face so pretty bitches wish they could slice me  
She just mad 'cause he never bought her ice like me  
I cut all my niggas off, but they would still wife me (still wife me)  
Rap bitches tell they team, "Make 'em like Barbie"  
Had to come off IG so they can't stalk me  
All they do is copy looks, steal music too  
Want to see what bitches do when they lose the blue-print  
I mean the pinkprint, ho, let it sink in  
I spoke to Jay the other day, he's still the kingpin  
He's still the only nigga that I woulda signed to  
If I ain't sign to Wayne's perfectly designed crew  
'Cause we the big 3, don't need a big speech  
We made the biggest impact, check the spreadsheet  
That's Lil Weezy, the Barbie and Drizzy Drake  
Niggas gettin' more cheese, kissy face  
I'm a bad bitch, fuck the bitch (uh)  
Bitch get slick, I'ma cut the bitch  
I'm a bad bitch, suck some dick (okay)  
If that bitch get slick, I'll cut the bitch  
I'll cut up the bitch, I'll gut the bitch (okay)  
Had to fuck up the bitch, man, fuck the bitch  
Won't shoot her but I will gun-butt the bitch  
When we say "Fuck the bitch" dick-up the bitch  
She was stuck-up so my niggas stuck up the bitch  
Still draggin' her so don't pick up the bitch  
Get the combination to the safe, drug the bitch  
Know the whole operation been bugged the bitch  
I, I, I, I-I, I-I, I (okay)  
I'm still fly, just bagged a white guy (okay)  
Ritchie like Guy and I still eat Thai  
Want the Nicki cheat code? Come on, bitch, nice try  
Let's be real, all you bitches wanna look like me  
Wanna be in demand, get booked like me  
Wanna run up in the lab and cook like me  
But ain't nan you hoes pussy good like me  
Pussy so good his ex wanna still fight me  
Face so pretty bitches wish they could slice me  
She just mad 'cause he never bought her ice like me  
I cut all my niggas off, but they would still wife me (still wife me)  
They would still wife me  
They would still wife me  
Yup, him too, he would still wife me  
Ahh, ha  
When it come to stealin' flows, these birds is fluent  
But they stutter when get asked 'bout the queen's influence  
When it's clear they bite me, I'm flattered they like me  
I don't wanna check bitches, tell 'em wear their Nikes  
Barbie tings, that's Barbie tings  
Big Barbie tings, that's Barbie tings  
Big Barbie tings, that's Barbie tings  
Uh, Barbie dreamhouse, Barbie rings  
That's Barbie beach house, Barbie Benz  
Barbie white picket, Barbie fence  
All tea, all shade, bitch, all offense  
If you ever try to confiscate Barbie's ken  
I'ma put you in the box where my dollies been  
Chop it up and the next stop garbage bin  
'Cause you hoes too old to be gossipin'  
I'm just tryna find out when the new Porsche come in
