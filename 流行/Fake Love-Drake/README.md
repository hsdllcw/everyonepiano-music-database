### Fake Love歌词：

Yeah, yeah  
I've been down so long it look like up to me  
They look up to me  
I got fake people showin' fake love to me  
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face  
I've been down so long it look like up to me  
They look up to me  
I got fake people showin' fake love to me  
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face  
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'  
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'  
Look like you hidin' your problems  
Really you never was all in  
No you can't son me, you won't never get to run me  
Just when shit look out of reach, I reach back like one, three  
Like one, three, yeah  
That's when they smile in my face  
Whole time they wanna take my place  
Whole time they wanna take my place  
Whole time they wanna take my place  
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place  
I can tell that love is fake  
I don't trust a word you say  
How you wanna click up after your mistakes?  
Look you in the face and it's just not the same  
I've been down so long it look like up to me  
They look up to me  
I got fake people showin' fake love to me  
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face  
I've been down so long it look like up to me  
They look up to me  
I got fake people showin' fake love to me  
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face  
Yeah, straight up to my face, tryna play it safe  
Vibe switch like night and day, I can see it like right away  
I came up, you changed up, I caught that whole play  
Since then, things never been the same  
That's when they smile in my face  
Whole time they wanna take my place  
Whole time they wanna take my place  
Whole time they wanna take my place  
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place  
I can tell that love is fake  
(I can tell that love is fake)  
I don't trust a word you say  
(I don't trust a word you say)  
How you wanna click up after your mistakes?  
(How you wanna click up after your mistakes?)  
Look you in the face and it's just not the same  
I've been down so long it look like up to me  
They look up to me  
I got fake people showin' fake love to me  
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face  
I've been down so long it look like up to me  
They look up to me  
I got fake people showin' fake love to me  
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face  
Skrrt (skrrt, skrrt)
