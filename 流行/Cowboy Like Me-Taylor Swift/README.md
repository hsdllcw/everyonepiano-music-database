### Cowboy Like Me歌词：

And the tennis court was covered up  
With some tent-like thing  
And you asked me to dance  
But I said "dancing is a dangerous game"  
Oh I thought  
This is gonna be one of those things  
Now I know  
I'm never gonna love again  
I've got some tricks up my sleeve  
Takes one to know one  
You're a cowboy like me  
Never wanted love  
Just a fancy car  
Now I'm waiting by the phone  
Like I'm sitting in an airport bar  
You had some tricks up your sleeve  
Takes one to know one  
You're a cowboy like me  
Perched in the dark  
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear  
Like it could be love  
I could be the way forward  
Only if they pay for it  
You're a bandit like me  
Eyes full of stars  
Hustling for the good life  
Never thought I'd meet you here  
It could be love  
We could be the way forward  
And I know I'll pay for it  
You're a cowboy like me  
Perched in the dark  
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear  
Like it could be love  
I could be the way forward  
Only if they pay for it  
You're a bandit like me  
Eyes full of stars  
Hustling for the good life  
Never thought I'd meet you here  
It could be love  
We could be the way forward  
And I know I'll pay for it  
And the skeletons in both our closets  
Plotted hard to f**k this up  
And the old men that I've swindled  
Really did believe I was the one  
And the ladies lunching have their stories about  
When you passed through town  
But that was all before I locked it down  
Now you hang from my lips  
Like the Gardens of Babylon  
With your boots beneath my bed  
Forever is the sweetest con  
I've had some tricks up my sleeve  
Takes one to know one  
You're a cowboy like me  
And I'm never gonna love again  
I'm never gonna love again  
I'm never gonna love again
