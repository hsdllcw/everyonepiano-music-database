### If I Get My Way歌词：

Jade：  
Mmm  
This night no I don't wanna talk about her  
Tonight I really wanna fix your hurt  
'Cause I can see it in your face  
Your heart is breaking heart is breaking  
And no this night no I don't wanna hear her name  
Tonight no I don't wanna play her games  
'Cause I I really wanna be the one to take you  
One to take you home  
Perrie：  
Fed up of being the shoulder you cry on  
I want to be the shoulder you lie on  
Everyday every night  
I'll be fine I'll be fine  
If you're mine  
Fed up of being the one that you lean on  
I want to be the one that you dream of  
Everyday every night  
I'll be fine I'll be fine I'll be fine  
Both：  
If I get my way  
I'mma take care of you  
I can take her place  
Let me get my way ooh  
If you let me try  
Just one night I can prove  
I can take her place  
Let me get my way ooh  
Hey hey  
Jesy：  
This time no I'mma make you see me too  
This night I'm never letting go of you  
Tonight I'mma put a end to all the waiting  
All the waiting  
Leigh-Anne：  
Fed up of being the shoulder you cry on  
I want to be the shoulder you lie on  
Everyday every night  
I'll be fine I'll be fine  
If you're mine  
Fed up of being the one that you lean on  
I want to be the one that you dream of  
Everyday every night  
I'll be fine I'll be fine I'll be fine  
Both：  
If I get my way  
I'mma take care of you  
I can take her place  
Let me get my way ooh  
If you let me try  
Just one night I can prove  
I can take her place  
Let me get my way ooh  
Jade：  
Don't you know I try  
To forget about you at night  
Being more than just friends oh I need ya  
Cause I've been on your side  
Long before this new girl came by  
She does nothing but tell you lies  
I know  
Leigh-Anne/Perrie：  
If I get my way  
I'mma take care of you  
I can take her place  
Let me get my way ooh  
If you let me try  
Just one night I can prove  
I can take her place  
Let me get my way  
Oooh  
Both：  
If I get my way  
I'mma take care of you  
I can take her place  
Let me get my way ooh  
If you let me try me try  
Just one night I can prove  
I can take her place  
Let me get my way ooh  
If I get my way  
I'mma take care of you  
I'mma take care of you  
I can take her place  
Let me get my way ooh  
If you let me try  
Just one night I can prove  
I can take her place  
Let me get my way ooh
