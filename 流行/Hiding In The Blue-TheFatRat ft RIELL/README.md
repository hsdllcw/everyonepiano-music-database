德国音乐人TheFatRat和加拿大女歌手Riell合作的《 **Hiding In The Blue** 》于2021年7月发行。

TheFatRat制作的悦耳动听的音乐旋律，依然还是他那独特的音乐格调，让人一听便沉侵在TheFatRat的音乐世界中。歌曲再配上Riell灵动婉转的嗓音，独有一番韵味。歌词唱的内容依旧是寓意深厚，歌词内容和封面图片交相辉映，讲述了因为战争导致一名战士产生了忧郁感，使他选择独自躲进了自己内心世界的一块与世隔绝的岛屿，他从此便高高在上地俯瞰着下面的战争，永远的远离了潜在的危险。歌词中重复的最多的歌词便是“In
The Blue”（在忧郁的世界）这很容易让人想起成长路上遇到的各种挫折，然而逃避是解决不了任何问题的，只有迎难而上披荆斩棘才能解决困难。

### Hiding In The Blue歌词：

I'm alone here on my island  
Floating in the sky I'm  
High above the world I used to know  
And I'm far from any danger  
Safe from any failure  
Guarded I found shelter in the storm  
I'm hiding in the blue  
Safe between the clouds  
In the blue  
Where I can't be found  
Was a soldier in the legions  
Fought against the demons  
Fought against the monsters made of gold  
But they stormed across Arcadia  
Following their nature  
Washed away the place I once called home  
I'm hiding in the blue  
Safe between the clouds  
In the blue  
Where I can't be found  
I'm hiding in the blue  
I'm hiding in the blue  
As time goes racing by I'm  
Wishing I could be fine  
But I'm still so stuck on what used to be  
Made a prison out of my mind  
Watch life as it goes by  
Battle scarred my own worst enemy  
I'm hiding in the blue  
Safe between the clouds  
In the blue  
Where I can't be found  
I'm hiding in the blue  
I'm hiding in the blue  
Hiding in the blue  
The world's passing by and  
I lost sense of time I've  
Gone numb I miss the days when  
We were making legends  
The days come and go I'll  
Wait through sun and snow  
For you to come and take me from  
This place and bring me home  
In the blue  
Safe between the clouds  
In the blue  
Where I can't be found  
I'm hiding in the blue  
Hiding in the blue  
In the blue
