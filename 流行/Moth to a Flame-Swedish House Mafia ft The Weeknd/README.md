### Moth to a Flame歌词：

Like a moth to a flame  
I'll pull you in I'll pull you back to  
What you need initially  
It's just one call away ayy ayy  
And you'll leave him you're loyal to me  
But this time I'll let you be  
'Cause he seems like he's good for you  
And he makes you feel like you should  
And all your friends say "He's the one"  
His love for you is true  
But does he know you call me when he sleeps  
Or does he know the pictures that you keep  
Or does he know the reasons that you cry  
Or tell me does he know where your heart lies  
Where it truly lies  
Yeah you should be with him I let you go from time  
You should stay with him  
'Cause he seems like he's good for you  
And he makes you feel like you should  
And all your friends say "He's the one"  
His love for you is true  
Ooh  
But does he know you call me when he sleeps  
Or does he know the pictures that you keep  
Or does he know the reasons that you cry  
Or tell me does he know where your heart lies  
Where it truly lies  
Right here with me baby  
Where it truly lies  
My baby  
Where it truly lies  
Give me all of it  
Where it truly lies  
Where it truly lies  
Where it truly lies  
Where it truly lies
