### Bridges歌词：

Gave you a minute  
When you needed an hour  
Just to push it aside  
Instead of leaving it behind you

If any word that I said  
Could have made you forget  
I'd have given you them all  
But it was all in your head

And we're burning all the bridges now  
Watching them go up in flames  
No way to build them up again

Now we're burning all the bridges now  
'Cause it was sink or swim and I went down, down, down

And we're burning all the bridges  
Burning all the bridges now  
And we're burning all the bridges  
Burning all the bridges now

If I didn't kill it  
Would you still say you needed me?  
Guess I walked right into it  
Guess I made it too easy

If any word that you said could have made me forget  
Would I get up off the floor  
Cause this is all in my head

And we're burning all the bridges now  
Watching them go up in flames  
No way to build them up again

And we're burning all the bridges  
Burning all the bridges now  
And we're burning all the bridges  
Burning all the bridges now

Can we forget about it?  
Can we forget?  
Can we forget about it?  
Can we forget?

Burning all the bridges  
Burning all the bridges now  
And we're burning all the bridges  
Burning all the bridges now
