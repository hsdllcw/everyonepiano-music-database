### You Broke Me First歌词：

You broke me first ooh oh  
Maybe you don't like talking too much about yourself  
But you should have told me  
That you were thinking 'bout someone else  
You're drunk at a party  
Or maybe it's just that your car broke down  
Your phone's been off for a couple of months  
So you're calling me now  
I know you you're like this  
When s**t don't go your way you needed me to fix it  
And like me I did  
But I ran out of every reason  
Now suddenly you're asking for it back  
Could you tell me where'd you get the nerve  
Yeah you could say you miss all that we had  
But I don't really care how bad it hurts  
When you broke me first  
You broke me first  
Took a while was in denial when I first heard  
That you moved on quicker than I could've ever  
You know that hurt  
Swear for a while I would stare at my phone  
Just to see your name  
But now that it's there I don't really know what to say  
I know you you're like this  
When s**t don't go your way you needed me to fix it  
And like me I did  
But I ran out of every reason  
Now suddenly you're asking for it back  
Could you tell me where'd you get the nerve  
Yeah you could say you miss all that we had  
But I don't really care how bad it hurts  
When you broke me first  
You broke me first  
What did you think would happen  
What did you think would happen  
I'll never let you have it  
What did you think would happen  
Now suddenly you're asking for it back  
Could you tell me where'd you get the nerve  
Yeah you could say you miss all that we had  
But I don't really care how bad it hurts  
When you broke me first  
You broke me first  
You broke me first  
You broke me first ooh oh
