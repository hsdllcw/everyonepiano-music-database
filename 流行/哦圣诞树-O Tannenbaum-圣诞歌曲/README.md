### Oh Christmas Tree-O Tannenbaum英文歌词：

O Christmas Tree, O Christmas Tree,

Your branches green delight us.

O Christmas Tree, O Christmas Tree,

Your branches green delight us.

They're green when summer days are bright;

They're green when winter snow is white.

O, Christmas Tree, O Christmas Tree,

Your branches green delight us!

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree!

How are thy leaves so verdant!

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,

How are thy leaves so verdant!

Not only in the summertime,

But even in winter is thy prime.

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,

How are thy leaves so verdant!

O Christmas Tree, O Christmas Tree,

You give us so much pleasure!

O Christmas Tree, O Christmas Tree,

You give us so much pleasure!

How oft at Christmas tide the sight,

O green fir tree, gives us delight!

O Christmas Tree, O Christmas Tree,

You give us so much pleasure!

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,

Much pleasure dost thou bring me!

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,

Much pleasure dost thou bring me!

For every year the Christmas tree,

Brings to us all both joy and glee.

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,

Much pleasure dost thou bring me!

O Christmas Tree, O Christmas Tree,

Your branches green delight us.

O Christmas Tree, O Christmas Tree,

Your branches green delight us.

They're green when summer days are bright;

They're green when winter snow is white.

O Christmas Tree, O Christmas Tree,

Your branches green delight us!

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,

Thy candles shine out brightly!

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,

Thy candles shine out brightly!

Each bough doth hold its tiny light,

That makes each toy to sparkle bright.

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,

Thy candles shine out brightly!

Oh Christmas tree, Oh Christmas tree

Forever true your color

Oh Christmas tree, Oh Christmas tree

Forever true your color

Your boughs so green in summertime

Stay bravely green in wintertime

Oh Christmas tree, Oh Christmas tree

Forever true your color

Oh Christmas tree, Oh Christmas tree

You fill my heart with music

Oh Christmas tree, Oh Christmas tree

You fill my heart with music

Reminding me on Christmas day

To think of you and then be gay

Oh Christmas tree, Oh Christmas tree

You fill my heart with music

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree!

How are thy leaves so verdant!

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,

How are thy leaves so verdant!

Not only in the summertime,

But even in winter is thy prime.

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,

How are thy leaves so verdant!

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,

Much pleasure dost thou bring me!

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,

Much pleasure dost thou bring me!

For every year the Christmas tree,

Brings to us all both joy and glee.

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,

Much pleasure dost thou bring me!

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,

Thy candles shine out brightly!

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,

Thy candles shine out brightly!

Each bough doth hold its tiny light,

That makes each toy to sparkle bright.

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,

Thy candles shine out brightly!
