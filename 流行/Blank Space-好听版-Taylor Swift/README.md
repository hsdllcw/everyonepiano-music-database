### Blank Space歌词：

Nice to meet you where you been  
I could show you incredible things  
Magic madness heaven sin  
Saw you there and I thought  
Oh my God look at that face  
You look like my next mistake  
Love's a game wanna play  
New money suit and tie  
I can read you like a magazine  
Ain't it funny rumors fly  
And I know you heard about me  
So hey let's be friends  
I'm dying to see how this one ends  
Grab your passport and my hand  
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend  
So it's gonna be forever  
Or it's gonna go down in flames  
You can tell me when it's over  
If the high was worth the pain  
Got a long list of ex-lovers  
They'll tell you I'm insane  
'Cause you know I love the players  
And you love the game  
'Cause we're young and we're reckless  
We'll take this way too far  
It'll leave you breathless  
Or with a nasty scar  
Got a long list of ex-lovers  
They'll tell you I'm insane  
But I've got a blank space baby  
And I'll write your name  
Cherry lips crystal skies  
I could show you incredible things  
Stolen kisses pretty lies  
You're the King baby I'm your Queen  
Find out what you want  
Be that girl for a month  
Wait the worst is yet to come oh no  
Screaming crying perfect storms  
I can make all the tables turn  
Rose garden filled with thorns  
Keep you second guessing like  
Oh my God who is she  
I get drunk on jealousy  
But you'll come back each time you leave  
'Cause darling  
I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream  
So it's gonna be forever  
Or it's gonna go down in flames  
You can tell me when it's over  
If the high was worth the pain  
Got a long list of ex-lovers  
They'll tell you I'm insane  
'Cause you know I love the players  
And you love the game  
'Cause we're young and we're reckless  
We'll take this way too far  
It'll leave you breathless  
Or with a nasty scar  
Got a long list of ex-lovers  
They'll tell you I'm insane  
But I've got a blank space baby  
And I'll write your name  
Boys only want love if it's torture  
Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn ya  
Boys only want love if it's torture  
Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn ya  
So it's gonna be forever  
Or it's gonna go down in flames  
You can tell me when it's over  
If the high was worth the pain  
Got a long list of ex-lovers  
They'll tell you I'm insane  
'Cause you know I love the players  
And you love the game  
'Cause we're young and we're reckless  
We'll take this way too far  
It'll leave you breathless  
Or with a nasty scar  
Got a long list of ex-lovers  
They'll tell you I'm insane  
But I've got a blank space baby  
And I'll write your name
