### Ritual歌词：

Too high too deep  
It's you it's me  
Too wide too steep oh yeah  
One thing to me  
Three words I speak  
When you're with me babe  
Oh come on come on  
However I act you know how much I care  
Come on come on  
You know what I want now meet me if you dare  
Now run now run now run now run now run  
To anything to be there be there  
And I'll always be singing it like a prayer  
Oh when you touch me there  
Oh you'll always be my ritual  
Always love you all through the night and  
Be there when the sun is rising  
Oh you'll always be my ritual  
Oh you'll always be my ritual  
Oh you'll always be my ritual  
Your worry should be  
Beneath the sheets  
All love unique and even when  
You're in my bed you're in my head  
You're all I need  
Oh come on come on  
However I act you know how much I care  
Come on come on  
You know what I want now meet me if you dare  
Now run now run now run now run now run  
To anything to be there be there  
And I'll always be singing it like a prayer  
Oh when you touch me there  
Oh you'll always be my ritual  
Always love you all through the night and  
Be there when the sun is rising  
Oh you'll always be my ritual  
Oh you'll always be my ritual  
Oh you'll always be my ritual  
So come on come on come on come on come on babe  
So come on come on come on come on come on babe  
Oh now run now run now run now run now run babe  
Oh anywhere be there babe  
And I'll always be singing it like a prayer  
Oh you touch me there  
Oh you'll always be my ritual  
Always love you all through the night and  
Be there when the sun is rising  
Oh you'll always be my ritual  
Always singing it like a prayer  
Oh you touch me there  
Oh you'll always be my ritual  
Always love you all through the night and  
Be there when the sun is rising  
Oh you'll always be my ritual  
You'll always be my ritual
