### Extra Luv歌词：

Too much poppin' in my life baby I just really need some time baby  
Come and check up on my line baby out of time baby ah noo  
Fell in love with the lifestyle black shades night clout  
She want to f**k but she don't love me  
Lifestyle lifestyle  
Strapped up but I'm iced down all white crib with the black towel  
She don't want to love me  
Lifestyle lifestyle  
Oo oo oo oo ooh  
You never really loved me  
You ain't never loved me  
Ahhh ahhh never really loved me  
You ain't never loved me  
Oo oo oo oo ooh  
Never really loved me  
It's my lifestyle it's my lifestyle  
Lil mama fell in love with the lifestyle  
Four bad bitches on a white couch  
Last night tried to pipe down  
Told her hol' up let me put the pipe down  
Touchdown I ain't even ate yet  
Serve it on a platter in a red dress  
Chinchilla turn that bitch to Mona Lisa  
All she want to do is f**k hit the bitch  
Sand from her toes out the Lambo  
Hit 30k golds for your sandals  
30 round clip for the round  
Drivin' in the whip up the wrong way  
Extra luv extra luv extra luv  
Extra luv  
Lifestyle lifestyle  
Oo oo oo oo ooh  
You never really loved me  
Ahhh ahhh never really loved me  
Oo oo oo oo ooh  
Never really loved me  
You ain't never loved me  
It's my lifestyle it's my lifestyle  
Hol' up hol' up  
It's back-back when I come through back up  
Come through the back when I come through back up  
Got the bag that's a fact when I come through  
It go brat when I come through  
Mansion in the hills and my neighbors is so nosy  
Only Maybach in Bompton so I'm sliding with the 40  
Gotta keep it on me cause I iced out the Rollie  
My diamonds on disco and they dancin' hokie pokie  
Put my left wrist in you see that bitch blinged out  
Put my right wrist in you see that bitch blinged out  
Put 'em both together that's 200 on me ouch  
That's what my lifestyle about  
No you ain't never loved me now you want to f**k me  
Gotta deal with all this fake shit  
Damn I'm so lucky come here and f**k me girl
