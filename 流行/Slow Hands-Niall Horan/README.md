### Slow Hands歌词：

We should take this back to my place  
That's what she said right to my face  
'Cause I want you bad, yeah, I want you, baby  
I've been thinking 'bout it all day  
And I hope you feel the same way, yeah  
'Cause I want you bad, yeah, I want you, baby  
Slow, slow hands  
Like sweat dripping down our dirty laundry  
No, no chance  
That I'm leaving here without you on me  
I, I know, yeah, I already know that there ain't no stopping  
Your plans and those slow hands  
Slow hands  
I just wanna take my time  
We could do this, baby, all night, yeah  
'Cause I want you bad  
Yeah, I want you, baby  
Slow, slow hands  
Like sweat dripping down our dirty laundry  
No, no chance  
That I'm leaving here without you on me  
I, I know, yeah, I already know that there ain't no stopping  
Your plans and those slow hands  
Fingertips putting on a show  
Got me now and I can't say "No"  
Wanna be with you all alone  
Take me home, take me home  
Fingertips putting on a show  
Can't you tell that I want you, baby, yeah  
Slow hands  
Like sweat dripping down our dirty laundry  
No, no chance  
That I'm leaving here without you on me  
I, I know, yeah, I already know that there ain't no stopping  
Slow hands  
Like sweat dripping down our dirty laundry  
No, no chance  
That I'm leaving here without you on me  
I, I know, yeah, I already know that there ain't no stopping  
Your plans and those slow hands  
Slow hands  
Slow hands
