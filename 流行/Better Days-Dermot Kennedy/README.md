### Better Days歌词：

Better days are coming  
If no one told ya  
I hate to hear you crying  
Over the phone dear  
For seven years running  
You've been a soldier  
But better days are coming  
Better days are coming for you  
So when the night feels like forever  
I'll remember what you said to me  
I know you've been hurting  
Waiting on a train that just won't come  
The rain it ain't permanent  
And soon we'll be dancing in the sun  
We'll be dancing in the sun  
And we'll sing your song together  
We'll sing your song together  
We never miss the flowers  
Until the sun's down  
We never count the hours  
Until they're running out  
You're on the other side of the storm now  
You should be so proud  
And better days are coming  
Better days are coming for you  
So when the night feels like forever  
I'll remember what you said to me  
I know you've been hurting  
Waiting on a train that just won't come  
The rain it ain't permanent  
And soon we'll be dancing in the sun  
We'll be dancing in the sun  
And we'll sing your song together  
We'll sing your song together  
We'll sing your song together  
We'll sing your song together  
Your story's gonna change  
Just wait for better days  
You've seen too much of pain  
Now you don't even know  
That your story's gonna change  
Just wait for better days  
I promise you I won't let go  
I know you've been hurting  
Waiting on a train that just won't come  
The rain it ain't permanent  
And soon we'll be dancing in the sun  
We'll be dancing in the sun  
And we'll sing your song together  
We'll sing your song together  
We'll sing your song together  
We'll sing your song together
