### Don't Tattle On Me歌词：

[Intro]  
No more Mama  
No more Mama  
[Verse 1]  
I can’t sleep, leap out of bed  
Creep down the hall, sneak down the steps  
Into the creepy, creaky basement  
And discreetly peek at my gifts  
Open up, what could it be?  
That motor-mouth, those rosy cheeks!  
A baby talking Tattletail  
Who babble’s without fail  
[Chorus]  
Don’t tattle on me  
Don’t tattle on me  
‘Cause Mama’s sleeping  
And Mama’s scary  
No don't you speak!  
Or I might scream!  
‘Cause if she finds you  
Who knows what she’ll do  
[Verse 2]  
Hide and seek under the tree  
Red glowing eyes are all I see  
Maternal stalker by the stockings  
Matricidal children plotting  
Charge you, brush you, feed you treats  
Hey, who’s the toy here, you or me?  
Infernal presence in the presents  
Unsettled machine  
[Chorus]  
Don’t tattle on me  
Don’t tattle on me  
‘Cause Mama’s listening  
And Mama’s scary  
No don't you speak!  
Or I might scream!  
‘Cause if she finds you  
Who knows what she’ll do  
[Background]  
No More Mama  
No More Mama  
No More Mama  
No More Mama  
No More Mama  
No More Mama  
No More Mama  
No More  
[Bridge]  
Wound up like a VHS  
Shook up and I’m in distress  
Locked up in a cardboard box  
Broke up like a shattered pot  
Wake up from a bad, bad dream  
Strung up like a Christmas tree  
Messed up, so she got recalled  
Shut up  
[Chorus]  
And don’t tattle on me!  
Don’t tattle on me!  
‘Cause Mama’s watching  
And Mama’s scary  
Don't make a peep  
Or I might scream!  
‘Cause if she finds you  
You know what she'll do  
So don't tattle on me!  
[Outro]  
Ha-ha
