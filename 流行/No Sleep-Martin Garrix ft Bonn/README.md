**No Sleep双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_No Sleep_ 是Martin Garrix与Bonn一同合作的单曲。此曲为progressive
house风格，将今夜无法入睡的激动的心情和感慨全部写进了这首电音里，而bonn的声音像是专门为这首电音量身定做的。Martin
Garrix的电音可以让听众立马产生抖腿摇头的冲动。电音的优势在于能模仿各种乐器，把键盘乐、打碟机和吉他运用得炉火纯青的Martin，就像操纵着一支超级豪华乐队。

### No Sleep歌词：

Summer nights all align  
As we drown in the moonlight  
We collide in plain sight  
Yeah I know we'll be alright  
And we come alive  
We run the night with strangers  
'Cause in the end we're all familiar faces  
We're young and wild enjoy the ride we made it  
We made it  
I don't need no sleep  
'Cause I'm already dreaming already dreaming  
Say you'll never leave because I love the feeling  
I love the feeling  
Found myself awake at night  
See you through my lucid eyes  
Oh I don't need no sleep  
'Cause I'm already dreaming already dreaming  
I don't need no sleep  
'Cause I'm already dreaming  
Already dreaming  
Wide awake no time to waste  
Make a mark on my timeline  
We're safe and sound we come around  
We are dancing the sun down  
And we come alive  
We run the night with strangers  
'Cause in the end and we're all familiar faces  
We're young and wild enjoy the ride we made it  
We made it  
I don't need no sleep  
'Cause I'm already dreaming already dreaming  
Say you'll never leave because I love the feeling  
I love the feeling  
Found myself awake at night  
See you through my lucid eyes  
Oh I don't need no sleep  
'Cause I'm already dreaming already dreaming  
Oh I don't need no sleep  
'Cause I'm already dreaming  
Already dreaming  
Oh I don't need no sleep  
'Cause I'm already dreaming  
Already dreaming
