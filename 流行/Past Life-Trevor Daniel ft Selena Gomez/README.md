**Past Life** 是Selena Gomez联手Trevor Daniel的全新混音合作单曲。原曲作为Trevor
Daniel第一张录音室专辑《Nicotine》的收录曲，而Selena充满辨识度的嗓音为这首歌带来了全新的感觉！

沙哑声线与慵懒风情的完美结合，引人弥想前世｜引人侧目今生，旋律幽而不伤｜。节奏润缓疏朗，背景空灵飘渺

歌曲讲述了挥别过去迎接新生。唱出浮生若梦的前生记忆；道出蓦然回首的旧梦一场；忆往昔坦然相待诉尽衷肠；看方今大梦先觉重新起航。无论是从前的《失爱》还是如今的这首《前生》，那个善良睿智的灵魂都无不在告诉我们：结束那些不短不长的故事，放下昨夜无疾而终的幻想，生命才能风清月明，豁然开朗。

### Past Life歌词：

Trevor Daniel/Selena Gomez：  
I'm trying to be honest with my happiness  
Don't know why I'm bad at this uh  
And I don't wanna sit in all my sadness  
I know it's a habit of mine  
Selena Gomez/Trevor Daniel：  
Perfect perfect timing  
I start but I don't know how to end  
Don't re- don't remind me  
I ruined it before it began oh  
Selena Gomez/Trevor Daniel：  
Last night was the last night of my past life  
Got me here like you can never figure me out  
Last night was the last time was the last time  
I'll never let you figure me out  
Sitting here talking to myself  
Thinking how I used to use you  
Only thing I'm used to  
Last night was the last time was the last time woah  
Trevor Daniel/Selena Gomez：  
Gave me what I wanted when I needed it  
Honestly I mean it  
And if I could convince myself to feel it  
You know I would feel it I would  
Selena Gomez/Trevor Daniel：  
Perfect perfect timing  
I start but I don't know how to end  
Don't re- don't remind me  
I ruined it before it began oh

Last night was the last night of my past life  
Got me here like you can never figure me out  
Last night was the last time was the last time

Sitting here talking to myself  
Thinking how I used to use you

Will never go away
