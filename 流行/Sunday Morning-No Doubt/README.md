### Sunday Morning歌词：

Sappy pathetic little me  
That was the girl I used to be  
You had me on my knees  
I'd trade you places any day  
I'd never thought you could be that way  
But you looked like me on Sunday  
You came in with the breeze  
On Sunday Morning  
You sure have changed since yesterday  
Without any warning

I thought I knew you  
I thought I knew you  
I thought I knew you well... so well

You're trying my shoes on for a change  
They look so good but fit so strange  
Out of fashion so I can complain

You came in with the breeze  
On Sunday Morning  
You sure have changed since yesterday  
Without any warning

I thought I knew you  
I thought I knew you  
I thought I knew you well... so well

I know who I am, but who are you?  
You're not looking like you used to  
You're on the other side of the mirror  
So nothing's looking quite as clear

Thank you, for turning on the light  
Thank you, now you're the parasite  
I didn't think you had it in you  
And now, you're looking like I used to!

You came in with the breeze  
On Sunday Morning  
You sure have changed since yesterday  
Without any warning  
And you want me badly  
You cannot have me

I thought I knew you  
I've got a new view  
I thought I knew you well...oh well
