### I Found A Girl歌词：

This girl moved into my apartment one day  
One look at her my heart was stopping (heartbreak)  
I did whatever she was asking  
She said "maybe later catch you in the elevator"

A couple days we got to hanging real close  
Turns out she wasn't even taken (no no)  
I made a move she said "baby you're mistaken, I'm not into bacon"

She got that smile and that body is to die for  
One of a kind and that's why it makes me cry

'Cause I found a girl  
Who's in love with a girl  
She said that she tried  
But she's not into guys  
Oh, why, tell me why  
Did I fall for those eyes?  
She said I was nice  
But she's not into guys  
I found a girl

I should've known to walk away then  
I should've left it alone  
But when she called me on the phone we'd be hanging again  
Under the premise of friends  
But now she only talks to me about some other woman  
She says

She got that smile  
And that body is to die for  
One of a kind  
And that's why it makes me cry

'Cause I found a girl  
Who's in love with a girl  
She said, that she tried  
But she's not into guys  
Oh, why, tell me why  
Did I fall for those eyes?  
She said I was nice  
But she's not into guys  
I found a girl

Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh  
I found a girl  
Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh

I can't believe I met somebody like you  
And now I feel like a fool  
Anatomy is so cruel  
I can't believe it I just think like a man  
That you just wanted me bad  
But you had different plans

'Cause I found a girl  
Who's in love with a girl  
She said, that she tried  
But she's not into guys  
Oh, why, tell me why  
Did I fall for those eyes?  
She said I was nice  
But she's not into guys  
I found a girl

I found a girl  
Who's in love with a girl  
She said, that she tried  
But she's not into guys  
Oh, why, tell me why  
Did I fall for those eyes?  
She said I was nice  
But she's not into guys  
I found a girl
