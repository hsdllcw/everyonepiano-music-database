### Bitches歌词：

Appreciate it  
Touch me like you know what you do and what you don't  
But I'm feeling jaded  
Know your own love I don't f**k with no glove  
So why complicate it  
Let me be your guide when you eat my pussy out  
'Cause I've had one or two even a few  
Yeah more than you  
It's Charli baby  
All the girls stare at me drop lip  
Dripping in harmony like Fifth  
Lay 'em down feel 'em up  
And they slide away so easy  
So easy so easy like yeah  
B**ches I don't trust 'em  
But they give me what I want for the night  
B**ches I don't trust 'em  
But I tell 'em and they do what I like why  
B**ches I don't trust 'em  
But they give me what I want for the night  
B**ches I don't trust 'em  
But I tell 'em and they do what I like why  
They can't fake it  
No no no  
Drying off the seat when they getting up to leave  
So wet  
So they getting noticed  
I'm better if they blunt I don't really wanna hunt  
So why complicate it  
I call it respect when you givin' what you get  
So baby spread your legs I'll do the same already cumming  
All the girls stare at me drop lip  
Dripping in harmony like Fifth  
Lay 'em down feel 'em up  
And they slide away so easy  
So easy so easy like yeah  
B**ches I don't trust 'em  
But they give me what I want for the night  
For the night yeah yeah  
B**ches I don't trust 'em  
But I tell 'em and they do what I like why  
B**ches I don't trust 'em  
But they give me what I want for the night  
What I want what I want uh  
B**ches I don't trust 'em  
But I tell 'em and they do what I like why  
B is for balance I for intelligence  
T stands for tough trouble truly terrific  
C for courage H bitch holy  
Rise high pollenate Aphrodite right  
Turn my touches into neon light  
Chat it up now doggy come suck my eight titties  
I'm a free-headed goddess from the full moon land  
Venus hit the bong gon' sing it straight  
We tougher now we stand strong in the storm  
We don't back down we don't take sh*t no more  
We don't back down now we ahead of the game  
It's a new day of b**ches that no man can take yeah  
B**ches I don't trust 'em  
But they give me what I want for the night  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
B**ches I don't trust 'em  
But I tell 'em and they do what I like why  
B**ches I don't trust 'em  
But they give me what I want for the night  
Oh yeah  
B**ches I don't trust 'em  
But I tell 'em and they do what I like why  
B**ches I don't trust 'em  
But they give me what I want for the night  
Like that  
B**ches I don't trust 'em  
But I tell 'em and they do what I like why  
B**ches I don't trust 'em  
But they give me what I want for the night
