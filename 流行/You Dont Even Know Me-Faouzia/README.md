### You Don't Even Know Me歌词：

I walk into a crowded room  
Everybody staring  
What did I what did I do wrong  
What did I what did I do wrong  
Oh you see what you wanna see  
But you don't even know me  
What did I what did I do now  
What did I what did I do now  
He said she said over it  
You're acting like you're brilliant  
But you don't know  
Yeah you don't know  
You don't know a thing at all  
You don't know about the way I am when I am all alone  
You don't even know  
The way I care but way I'm grown  
You don't know about the way I love so deeply to my bones  
You don't even know me  
Woah  
Woah  
I walk it off and brush away  
Everything you say  
'Cause I don't care I don't care at all  
I don't care I don't care at all  
He said she said over it  
You're acting like you're brilliant  
But you don't know  
You don't know  
Yeah you don't know  
You don't know a thing at all  
You don't know about the way I am when I am all alone  
You don't even know  
The way I care but way I'm grown  
You don't know about the way I love so deeply to my bones  
You don't even know me  
Woah you don't even know me  
Woah you don't even know  
You don't know a thing at all  
You don't know about the way I am when I am all alone  
You don't even know  
The way I care but way I'm grown  
You don't know about the way I love so deeply to my bones  
You don't even know me  
You don't even know me oh
