### Magic歌词：

Call it magic  
Call it true  
Call it magic  
When I'm with you

And I just got broken  
Broken into two  
Still I call it magic  
When I'm next to you

And I don't, And I don't  
And I don't, And I don't  
Know, I don't, it's true  
I don't know, I don't know  
I don't know, I don't  
When anybody ask but you  
I don't know, I don't know  
I don't know, I don't  
Know, I don't, it's true  
I don't know, I don't know  
I don't know, I don't  
When anybody ask but you

Ooooh ooh ooh

Call it magic  
Cut me into two  
I'ma fold your magic  
I disappear from view  
And I can't get over  
Can't get over you  
Still I call it magic  
It's such a passion doom

And I don't, And I don't  
And I don't, And I don't  
Know, I don't, it's true  
I don't know, I don't know  
I don't know, I don't  
When anybody ask but you  
I don't know, I don't know  
I don't know, I don't  
Know, I don't, it's true  
I don't know, I don't know  
I don't know, I don't  
When anybody ask but you

Wanna fall  
I fall so far  
I wanna fall  
I fall so hard  
And I call it magic  
And I call it true  
I call it magic

Ooooh ooh ooh  
Ooooh ooh ooh  
Ooooh ooh ooh  
Ooooh ooh ooh

And if you were to ask me  
After all that we've been through  
Still believe in magic  
Oh yes I do  
Oh yes I do  
Yes I do  
Oh yes I do  
Of course I do
