### Behind Blue Eyes歌词：

I let you go I'm holdin' on  
I am here but you're long gone  
You think you own me you are wrong again  
Blindin' lights impoundin' veins  
Tryin' to escape my fate  
You're pourin' gas into the flame again  
No one knows what it's like to be the bad man  
To be the sad man  
Behind blue eyes  
No one knows what it's like to be hated  
To be faded  
To tellin' only lies  
But my dreams they are as empty  
As my conscience seems to be  
I have hours only lonely  
My love is vеngeance that's nevеr free  
No turnin' back no movin' on  
In the end I'm on my own  
But I don't wanna be alone again  
No one knows what it's like to be the bad man  
To be the sad man  
Behind blue eyes  
No one knows what it's like to be hated  
To be faded  
To tellin' only lies  
But my dreams they are as empty  
As my conscience seems to be  
I have hours only lonely  
My love is vengeance that's never free
