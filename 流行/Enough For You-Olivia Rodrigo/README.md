### Enough For You歌词：

I wore makeup when we dated  
'Cause I thought you'd like me more  
If I looked like the other prom queens  
I know that you loved before  
Tried so hard to be everything that you like  
Just for you to say you're not the compliment-type  
And I knew how you took your coffee  
And your favorite songs by heart  
I read all of your self-help books  
So you'd think that I was smart  
Stupid emotional obsessive little me  
I knew from the start this is exactly how you'd leave  
You found someone more exciting  
The next second you were gone  
And you left me there cryin' wonderin' what I did wrong  
And you always say I'm never satisfied  
But I don't think that's true  
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough for you  
All I ever wanted was to be enough for you  
And maybe I'm just not as interesting  
As the girls you had before  
But God you couldn't have cared less  
About someone who loved you more  
I'd say you broke my heart  
But you broke much more than that  
Now I don't want your sympathy  
I just want myself back  
Before you found someone more exciting  
The next second you were gone  
And you left me there cryin' wonderin' what I did wrong  
And you always say I'm never satisfied  
But I don't think that's true  
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough  
Don't you think I loved you too much to be used and discarded  
Don't you think I loved you too much to think I deserve nothing  
But don't tell me you're sorry boy  
Feel sorry for yourself  
'Cause someday I'll be everything to somebody else  
And they'll think that I'm so exciting  
And you'll be the one who's crying  
Yeah you always say I'm never satisfied  
But I don't think that's true  
You say I'm never satisfied  
But that's not me it's you  
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough  
But I don't think anything could ever be enough  
For you  
Enough for you oh  
No nothing's enough for you
