### Drugs & The Internet歌词：

Another life, another story  
She walked out, said I was boring  
About 3 AM, that's when I called my friends  
We hit the bar, sent myself flying  
Shit, I said I'm never trying  
'Til the bitter end, but every now and then  
I wonder what it feels like to be more than I am  
I traded all my friends for drugs and the internet  
Ah shit, am I a winner yet?  
Look quick, is he a winner yet?  
Mom's back home with a drink and a cigarette  
I traded all my friends for drugs and the internet  
Ah shit, am I a winner yet?  
Look quick, hasn't hit him yet  
Mom's back home with a drink and a cigarette  
Ooh, ooh  
Still hasn't hit him yet  
And I don't wanna base my actions  
On reactions or the things they say  
And I don't wanna hit delete  
On all the parts of me that they might hate  
So now I'm laying in my bed  
And I can't get out my head  
It's all because, all because  
I traded all my friends for drugs and the internet  
Ah shit, am I a winner yet?  
Look quick, is he a winner yet?  
Mom's back home with a drink and a cigarette  
I traded all my friend for drugs and the internet  
Ah shit, am I a winner yet?  
Look quick, hasn't hit him yet  
Mom's back home with a drink and a cigarette  
Ooh, ooh  
Still hasn't hit him yet  
Ooh, ooh  
Still hasn't hit him yet  
(Ooh)  
I sold my soul (Ooh, still hasn't hit him yet)  
And all I got (Ooh)  
Likes from strangers, love on the internet (Ooh)  
Drugs and the internet  
I wonder what it feels like  
To be more than I am, I am
