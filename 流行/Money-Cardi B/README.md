### Money歌词：

Look my b***hes all bad my n***as all real  
I ride on his d**k in some big tall heels  
Big fat checks big large bills  
Front I'll flip like ten cartwheels  
Cold a*s b***h I give broads chills  
Ten different looks and my looks all kill  
I kiss him in the mouth I feel all grills  
He eat in the car that's meals on wheels  
Woo  
I was born to flex  
Yes  
Diamonds on my neck  
I like boardin' jets I like mornin' sex  
Woo  
But nothing in this world that I like more than checks  
Money  
All I really wanna see is the  
Money  
I don't really need the D I need the  
Money  
All a bad b***h need is the  
Money flow
