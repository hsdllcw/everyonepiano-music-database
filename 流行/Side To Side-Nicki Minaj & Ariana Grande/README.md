### Side To Side歌词：

[Intro - Ariana Grande & Nicki Minaj:]  
I've been here all night, Ariana  
I've been here all day, Nicki Minaj  
And boy, got me walkin' side to side  
Let them hoes know

[Verse 1 - Ariana Grande:]  
I'm talkin' to ya  
See you standing over there with your body  
Feeling like I wanna rock with your body  
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin' ('bout nothin')  
I'm comin' at ya  
Cause I know you got a bad reputation  
Doesn't matter, cause you give me temptation  
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin' ('bout nothin')

[Pre-Chorus 1 - Ariana Grande:]  
These friends keep talkin' way too much  
Say I should give you up  
Can't hear them no, cause I...

[Chorus - Ariana Grande:]  
I've been here all night  
I've been here all day  
And boy, got me walkin' side to side  
I've been here all night  
I've been here all day  
And boy, got me walkin' side to side (side to side)

[Verse 2 - Ariana Grande:]  
Been tryna hide it  
Baby what's it gonna hurt if they don't know?  
Makin' everybody think that we solo  
Just as long as you know you got me (you got me)  
And boy I got ya  
Cause tonight I'm making deals with the devil  
And I know it's gonna get me in trouble  
Just as long as you know you got me

[Pre-Chorus 1 - Ariana Grande:]  
These friends keep talkin' way too much  
Say I should give you up  
Can't hear them no, cause I...

[Chorus - Ariana Grande:]  
I've been here all night  
I've been here all day  
And boy, got me walkin' side to side (side to side)  
I've been here all night  
(Been here all night, baby)  
I've been here all day  
(Been here all day, baby)  
And boy, got me walkin' side to side (side to side)

[Refrain - Nicki Minaj:]  
This the new style with the fresh type of flow  
Wrist icicle, ride dick bicycle  
Come true yo, get you this type of blow  
If you wanna Minaj I got a tricycle

[Verse 3 - Nicki Minaj:]  
All these bitches, flows is my mini-me  
Body smoking, so they call me young Nicki chimney  
Rappers in they feelings cause they feelin' me  
Uh, I-I give zero fucks and I got zero chill in me  
Kissing me, copped the blue box that say Tiffany  
Curry with the shot, just tell 'em to call me Stephanie  
Gun pop and I make my gum pop  
I'm the queen of rap, young Ariana run pop

[Pre-Chorus 2 - Ariana Grande:]  
These friends keep talkin' way too much  
Say I should give him up  
Can't hear them no, cause I...

[Chorus - Ariana Grande:]  
I've been here all night  
I've been here all day  
And boy, got me walkin' side to side (side to side)  
I've been here all night  
(Been here all night baby)  
I've been here all day  
(Been here all day baby)  
Boy, got me walkin' side to side (side to side)

[Refrain - Nicki Minaj:]  
This the new style with the fresh type of flow  
Wrist icicle, ride dick bicycle  
Come true yo, get you this type of blow  
If you wanna Minaj I got a tricycle
