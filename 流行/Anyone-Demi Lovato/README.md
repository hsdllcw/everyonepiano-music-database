**Anyone双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Anyone_ 是美国流行歌手Demi
Lovato演唱的歌曲。62届格莱美颁奖典礼现场Demi一袭白裙，拼尽全力演唱了这首倾注了她太多情感的歌，这些年她承受了多少痛苦只有她一个人知道。歌声撕心裂肺，那种意识到没有人能给予她真正关怀的绝望，那种需要身边人的安慰和倾诉的呼喊，势必触动每一颗同她一样破碎的心灵。希望每一个身处困境中的人都能心怀希望勇敢向前，也愿他们被世界温柔以待。

### Anyone歌词：

Uh uh  
I tried to talk to my piano  
I tried to talk to my guitar  
Talked to my imagination  
Confided into alcohol  
I tried and tried and tried some more  
Told secrets 'til my voice was sore  
Tired of empty conversation  
'Cause no one hears me anymore  
A hundred million stories  
And a hundred million songs  
I feel stupid when I sing  
Nobody's listening to me  
Nobody's listening  
I talked to shooting stars  
But they always get it wrong  
I feel stupid when I pray  
So why am I praying anyway  
If nobody's listening  
Anyone please send me anyone  
Lord is there anyone  
I need someone  
Anyone please send me anyone  
Lord is there anyone  
I need someone  
I used to crave the world's attention  
I think I cried too many times  
I just need some more affection  
Anything to get me by  
A hundred million stories  
And a hundred million songs  
I feel stupid when I sing  
Nobody's listening to me  
Nobody's listening  
I talked to shooting stars  
But they always get it wrong  
I feel stupid when I pray  
Why the f**k am I praying anyway  
If nobody's listening  
Anyone please send me anyone  
Lord is there anyone  
I need someone  
Anyone please send me anyone  
Oh Lord is there anyone  
I need someone  
Oh anyone I need anyone  
Oh anyone I need someone  
A hundred million stories  
And a hundred million songs  
I feel stupid when I sing  
Nobody's listening to me  
Nobody's listening
