《 **I'm Not the Only One** 》是英国歌手及词曲作家Sam Smith的歌曲，收录在其首张录音室专辑《In the Lonely
Hour》中。

这是一首以管弦乐与福音结构为基础的钢琴灵魂芭乐。歌词内容描写了一段不忠的感情关系，尽管主题是忧郁的，但Sam的假声中有着最奔放自由的灵魂。

歌曲的前奏营造出了一种神秘气氛，让人沉醉。而副歌小提琴的声音，很独特也很巧妙，瞬间抓住人的耳朵。Sam这首歌把他的迷离之音发挥的的淋漓尽致。这是一种对爱情的发泄，和歌曲的内容很贴近，适合一个人在午后静静聆听。

### I'm Not the Only One歌词：

You and me we made a vow  
For better or for worse  
I can't believe you let me down  
But the proof's in the way it hurts  
For months on end I've had my doubts  
Denying every tear  
I wish this would be over now  
But I know that I still need you here  
You say I'm crazy  
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done  
But when you call me baby  
I know I'm not the only one  
You've been so unavailable  
Now sadly I know why  
Your heart is unobtainable  
Even though Lord knows you kept mine  
You say I'm crazy  
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done  
But when you call me baby  
I know I'm not the only one  
I have loved you for many years  
Maybe I am just not enough  
You've made me realise my deepest fear  
By lying and tearing us up  
You say I'm crazy  
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done  
But when you call me baby  
I know I'm not the only one  
You say I'm crazy  
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done  
But when you call me baby  
I know I'm not the only one  
I know I'm not the only one  
I know I'm not the only one  
And I know and I know  
And I know and I know  
And I know and I know know  
I know I'm not the only one
