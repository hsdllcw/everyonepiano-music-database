### Bang!歌词：

I get up I get down and I'm jumpin' around  
And the rumpus and ruckus are comfortable now  
Been a hell of a ride but I'm thinking it's time to grow  
bang bang bang  
So I got an apartment across from the park  
Put quinoa in my fridge still I'm not feeling grown  
Been a hell of a ride but I'm thinking it's time to go  
Bang bang bang  
Here we go  
So put your best face on everybody  
Pretend you know this song everybody  
Come hang let's go out with a bang  
Bang bang bang  
I'm way too young to lie here forever  
I'm way too old to try so whatever  
Come hang let's go out with a bang  
Bang bang bang  
Feel like I'm gonna puke 'cause my taxes are due  
Do my password begin with a one or a two  
Been a hell of a ride but I'm thinking it's time to grow  
Bang bang bang  
Metronome  
Man I'm up to something  
Up to something  
Ooh-de-la-di-do thank you all for coming
