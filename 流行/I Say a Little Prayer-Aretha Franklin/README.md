I Say a Little Prayer歌词：

  
The moment I wake up  
Before I put on my makeup  
I say a little prayer for you  
While combing my hair, now,  
And wondering what dress to wear, now,  
I say a little prayer for you  
  
Forever, forever, you'll stay in my heart  
And I will love you  
Forever, forever, we never will part  
Oh, how I'll love you  
Together, together, that's how it must be  
To live without you  
Would only be heartbreak for me.  
  
I run for the bus, dear,  
While riding I think of us, dear,  
I say a little prayer for you.  
  
At work I just take time  
And all through my coffee break-time,  
I say a little prayer for you.  
  
Forever, forever, you'll stay in my heart  
Forever, forever, you'll stay in my heart  
Forever, forever, you'll stay in my heart  
And I will love you  
And I will love you  
And I will love you  
Forever, forever we never will part  
Forever, forever we never will part  
Forever, forever we never will part  
Oh, how I'll love you  
Oh, how I'll love you  
Oh, how I'll love you  
Together, together, that's how it must be  
Together, together, that's how it must be  
Together, together, that's how it must be  
To live without you  
To live without you  
To live without you  
Would only be heartbreak for me.  
Would only be heartbreak for me.  
Would only be heartbreak for me.  
  
  
  
My darling believe me,  
My darling believe me,  
For me there is no one  
For me there is no one  
But you.  
But you.
