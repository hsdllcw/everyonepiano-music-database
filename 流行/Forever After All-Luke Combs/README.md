### Forever After All歌词：

A cold beer's got twelve ounces  
A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand  
You only get so much until it's gone  
Duracells in a Maglite  
A needle drop on a forty-five  
All the kinda things that only last so long  
When the new wears off and they get to getting old  
Sooner or later time's gonna take its toll  
They say nothing lasts forever  
But they ain't seen us together  
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes  
Just a t-shirt in the kitchen  
With no make-up and a million  
Other things that I could look at my whole life  
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts  
Maybe some things last forever after all  
The FM station on the outskirts  
Blue jeans after years of shift work  
All fading out like I always knew they would  
The strings on this guitar  
The first love lost on a young heart  
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good  
'Cause the new wears off and they get to getting old  
Yeah sooner or later time's gonna take its toll  
They say nothing lasts forever  
But they ain't seen us together  
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes  
Just a t-shirt in the kitchen  
With no make-up and a million  
Other things that I could look at my whole life  
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts  
Maybe some things last forever after all  
They say nothing lasts forever  
But they ain't seen us together  
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes  
And I know there'll be that moment  
The good Lord calls one of us home and  
One won't have the other by their side  
But Heaven knows it that won't last too long  
Maybe some things last forever after all  
After all
