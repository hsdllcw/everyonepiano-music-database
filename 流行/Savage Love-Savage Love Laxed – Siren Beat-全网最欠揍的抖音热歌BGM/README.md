### Savage Love歌词：

Jason Derulo  
Ahh  
Savage love  
It's 685 baby  
If I woke up without ya I don't know what I would do  
Thought I could be single forever till I met you  
Usually don't be fallin' be fallin' fallin' first  
You gotta way of keeping me comin' back to back  
I just found out the only reason that you lovin' me  
Was to get back at your ex lover but before you leave  
Usually I would never would never even care  
Baby I know she creepin' I feel it in the air  
Every night and every day  
Every day  
I try to make you stay  
But your  
Savage love  
Did somebody did somebody  
Break your heart  
Lookin' like an angel  
But your savage love  
But when you kiss me  
I know you don't give two f**ks  
But I still want that  
Your savage love  
Your savage lo-lo-love  
Your savage lo-lo-love  
You could use me  
'Cause I still want that  
Your savage  
Baby I hope this ain't karma 'cause I get around  
You wanna run it up I wanna lock it down  
Usually don't be fallin' be fallin' fallin' first  
You gotta way of making me spend up all my cash  
Every night and every day  
Every day  
I try to make you stay  
But your  
Savage love  
Did somebody did somebody  
Break your heart  
Lookin' like an angel  
But your savage love  
But when you kiss me  
I know you don't give two f**ks  
But I still want that  
Your savage love  
Your savage lo-lo-love  
Ohh  
Your savage lo-lo-love  
You could use me  
'Cause I still want that your savage love  
Ooh la-la-la-la ooh la-la-la-la  
Your savage lo-lo-love  
Ooh la-la-la-la  
Your savage lo-lo-love  
You could use me  
Ooh la-la-la-la  
Baby  
Savage love  
Oh girl  
Did somebody did somebody  
Break your heart  
Lookin' like an angel  
But your savage love  
Savage love  
But when you kiss me  
I know you don't give two f**ks  
But I still want that  
Your savage love  
Savage love  
Your savage lo-lo-love  
Ooh yeah  
Your savage lo-lo-love  
Girl you could use me  
'Cause I still want that your savage love
