### 8 Letters歌词：

You know me the best  
You know my worst, see me hurt, but you don't judge  
That, right there, is the scariest feeling  
Opening and closing up again  
I've been hurt so I don't trust  
Now here we are, staring at the ceiling  
I've said those words before but it was a lie  
And you deserve to hear them a thousand times  
If all it is is eight letters  
Why is it so hard to say?  
If all it is is eight letters  
Why am I in my own way?  
Why do I pull you close  
And then ask you for space  
If all it is is eight letters  
Why is it so hard to say?  
Isn't it amazing how almost every line on our hands align  
When your hands are mine  
It's like I'm whole again, isn't that a sign  
I should speak my mind  
I've said those words before but it was a lie  
And you deserve to hear them a thousand times  
If all it is is eight letters  
Why is it so hard to say?  
If all it is is eight letters  
Why am I in my own way?  
Why do I pull you close  
And then ask you for space?  
If all it is is eight letters  
Why is it so hard to say? (whoa oh, yeah)  
When I close my eyes  
It's you there in my mind  
When I close my eyes  
If all it is is eight letters  
Why is it so hard to say?  
If all it is is eight letters  
Why am I in my own way?  
Why do I pull you close  
And then ask you for space  
If all it is is eight letters  
Why is it so hard to say?  
If all it is is eight letters  
When I close my eyes  
It's you there in my mind (It's only you)  
When I close my eyes  
If all it is is eight letters  
When I close my eyes  
It's you there in my mind (you)  
When I close my eyes  
If all it is is eight letters
