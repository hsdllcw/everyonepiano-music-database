### Another Brick in the Wall歌词：

We don't need no education  
We don't need no thought control  
No dark sarcasm in the classroom  
Teachers leave them kids alone  
Hey teacher leave them kids alone  
All in all it's just another brick in the wall  
All in all you're just another brick in the wall

We don't need no education  
We don't need no thought control  
No dark sarcasm in the classroom  
Teachers leave them kids alone  
Hey teacher leave us kids alone  
All in all you're just another brick in the wall  
All in all you're just another brick in the wall
