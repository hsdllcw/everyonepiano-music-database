### What Ifs歌词：

You say what if I hurt you what if I leave you  
What if I find somebody else and I don't need you  
What if this goes south what if I mess you up  
You say what if I break your heart in two then what  
Well I hear you girl I feel you girl but not so fast  
Before you make your mind up I gotta ask  
What if I was made for you and you were made for me  
What if this is it what if it's meant to be  
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game  
What if I just pull you close what if I lean in  
And the stars line up and it's our last first kiss  
What if one of these days baby I go and change your name  
What if I loved all these what ifs away  
What if the sky falls  
Sky falls  
Or the sun stops burnin'  
We could worry about them what ifs 'til the world stops turnin'  
Or I could kiss you  
You should kiss me  
What if you liked it  
Bet I'd like it  
Well we ain't never gonna know unless we try it  
What if I was made for you and you were made for me  
What if this is it what if it's meant to be  
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game  
What if I just pull you close what if I lean in  
And the stars line up and it's our last first kiss  
What if one of these days baby I go and change your name  
What if I loved all these what ifs away  
Awe yeah  
Come on  
You say what if I hurt you what if I leave you  
What if I find somebody else and I don't need you  
Damn  
What if I was made for you and you were made for me  
What if this is it what if it's meant to be  
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game  
What if I just pull you close what if I lean in  
And the stars line up and it's our last first kiss  
What if one of these days baby I go and change your name  
What if I loved all these what ifs away  
Away  
Away  
What if
