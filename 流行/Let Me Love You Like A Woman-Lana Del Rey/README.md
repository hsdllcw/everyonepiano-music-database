**Let Me Love You Like A Woman** 是美国女歌手Lana Del
Rey演唱的一首歌曲，作为单曲于2020年10月16日发行。慵懒迷幻的嗓音和带有甜蜜苦涩参半的气息，与歌曲柔和的氛围相得益彰，蜕变为完美女人的Lana
Del Rey更加懂得如何去爱~

如果这是新专曲目顺序第一首的话，这会是一首很好的开场曲或Interlude，或许它的旋律些许平淡，但它琅琅上口，承接了NFR的感觉，歌词中提及LA，以洛杉矶为起点，离开LA之后你会去往何方，让人遐想。Lana
Del Rey说创作这张辑期间去游历拜访了美国很多地方，遇见了很多朋友，也有很多想法，这张专辑对这一段经历也会有所体现，故事仍然在继续……

### Let Me Love You Like A Woman歌词：

I come from a small town how 'bout you  
I only mention it 'cause I'm ready to leave LA  
And I want you to come  
Eighty miles North or South will do  
I don't care where as long as you're with me  
And I'm with you and you let me  
Let me love you like a woman  
Let me hold you like a baby  
Let me shine like a diamond  
Let me be who I'm meant to be  
Talk to me in poems and songs  
Don't make me be bittersweet  
Let me love you like a woman  
Let me hold you like a baby  
Let me hold you like a baby  
I come from a small town far away  
I only mention it 'cause I'm ready to leave LA  
And I need you to come  
And I want you to come  
I guess I could manage if you stay  
It's just if you do I can't see myself having any fun so  
Let me love you like a woman  
Let me hold you like a baby  
Let me shine like a diamond  
Let me be who I'm meant to be  
Talk to me in songs and poems  
Don't make me be bittersweet  
Let me love you like a woman  
Take you to infinity  
Let me love you like a woman  
Let me hold you like a baby  
Take you to infinity  
Let me love you like a woman  
Let me hold you like a baby  
Take you to infinity  
We could get lost in the purple rain  
Talk about the good ol' days  
We could get high on some pink champagne  
Baby let me count the waves  
Let me love you like a woman  
Let me hold you like a baby  
Let me shine like a diamond  
Let me be who I'm meant to be  
Talk to me in songs and poems  
Don't make me be bittersweet  
Let me love you like a woman
