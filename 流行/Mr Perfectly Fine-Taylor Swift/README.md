**Mr. Perfectly Fine** 是由美国女歌手Taylor
Swift录唱的一首歌曲，被收录在Taylor第二张录音室专辑《Fearless》的重制版唱片。

Taylor真的是旋律写作的高手，熟悉的明媚可爱的Country
Pop，还用摇滚加以点缀，让这对于一段感情告别的悲伤口吻充满重生的活力与韧劲。Hello转至Goodbye的叙事推动，Casually Cruel是和All
Too Well的互文，Perfectly Fine的双关还是流露着些许青涩少女的俏皮智慧，又嗅到了她那时音乐里独有的朴实清新的新生力量，好感动。

### Mr. Perfectly Fine歌词：

Mr. perfect face  
Mr. here to stay  
Mr. looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away  
Everything was right  
Mr. I've been waiting for you all my life  
Mr. every single day until the end I will be by your side  
But that was when I got to know  
Mr. change of heart  
Mr. leaves me all alone  
I fall apart  
It takes everything in me just to get up each day  
But it's wonderful to see that you're okay  
Hello Mr. perfectly fine  
How's your heart after breaking mine  
Mr. always at the right place at the right time baby  
Hello Mr. casually cruel  
Mr. everything revolves around you  
I've been Miss misery since your goodbye  
And you're Mr. perfectly fine  
Mr. never told me why  
Mr. never had to see me cry  
Mr. insincere apology so he doesn't look like the bad guy  
He goes about his day  
Forgets he ever even heard my name  
Well I thought you might be different than the rest  
I guess you're all the same  
Because I hear he's got his arm 'round a brand new girl  
I've been picking up my heart  
He's been picking up her  
And I never got past what you put me through  
But it's wonderful to see that it never phased you  
Hello Mr. perfectly fine  
How's your heart after breaking mine  
Mr. always at the right place at the right time baby  
Hello Mr. casually cruel  
Mr. everything revolves around you  
I've been Miss misery since your goodbye  
And you're Mr. perfectly fine  
So dignified in your well pressed suit  
So strategized  
All the eyes on you  
Sashay away to your seat  
It's the best seat  
In the best room  
Oh he's so smug  
Mr. always wins  
So far above me in every sense  
So far above feeling anything  
And it's really such a shame  
It's such a shame  
Cause I was Miss here to stay  
Now I'm Miss gonna be alright someday  
And someday maybe you'll miss me  
But by then you'll be Mr. too late  
Goodbye Mr. perfectly fine  
How's your heart after breaking mine  
Mr. always at the right place at the right time baby  
Goodbye Mr. casually cruel  
Mr. everything revolves around you  
I've been Miss misery for the last time  
And you're Mr. perfectly fine  
You're perfectly fine  
Mr. look me in the eye and tell me you would never go away  
You said you'd never go away
