### Formation歌词：

[Intro: Messy Mya]  
What happened at the New Wil’ins?  
Bitch, I'm back by popular demand

[Refrain: Beyoncé]  
Y'all haters corny with that illuminati mess  
Paparazzi, catch my fly, and my cocky fresh  
I'm so reckless when I rock my Givenchy dress (stylin')  
I'm so possessive so I rock his Roc necklaces  
My daddy Alabama, Momma Louisiana  
You mix that negro with that Creole make a Texas bama  
I like my baby heir with baby hair and afros  
I like my negro nose with Jackson Five nostrils  
Earned all this money but they never take the country out me  
I got a hot sauce in my bag, swag

[Interlude: Messy Mya + Big Freedia]  
Oh yeah, baby, oh yeah I, ohhhhh, oh, yes, I like that  
I did not come to play with you hoes, haha  
I came to slay, bitch  
I like cornbreads and collard greens, bitch  
Oh, yes, you besta believe it

[Refrain: Beyoncé]  
Y'all haters corny with that illuminati mess  
Paparazzi, catch my fly, and my cocky fresh  
I'm so reckless when I rock my Givenchy dress (stylin')  
I'm so possessive so I rock his Roc necklaces  
My daddy Alabama, Momma Louisiana  
You mix that negro with that Creole make a Texas bama  
I like my baby heir with baby hair and afros  
I like my negro nose with Jackson Five nostrils  
Earned all this money but they never take the country out me  
I got a hot sauce in my bag, swag

[Chorus: Beyoncé]  
I see it, I want it, I stunt, yellow-bone it  
I dream it, I work hard, I grind 'til I own it  
I twirl on them haters, albino alligators  
El Camino with the seat low, sippin' Cuervo with no chaser  
Sometimes I go off (I go off), I go hard (I go hard)  
Get what's mine (take what's mine), I'm a star (I'm a star)  
Cause I slay (slay), I slay (hey), I slay (okay), I slay (okay)  
All day (okay), I slay (okay), I slay (okay), I slay (okay)  
We gon' slay (slay), gon' slay (okay), we slay (okay), I slay (okay)  
I slay (okay), okay (okay), I slay (okay), okay, okay, okay, okay  
Okay, okay, ladies, now let's get in formation, cause I slay  
Okay, ladies, now let's get in formation, cause I slay  
Prove to me you got some coordination, cause I slay  
Slay trick, or you get eliminated

[Verse: Beyoncé]  
When he fuck me good I take his ass to Red Lobster, cause I slay  
When he fuck me good I take his ass to Red Lobster, cause I slay  
If he hit it right, I might take him on a flight on my chopper, cause I slay  
Drop him off at the mall, let him buy some J's, let him shop up, cause I slay  
I might get your song played on the radio station, cause I slay  
I might get your song played on the radio station, cause I slay  
You just might be a black Bill Gates in the making, cause I slay  
I just might be a black Bill Gates in the making

[Chorus: Beyoncé]  
I see it, I want it, I stunt, yellow-bone it  
I dream it, I work hard, I grind 'til I own it  
I twirl on my haters, albino alligators  
El Camino with the seat low, sippin' Cuervo with no chaser  
Sometimes I go off (I go off), I go hard (I go hard)  
Get what's mine (take what's mine), I'm a star (I'm a star)  
Cause I slay (slay), I slay (hey), I slay (okay), I slay (okay)  
All day (okay), I slay (okay), I slay (okay), I slay (okay)  
We gon' slay (slay), gon' slay (okay), we slay (okay), I slay (okay)  
I slay (okay), okay (okay), I slay (okay), okay, okay, okay, okay  
Okay, okay, ladies, now let's get in formation, cause I slay  
Okay, ladies, now let's get in formation, cause I slay  
Prove to me you got some coordination, cause I slay  
Slay trick, or you get eliminated

[Bridge: Beyoncé]  
Okay, ladies, now let's get in formation, I slay  
Okay, ladies, now let's get in formation  
You know you that bitch when you cause all this conversation  
Always stay gracious, best revenge is your paper

[Outro:]  
Girl, I hear some thunder  
Golly, look at that water, boy, oh lord
