### Wasted on You歌词：

I don't always wake up in the mornin'  
Pour myself a strong one  
Aw but when I get lonely I do  
Your memory gets burnin'  
Lean back on the bourbon  
Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you  
Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again  
It's all my fault  
Yeah I dropped the ball  
You're gone and I've gone three sheets to the wind  
Just thinking 'bout all I've wasted on you  
All of this time and all of this money  
All of these sorries I don't owe you honey  
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew  
All them days I spent wasted on you  
Wasted on you  
Yeah I swore this would be different  
My heart wouldn't listen to my head and these boots on my feet  
Looks like I'm learning the hard way again  
That's why I've been  
Wasted on you  
All of this time and all of this money  
And all these sorries I don't owe you honey  
All of these miles on this chevy and prayers in a pew  
All them days I spent wasted on you  
Wasted on you  
Like the pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back right  
Down to the strike of this match  
Wasted on you  
Wasted on you wasted on you  
Wasted on you wasted on you  
All of this time and all of this money  
All of these sorries I don't owe you honey  
All of these miles on this chevy and prayers in a pew  
All them nights I spent wasted on you wasted on you  
Wasted on you wasted on you
