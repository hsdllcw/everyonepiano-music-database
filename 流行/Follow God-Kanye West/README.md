_Follow God_ 收录在Kanye West的专辑《Jesus is King》中。这张专辑Kanye
West完全像变了个人一样，每天都在宣传爱与和平。而歌曲MV，这次是与他的父亲Ray West 一起出演，展现父子情深，Kanye
开着载具带着父亲在自己位于怀俄明的农场里驰骋，像个小孩子为父亲炫耀自己的玩具一般纯真。最后 Kanye
写道：「我爸来到我在怀俄明科迪的一座农场看我，他告诉我他有多喜欢钓鱼，他很愿意夏天来这里玩。我用了 42 年才发现我爸是我最好的朋友。

### Follow God歌词：

Father I stretch  
Stretch my hands to you  
Lifelike this is what your life like  
Try to live your life right  
People really know you  
Push your buttons like type write  
This is like a movie  
But it's really very lifelike  
Every single night right  
Every single fight right  
I was looking at the 'Gram and I don't even like likes  
I was screamin' at my Dad he told me  
It ain't Christ-like  
I was screamin' at the referee just like Mike  
Lookin' for a bright light  
Sigel what your life like  
Riding on a white bike  
Feeling like excite bike  
Pressin' on the gas supernova for a night light  
Screamin' at my dad and he told me  
It ain't Christ-like  
But nobody never tell you when you're being like Christ  
Only ever seein' me only when they needin' me  
Like if Tyler Perry made a movie for BET  
Searchin' for a deity now you wanna see it free  
Now you wanna see if we  
Let's just see if three a piece  
Tell me what your life like turn it down a bright light  
Drivin' with my dad and he told me  
It ain't Christ-like  
I'm just tryna find  
I've been lookin' for a new way  
I'm just really tryna not to really do the fool way  
I don't have a cool way  
Bein' on my best though  
Block 'em on the text though  
Nothin' else next though  
Not another word letter picture or a decimal  
Wrestlin' with God I don't really want to wrestle  
Man it's really lifelike everything in my life  
Arguing with my dad and he said  
It ain't Christ-like  
Man  
You know it's like  
Somebody only close who can get you like off your  
I be on my  
I woke up this morning I said my prayers  
I'm all good then I tried to talk to my dad  
Give him some advice he starts spazzin' on me  
I start spazzin' back He said That ain't Christ-like  
I said Aaah
