### Not 20 Anymore歌词：

No I'm not 20 anymore  
Don't try to make me feel insecure  
'Cause if one thing's for sure  
I don't wanna be  
I feel so good in my skin  
Skin  
Should I let you go or should I let you in  
Oh baby don't need no one to show me what to do yeah  
Beauty's more than a number  
When I was younger I didn't know that  
And if you gave me the chance I wouldn't go back  
Back back  
No I'm not 20 anymore  
20 anymore  
Don't try to make me feel insecure  
'Cause I'm aging like wine  
I get better with time yes I do  
Yes I do  
And oh I'm not 20 anymore  
20 anymore  
The lines on my face they weren't there before  
But I'm wiser I'm stronger from all of the life I've been through  
I've been through  
Oh and if one thing's for sure  
I don't wanna be 20 anymore  
Why lie 'bout how old I am  
I am am  
When I'm a better lover than I was in 2010  
Oh baby let me show you all the things my body do yeah  
Beauty's more than a number  
When I was younger I wish I knew that  
And now I'm not afraid won't hold myself back  
Back back  
No I'm not 20 anymore  
20 anymore  
Don't try to make me feel insecure  
'Cause I'm aging like wine  
I get better with time yes I do  
Yes I do  
And oh I'm not 20 anymore  
20 anymore  
The lines on my face they weren't there before  
But I'm wiser I'm stronger from all of the life I've been through  
I've been through  
Oh and if one thing's for sure  
I don't want to be 20 anymore  
Oh oh-oh  
Oh oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh-oh
