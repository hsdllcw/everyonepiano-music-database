### Break My Heart歌词：

I've always been the one to say the first goodbye  
Had to love and lose a hundred million times  
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like  
Now I'm falling  
You say my name like I have never heard before  
I'm indecisive but this time I know for sure  
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all  
Are you falling  
Centre of attention  
You know you can get whatever you want from me  
Whenever you want it baby  
It's you in my reflection  
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me  
If I woulda known it baby  
I would've stayed at home  
Cuz I was doing better alone  
But when you said hello  
I knew that was the end of it all  
I should've stayed at home  
Cuz now there ain't no letting you go  
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart  
Oh no  
I was doing better alone  
But when you said hello  
I knew that was the end of it all  
I should've stayed at home  
Cuz now there ain't no letting you go  
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart  
I wonder when you go if I stay on your mind  
Two can play that game but you win me every time  
Everyone before you was a waste of time  
Yeah you got me  
Centre of attention  
You know you can get whatever you want from me  
Whenever you want it baby  
It's you in my reflection  
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me  
If I woulda known it baby  
I would've stayed at home  
Cuz I was doing better alone  
But when you said hello  
I knew that was the end of it all  
I should've stayed at home  
Cuz now there ain't no letting you go  
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart  
Oh no  
I was doing better alone  
But when you said hello  
I knew that was the end of it all  
I should've stayed at home  
Cuz now there ain't no letting you go  
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart  
Ooooh break my heart  
Ooooh break my heart  
Ooooh  
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart  
I would've stayed at home  
Cuz I was doing better alone  
But when you said hello  
I knew that was the end of it all  
I should've stayed at home  
Cuz now there ain't no letting you go  
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart  
Oh no  
I was doing better alone  
But when you said hello  
I knew that was the end of it all  
I should've stayed at home  
Cuz now there ain't no letting you go  
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart
