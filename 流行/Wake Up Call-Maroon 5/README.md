### Wake Up Call歌词：

[Verse]

I didn't hear what you were saying.  
I live on raw emotion baby  
I answer questions never maybe  
And I'm not kind if you betray me.  
So who the hell are you to say we  
Never would have made it babe.

[Bridge]

If you needed love  
Well then ask for love  
Could have given love  
Now I’m taking love  
And it’s not my fault  
Cause you both deserve  
What is coming now  
So don’t say a word

[Chorus]

Wake up call  
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed  
Don't you care about me anymore?  
Don’t you care about me? I don't think so.  
Six foot tall  
Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead  
He won't come around here anymore  
Come around here? I don't think so.

[Breakdown]

Would have bled to make you happy  
You didn't need to treat me that way  
And now you beat me at my own game  
And now I find you sleeping soundly  
And your lovers screaming loudly  
Hear a sound and hit the ground

[Bridge]

If you needed love  
Well then ask for love  
Could have given love  
Now I’m taking love  
And it’s not my fault  
Cause you both deserve  
What’s coming now

So don’t say a word

[Chorus]

Wake up call  
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed  
Don't you care about me anymore?  
Don’t you care about me? I don't think so.  
Six foot tall  
Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead  
He won't come around here anymore  
Come around here?  
I don’t feel so bad, I don’t feel so bad, I don’t feel so bad

[Breakdown]

I'm so sorry darling  
Did I do the wrong thing?  
Oh, what was I thinking?  
Is his heart still beating?

Woah oh ohh

[Chorus]

Wake up call  
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed  
Don't you care about me anymore?  
Don’t you care about me? I don't think so.  
Six foot tall  
Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead  
He won't come around here anymore  
Come around here anymore? I don’t feel so bad

Wake up call  
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed  
Don’t you care about me anymore?  
Don’t you care about me? I don’t think so.  
Six foot tall  
Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead  
He won’t come around here anymore  
No, he won’t come around here. I don’t feel so bad

I don’t feel so bad (Wake up call)  
I don’t feel so bad (Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed)  
I don’t feel so bad (Don’t you care about me anymore?)  
Care about me? I don’t feel so bad.  
Wake up call  
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed  
Don't you care about me anymore?
