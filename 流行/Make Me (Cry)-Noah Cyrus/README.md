### Make Me (Cry)歌词：

I never needed you like I do right now  
I never needed you like I do right now  
I never hated you like I do right now  
'Cause all you ever do is make me...  
Gave you up 'bout 21 times  
Felt those lips, tell me 21 lies, yeah  
You'll be the death of me  
Sage advice  
Love-lovin' you could make Jesus cry  
When I hear you're sayin' "Darling,  
Your kiss is like an antidote."  
I'm fightin' like I'm Ali,  
But you got me on the ropes  
I never needed you like I do right now  
I never needed you like I do right now  
I never hated you like I do right now  
'Cause all you ever do is make me...  
Couldn't hear the thunder  
But I heard your heart race  
Couldn't see the rain  
We're too busy makin' hurricanes, yeah  
Love ain't easy when it ain't my way  
But it gets hard, when you ain't here makin' me crazy  
Baby, say the word, darlin'  
You know just how to hold the sucker down  
So I see you in the morning  
I can't watch you walk out  
I never needed you like I do right now  
I never needed you like I do right now  
I never hated you like I do right now  
'Cause all you ever do is make me...  
Cry  
Cry  
Cry  
Hear the thunder  
See the rain  
Yeah  
Keep on makin' me cry  
Yeah  
Hey, hey, yeah  
Keep makin' me scream and holler  
Keep on makin' me cry  
You don't know what you're doin' to me  
Hey, hey, yeah  
Yeah  
I never needed you like I do right now  
I never needed you like I do right now  
I never hated you like I do right now  
'Cause all you ever do is make me
