Cardi B携手Megan Thee Stallion的单曲《 **WAP**
》成为2020年单周销量最高的单曲，首周销量折合80万，已经认证了黄金唱片。而发行第八天销量已经突破了一百万张，成为百万单曲。

其实 _WAP_ 这个单词是Watermelon（西瓜），Apple（苹果）和Pineapple（菠萝）的组合单词，单曲名称就叫做《西瓜苹果菠萝》。

这是因为Cardi B 热爱水果，喜欢吃水果，她希望自己能成为水果姐的妹妹水果妹，所以用西瓜苹果菠萝来命名自己的新单曲。

### WAP歌词：

Frank Ski：  
W***es in this house  
There's some w***es in this house  
There's some w***es in this house  
There's some w***es in this house  
Cardi B/Megan Thee Stallion：  
I said certified freak seven days a week  
Wet-a*s p***y make that pullout game weak  
Ah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah you f**kin' with some wet-a*s p***y  
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet-a*s p***y  
Give me everything you got for this wet-a*s p***y  
Cardi B：  
Beat it up n***a catch a charge  
Extra large and extra hard  
Put this p***y right in your face  
Swipe your nose like a credit card  
Hop on top I wanna ride  
I do a kegel while it's inside  
Spit in my mouth look in my eyes  
This p***y is wet come take a dive  
Tie me up like I'm surprised  
Let's roleplay I'll wear a disguise  
I want you to park that big Mack truck right in this little garage  
Make it cream make me scream  
Out in public make a scene  
I don't cook I don't clean  
But let me tell you how I got this ring  
Megan Thee Stallion：  
Gobble me swallow me drip down the side of me  
Quick jump out 'fore you let you get inside of me  
Yeah  
I tell him where to put it never tell him where I'm 'bout to be  
I'll run down on him 'fore I have a n***a runnin' me  
Talk your s**t bite your lip  
Ask for a car while you ride that d**k  
While you ride that d**k  
You really ain't never gotta f**k him for a thang  
He already made his mind up 'fore he came  
Ayy uh  
Now get your boots and your coat for this wet-a*s p***y  
He bought a phone just for pictures of this wet-a*s p***y  
Click click  
Pay my tuition just to kiss me on this wet-a*s p***y  
Now make it rain if you wanna see some wet-a*s p***y  
Cardi B：  
Look I need a hard hitter need a deep stroker  
Need a Henny drinker need a w**d smoker  
Not a garter snake I need a king cobra  
With a hook in it hope it lean over  
He got some money then that's where I'm headed  
P***y A1 just like his credit  
He got a beard well I'm tryna wet it  
I let him taste it now he diabetic  
I don't wanna spit I wanna gulp  
I wanna gag I wanna choke  
I want you to touch that lil' dangly thing  
That swing in the back of my throat  
My head game is fire punani Dasani  
It's goin' in dry and it's comin' out soggy  
I ride on that thing like the cops is behind me  
I spit on his mic and now he tryna sign me woo  
Megan Thee Stallion：  
Your honor I'm a freak b***h handcuffs leashes  
Switch my wig make him feel like he cheatin'  
Put him on his knees give him somethin' to believe in  
Never lost a fight but I'm looking for a beating  
In the food chain I'm the one that eat ya  
If he ate my a*s he's a bottom-feeder  
Big D stand for big demeanor  
I could make ya bust before I ever meet ya  
If it don't hang then he can't bang  
You can't hurt my feelings but I like pain  
If he f**k me and ask "Whose is it"  
When I ride the d**k I'ma spell my name ah  
Cardi B：  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah you f**kin' with some wet-a*s p***y  
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet-a*s p***y  
Give me everything you got for this wet-a*s p***y  
Now from the top make it drop that's some wet-a*s p***y  
Now get a bucket and a mop that's some wet-a*s p***y  
I'm talkin' wap wap wap that's some wet-a*s p***y  
Macaroni in a pot that's some wet-a*s p***y huh  
Frank Ski：  
There's some w***es in this house  
There's some w***es in this house  
There's some w***es in this house  
There's some w***es in this house  
There's some w***es in this house  
There's some w***es in this house  
There's some w***es in this house  
There's some w***es in this house  
There's some w***es in this house  
There's some w***es in this house
