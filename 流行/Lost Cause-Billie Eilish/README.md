Ever中。此曲如同即将到来的夏季一般热情似火，点燃了整个夏日。

Billie
Eilish，美国女歌手、词曲作者、模特。她这种略带沙哑并和气声充分混合的，听似柔软无芯但却具有弹性的声音正是时髦的。这种声线和饱满的电子音乐以及狂躁的舞蹈所形成的融合与反差，正是Billie
Eilish独特魅力的核心。

### Lost Cause歌词：

Something's in the  
Something's in the air right now  
Like I'm losin' track of time time time  
Like I don't really care right now  
But maybe that's fine  
You weren't even there that day  
I was waitin' on you you you  
I wonder if you were aware that day  
Was the last straw for me and I know  
I sent you flowers  
Did you even care  
You ran to shower  
And left them by the stairs  
Ooh-ooh-ooh a-a-a-ayy  
Thought you had your s**t together  
But d**n I was wrong wrong  
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause cause cause  
And this ain't nothin' like it once was was was  
I know you think you're such an outlaw  
But you got no job job  
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause cause  
And this ain't nothin' like it once was was  
I know you think you're such an outlaw  
But you got no job  
I used to think you were shy shy  
But maybe you just had nothing on your mind  
Maybe you were thinkin' 'bout yourself all the time  
I used to wish you were mine mine  
But that was way before I realized  
Someone like you would always be so easy to find  
So so easy so so  
Ea- mm mm  
Gave me no flowers  
Wish I didn't care  
You'd been gone for hours  
Could be anywhere  
I I I  
Thought you would've grown eventually  
But you proved me wrong wrong  
You ain't nothing but a lost cause cause  
And this ain't nothing like it once was was  
I know you think you're such an outlaw yeah  
But you got no job no job  
You ain't nothing but a lost cause cause  
And this ain't nothing like it once was was  
I know you think you're such an outlaw  
Think you're such an outlaw  
But you got no job  
What did I tell you  
Don't get complacent  
It's time to face it now na-na na-na na-na  
What did I tell you  
Don't get complacent  
It's time to face it now na-na na-na na-na
