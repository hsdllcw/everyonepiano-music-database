**This Love** 是美国女歌手Taylor
Swift演唱，收录在她的第五张录音室专辑《1989》里面，亦是这张专辑中唯一一首由Taylor独立创作的歌曲。《1989》在美国发行首日便获得了60万张的专辑销量，上市首周销量累计达128.7万张，并凭借366万张的销量成为2014年最畅销的专辑，Taylor也因此成为了专辑榜史上唯一一位拥有3张专辑首周销量都破百万的歌手。

《 _This Love_ 》是流行专辑中都会有的ballad，不同的是歌曲氛围的营造和合成器的运用让这首歌的逼格较普通烂大街的抒情歌高了那么一点点。

### This Love歌词：

Clear blue water  
湛蓝海水  
High tide came and brought you in  
潮起潮落 待君归来  
And i could go ,on and on, on and on And i will,  
我心永恒，只为你留  
skies grew darker, currents swept you out again  
夜色渐浓，目送君走  
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone  
无力挽留  
In silent screams, in wildest dreams  
无声呐喊，击碎心墙  
I never dreamed of this  
未曾预料  
This love is good  
爱像天堂  
This love is bad  
爱如炼狱  
This love is alive back from the dead，oh  
涅槃重生  
These hands had to let it go free  
被迫放手  
And this love came back to me,oh,oh,oh  
袭上心头  
Tossing, turning, struggled through the night wIth someone new  
辗转反侧，痴等君归  
And I could go on and on , on and on  
唯有前行，绝无后路  
lantern, burning, flickered in the mind only you  
烛火摇曳，英姿重现  
But you were still gone , gone , gone  
奈斯人已逝  
Been losing grip, on sinking ships  
夜不能寐，坠入深渊  
You showed up just in time  
正是那时，你又出现  
This love is good  
爱是天堂  
This love is bad  
爱如炼狱  
This love is alive back from the dead，oh  
涅槃重生  
These hands had to let it go free  
被迫放手  
And this love came back to me  
袭上心头  
This love left a permanent mark  
永不磨灭  
This love is glowing in the dark  
独自放光  
These hands had to let it go free  
被迫放手  
And this love came back to me  
犹在心里住  
Your kiss，my cheek  
绵绵细吻 轻落脸颊  
I watched you leave  
目送君去  
Your smile, my ghost  
笑意冉冉 未曾相忘  
I fell to my knees  
无助 悲伤  
When you're young , you just run  
风华正茂 奔向远方  
But you come back to what You need  
却又跑向 你需要的地方  
This love is good  
爱是天堂  
This love is bad  
爱如炼狱  
This love is alIve back from the dead，oh  
涅槃重生  
These hands had to let it go free  
食指微动 让爱自由  
And this love came back to me  
却袭上心头  
This love left a permanent mark  
永世铭记  
This love is glowing in the dark  
爱既是光  
These hands had to let it go free  
看君离去 未曾回头  
And this love came back to me  
伊人在梦中
