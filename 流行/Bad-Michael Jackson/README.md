### Bad歌词：

Your butt is mine  
Gonna tell you right  
Just show your face in broad daylight  
I'm telling you on how I feel  
Gonna hurt your mind  
Don't shoot to kill  
Come on  
Come on  
Lay it on me  
All right  
I'm giving you on count of three  
To show your stuff or let it be  
I'm telling you  
Just watch your mouth  
I know your game  
What you're about  
They say the sky's the limit  
And to me that's really true  
My friend  
You have seen nothing  
Just wait 'til I get through  
Because I'm bad  
I'm bad come on  
Really really bad  
You know I'm bad  
I'm bad you know it  
Really really bad  
You know I'm bad  
I'm bad come on  
Really really bad  
And the whole world has to answer right now  
Just to tell you once again who's bad  
The word is out  
You're doin' wrong  
Gonna lock you up before too long  
Your lyin' eyes gonna tell you right  
So listen up  
Don't make a fight  
Your talk is cheap  
You're not a man  
You're throwin' stones to hide your hands  
They say the sky's the limit  
And to me that's really true  
My friend  
You have seen nothing  
Just wait 'til I get through  
Because I'm bad  
I'm bad come on  
Really really bad  
You know I'm bad  
I'm bad you know it  
Really really bad  
You know I'm bad  
I'm bad you know  
Really really bad  
And the whole world has to answer right now  
Just to tell you once again who's bad  
We can change the world tomorrow  
This could be a better place  
If you don't like what I'm sayin'  
Then won't you slap my face  
Because I'm bad  
I'm bad come on  
Really really bad  
You know I'm bad  
I'm bad you know it  
Really really bad  
You know I'm bad  
I'm bad you know  
Really really bad  
And the whole world has to answer right now  
Just to tell you once again  
You know I'm bad  
I'm bad come on  
Really really bad  
You know I'm bad  
I'm bad you know it  
Really really bad  
You know it you know you know you know  
Come on  
And the whole world has to answer right now  
Just to tell you once again  
You know I'm smooth  
I'm bad you know it  
Really really bad  
You know I'm bad  
I'm bad  
Really really bad  
You know  
You know it come on  
And the whole world has to answer right now  
Just to tell you once again  
You know I'm bad  
I'm bad you know it  
Really really bad  
You know I'm bad  
You know  
Really really bad  
You know I'm bad  
I'm bad you know it  
Really really bad  
And the whole world has to answer right now  
Just to tell you once again  
Who's bad
