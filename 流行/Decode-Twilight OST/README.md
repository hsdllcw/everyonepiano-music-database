### Decode歌词：

How can I decide what's right  
When you're clouding up my mind?  
I can't win  
You're losing fight  
All the time  
Not gonna ever own what's mine  
When you're always taking sides  
But you won't take away my pride  
No, not this time  
Not this time  
How did we get here?  
I used to know you so well  
How did we get here?  
Well, I think I know  
The truth is hiding in your eyes  
And it's hanging on your tongue  
Just boiling in my blood  
But you think that I can't see  
What kind of man that you are  
If you're a man at all  
Well, I will figure this one out  
On my own  
(I'm screaming, "I love you so")  
(My thoughts you can't decode)  
How did we get here?  
I used to know you so well, yeah  
How did we get here?  
Well, I think I know  
Do you see what we've done?  
We've gone and made such fools  
Of ourselves  
Do you see what we've done?  
We've gone and made such fools  
Of ourselves  
How did we get here?  
I used to know you so well, yeah  
How did we get here?  
Well, I used to know you so well  
I think I know  
I think I know  
There is something I see in you  
It might kill me  
I want it to be true
