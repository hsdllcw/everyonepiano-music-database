**To Build a Home** 是来自杰出氛围/电子乐队The Cinematic
Orchestra的歌曲。他们的作品在采样拼贴的基础之上，融合酸性爵士，弦乐，以及TripHop的缓慢节拍，从而营造出一个游走在电影原声和前卫爵士乐之间的氛围音乐。聆听他们的作品你会明显感受到比一般普通的电影配乐更强烈的张力和感染力。人们讶异于这队玩乐器出身、痴迷录音棚方式的年轻人居然能创作出像老手们一样纯熟的作品，但又极富新意，诀窍当然还是在于技巧。队长Swinscoe首先会从采样中获得一些动机，然后把这些采样交由其他乐手重新演绎，最后再进行拚贴和处理，从而获得这种与众不同的声音，其效果介于未来派爵士乐和原声音乐之间。

### To Build a Home歌词：

There is a house built out of stone  
Wooden floors, walls and window sills...  
Tables and chairs worn by all of the dust...  
This is a place where I don't feel alone  
This is a place where I feel at home...  
Cause, I built a home  
for you  
for me

Until it disappeared  
from me  
from you

And now, it's time to leave and turn to dust...

Out in the garden where we planted the seeds  
There is a tree as old as me  
Branches were sewn by the color of green  
Ground had arose and passed it's knees

By the cracks of the skin I climbed to the top  
I climbed the tree to see the world  
When the gusts came around to blow me down  
I held on as tightly as you held onto me  
I held on as tightly as you held onto me......

Cause, I built a home  
for you  
for me

Until it disappeared  
from me  
from you

And now, it's time to leave and turn to dust......
