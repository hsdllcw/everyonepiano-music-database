### Lean on Me歌词：

Sometimes in our lives  
We all have pain  
We all have sorrow

But if we are wise  
We know that there's  
Always tomorrow

Lean on me, when you're not strong  
And I'll be your friend  
I'll help you carry on

For it won't be long  
Till I'm gonna need  
Somebody to lean on

Please swallow your pride  
If I have things  
You need to borrow

For no one can fill  
Those of your needs  
That you won't let show

You just call on me brother  
When you need a hand  
We all need somebody to lean on

I just might have a problem  
That you'll understand  
We all need somebody to lean on

Lean on me, when you're not strong  
And I'll be your friend  
I'll help you carry on

For it won't be long  
Till I'm gonna need  
Somebody to lean on

You just call on me brother  
When you need a hand  
We all need somebody to lean on

I just might have a problem  
That you'll understand  
We all need somebody to lean on

If there is a load  
You have to bear  
That you can't carry

I'm right up the road  
I'll share your load  
If you just call me

Call me  
If you need a friend  
(Call me)  
Call me  
(Call me)  
If you need a friend  
(Call me)  
If you ever need a friend  
(Call me)

Call me  
(Call me)  
Call me  
(Call me)  
Call me  
(Call me)  
Call me  
(Call me)

If you need a friend  
(Call me)  
Call me  
(Call me)  
Call me  
(Call me)  
Call me  
(Call me)  
Call me  
(Call me)
