### Can't Live Without歌词：

California drivin' had to get out  
Distance got me wonderin' where you are right now  
One-way conversations got me worn down  
Pouring out my heart wish you would speak a sound  
I don't know what I'm after  
I don't know what I'm doin'  
I don't know what I'm after  
All I know is I'm lost  
I don't know what I'm after  
I don't know what I'm doin'  
I don't know what I'm after  
All I know is I'm lost  
Without your love  
There's no point in even wakin' up  
No, no, no, no  
Without your love  
Nothing's ever gonna be enough  
No, no, no, no, no, no  
I can't get you outta my head  
And I don't wanna ever forget  
You give me what the world could never give  
I can't live without your love  
Starin' at the ceiling after midnight  
Over-thinkin' everything in my whole life  
All of these regrets are clouding my mind  
Lord I need the strength to try it one more time  
'Cause now I know what I'm after  
Now I know what I'm doin'  
Now I know what I'm after  
Now I know that I'm lost  
'Cause now I know what I'm after  
Now I know what I'm doin'  
Now I know what I'm after  
Now I know that I'm lost  
Without your love  
There's no point in even wakin' up  
No, no, no, no  
Without your love  
Nothing's ever gonna be enough  
No, no, no, no, no, no  
I can't get you outta my head  
And I don't wanna ever forget  
You give me what the world could never give  
I can't live without your love  
Some people gotta lose it all  
To find out what they really want  
Some people gotta lose it all  
To find out what they really want  
What I want is you  
I can't live without your love
