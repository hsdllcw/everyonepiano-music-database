### A Lie歌词：

[Max B & French Montana:]  
Uh, ball star shit  
(Coke Boy, baby)  
Thought I'd have a little fun with it  
Montana, Montana, ow  
You know what it is when you're hearin' that, haaaaan  
Yep, we gon' get it in, baby  
(La música de Harry Fraud)  
Oh, yeah, baby, yeah  
You bring it back in, skrrt, skrrt  
[The Weeknd:]  
Shawty in the way, got the mothafuckin' fix, yeah  
Sippin' all day got me leanin' off the kickstand  
House on my neck, 'nother house on my wristband  
Girls really love me like a mothafuckin' six pack  
No time for restin' (restin')  
My life's a mess, end up bein' a fuckin' legend (legend)  
An icon, tryna cement it ('ment it)  
I'm treatin' every year like it's game 7 (game 7)  
I feel like problems in my city been deaded (deaded)  
I feel like me and my niggas are unthreatened (threatened)  
My new girl hate it when I'm always spendin' (all the time)  
I guess I gotta get used to it 'cause my ex is  
But it's true, though (but it's true, though)  
But it's true, though (but it's true, though)  
I'm in the cold, rep the north like I'm Trudeau (yeah)  
Yeah it's true, though (true, though)  
Yeah it's true, though (true, though)  
My heart cold but it really beat for you, though  
[The Weeknd & French Montana:]  
Ooh, he do it better, that's a lie (that's a lie, yeah)  
He at my level, that's a lie (that's a lie, yeah)  
A hundred thousand for the times, yeah  
They fuckin' with us, that's a lie, ooh, yeah  
A lie, a lie, a lie, a lie (that's a lie)  
A lie, a lie, a lie, a lie (that's a lie)  
A lie, a lie, a lie, a lie (that's a lie)  
A lie, a lie, a lie, a lie (that's a lie)  
A lie, a lie, a lie, a lie (that's a lie)  
A lie, a lie, a lie, a lie (skrrt, skrrt)  
All of my homies gonna shine (gonna shine)  
You fuckin' with us, that's a lie (yeah)  
It's true, though (it's true, though)  
It, it's true, though (it's true, though)  
I hope the box don't spread like the rumors  
Sad, but it's true, though (it's true, though)  
It's true, though (it's true, though)  
We was bite down, now we true'd up (a lie)  
She, she say the baby mine's, that's a lie (that's a lie)  
If I ain't the hottest in the city, that's a lie (that's a lie)  
School, teach you how to read the lines (read the lines)  
In these streets, gotta read between the lines  
Room, room full of ether clouds, you don't want no smoke  
'Fore, 'fore I choke, baby, I'ma choke 'em from their choker (yeah)  
Only the red in my eyes see where you come from  
We, we the gang, either you run with or run from  
I, I'm the head, rockin' bet it's re-up in the sock  
Me and Max hit the block like Karl Malone, Stockton  
And if I ain't the new Chapo, that's a lie (that's a lie)  
And if he try and tell you we gon' stop, that's a lie  
Ooh, he do it better, that's a lie (that's a lie, yeah)  
He at my level, that's a lie (that's a lie, yeah)  
A hundred thousand for the times, yeah  
They fuckin' with us, that's a lie, ooh, yeah  
A lie, a lie, a lie, a lie  
A lie, a lie, a lie, a lie  
All of my homies gonna shine (gonna shine)  
You fuckin' with us, that's a lie (yeah)  
[Max B:]  
I got in a little too, baby, so come and play  
Daddy'll pay the cab, maybe stay for a day  
Knowin' I gotta make  
Bitches, they call me whore, son, more buns  
Mami bent over for hum  
Give her, what she want and let her get it good  
Put it on her tongue  
Told me, "Tell me, boy, you gotta get  
Fix me with a lot of dick  
Hit me with a lot of kick  
Show me you the man"  
Bustin' quickies and dippin'  
That be somethin' I can't stand  
Other plans, baby, had of late  
Tried to put me in a twirl like the Cheerio  
I ain't talkin' cereal  
Put me in a video, I can make a wave  
Baby girl, comin' home and you can't stay, out  
[The Weeknd & French Montana:]  
Ooh, he do it better, that's a lie (that's a lie, yeah)  
He at my level, that's a lie (that's a lie, yeah)  
A hundred thousand for the times, yeah  
They fuckin' with us, that's a lie, ooh, yeah  
A lie, a lie, a lie, a lie (that's a lie)  
A lie, a lie, a lie, a lie (that's a lie)  
A lie, a lie, a lie, a lie (that's a lie)  
A lie, a lie, a lie, a lie (that's a lie)  
A lie, a lie, a lie, a lie (that's a lie)  
A lie, a lie, a lie, a lie (skrrt, skrrt)  
All of my homies gonna shine (gonna shine)  
You fuckin' with us, that's a lie (yeah)
