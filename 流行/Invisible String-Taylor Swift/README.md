### Invisible String歌词：

Green was the color of the grass  
Where I used to read at Centennial Park  
I used to think I would meet somebody there  
Teal was the color of your shirt when you were 16 at the yogurt shop  
You used to work at to make a little money  
Time curious time  
Gave me no compasses  
Gave me no signs  
Were there clues I didn't see  
And isn't it just so pretty to think  
All along there was some  
Invisible string  
Tying you to me  
Bad was the blood of the song  
In the cab on your first trip to LA  
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner  
Bold was the waitress on our three year trip getting lunch down by the Lakes  
She said I looked like an American singer  
Time mystical time  
Cutting me open then healing me fine  
Were there clues I didn't see  
And isn't it just so pretty to think  
All along there was some Invisible string  
Tying you to me  
String that pulled me out of all the wrong arms right into that dive bar  
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire  
Chains around my demons  
Wool to brave the seasons  
One single thread of gold tied me to you  
Cold was the steel of my axe to grind  
For the boys who broke my heart  
Now I send their babies presents  
Gold was the color of the leaves  
When I showed you around Centennial Park  
Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven  
Time wondrous time  
Gave me the blues and then purple pink skies  
And it's cool  
Baby with me  
And isn't it just so pretty to think  
All along there was some Invisible string  
Tying you to me
