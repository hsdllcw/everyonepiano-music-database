### Cover Me in Sunshine歌词：

P!nk：  
I've been dreaming of friendly faces  
I got so much time to kill  
Just imagine people laughing  
I know some day we will  
And even if it's far away  
Give me through another day  
P!nk/Willow Sage Hart：  
Cover me in sunshine  
Shower me with good times  
Tell me that the world's been spinning since the beginning  
And everything will be alright  
Cover me in sunshine  
P!nk：  
From a distance all these mountains  
Are just some tiny hills  
Wildflowers they keep living  
While they're just standing still  
I've been missing yesterday  
But what if there's a better place  
P!nk/Willow Sage Hart：  
Cover me in sunshine  
Shower me with good times  
Tell me that the world's been spinning since the beginning  
And everything will be alright  
Cover me in sunshine  
Shower me with good times  
Tell me that the world's been spinning since the beginning  
And everything will be alright  
Cover me in sunshine  
P!nk：  
La la la la  
La la la la  
Willow Sage Hart：  
Cover me in sunshine  
Shower me with good times  
Tell me that the world's been spinning since the beginning  
And everything will be alright  
Cover me in sunshine
