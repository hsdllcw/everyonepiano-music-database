### Fake Plastic Trees歌词：

Her Green plastic watering can  
For her fake chinese rubber plant  
In fake plastic earth.

That she bought from a rubber man  
In a town full of rubber plants  
Just to get rid of itself.  
And It Wears Her Out, it wears her out  
It wears her out, it wears her out.

She lives with a broken man  
A cracked polystyrene man  
Who just crumbles and burns.

He used to do surgery  
For girls in the eighties  
But gravity always wins.  
And It Wears Him Out, it wears him out  
It wears him out, it wears him out.  
She looks like the real thing  
She tastes like the real thing  
My Fake Plastic Love.

But I can't help the feeling  
I could blow through the ceiling  
If I just turn and run  
And It Wears Me Out, it wears me out  
It wears me out, it wears me out.  
And if I could BE who you wanted  
If I could BE who you wanted,  
All the time, all the time, oh
