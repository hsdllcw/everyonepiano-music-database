**Devil In Me双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Devil In Me_ 是美国创作型歌手Halsey的歌曲，收录在其专辑Hopeless Fountain Kingdom中。

Halsey被形容为“声音有毒”，其声音可以与女歌手Lorde和埃利•古尔丁媲美。除了与生俱来的声音，Halsey的造型也一向前卫，剪了一头短发的她，外表神似澳大利亚艺人鲁比•洛斯，两人皆拥有魔鬼般的身材及多处刺青，展露酷帅与性感兼具的“男女通杀”叛逆样貌。Halsey有着大中小提琴的音乐功底及创作才华，是音乐界一股不容忽视的力量。

### Devil In Me歌词：

You said I  
Would've hit the ceiling  
You said I  
You said I  
Should eat my feelings  
Head held high  
I won't take anyone down if I crawl tonight  
But I still let everyone down when I change in size  
And I went tumbling down trying to reach your height  
But I scream too loud if I speak my mind  
I don't wanna wake it up  
I don't wanna wake it up  
I don't wanna wake it up  
The devil in me  
I don't wanna wake it up  
I don't wanna wake it up  
I don't wanna wake it up  
The devil in me  
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up  
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up  
Gotta wake up, come back to life  
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up  
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up  
Gotta wake up, come back to life  
You said I'm  
Too much to handle  
You said I  
Shine too bright  
I burnt the candle  
Flew too high  
I won't take anyone down if I crawl tonight  
But I still let everyone down when I change in size  
And I went tumbling down trying to reach your height  
But I scream too loud when I speak my mind  
I don't wanna wake it up  
I don't wanna wake it up  
I don't wanna wake it up  
The devil in me  
I don't wanna wake it up  
I don't wanna wake it up  
I don't wanna wake it up  
The devil in me  
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up  
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up  
Gotta wake up, come back to life  
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up  
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up  
Gotta wake up, come back to life  
Now I gotta wake it up  
Now I gotta wake it up  
Now I gotta wake it up  
The devil in me  
Now I gotta wake it up  
Now I gotta wake it up  
Now I gotta wake it up  
The devil in me  
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up  
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up  
Gotta wake up, come back to life  
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up  
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up  
Gotta wake up, come back to life
