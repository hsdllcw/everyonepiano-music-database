### sugar歌词：

She got cherry lips, angel eyes  
She knows exactly how to tantalize  
She's out to get u, danger by design  
Cold blooded vixen, she don't compromise  
She's optimistic of the coded lights  
So far from typical, but take my advice  
Befo' ya play with fire, do things twice  
And if ya get burned, don't be surprised  
Got me trippin' higher than the ceilin'  
Oh baby, it's the ultimate feelin'  
Ya got me lifted feelin' so gifted  
Sugar how ya get so fly  
Sugar how ya get so fly  
Sugar how ya get so fly  
Sugar how ya get so fly  
Sugar how ya get so fly  
We're talkin' lady, luv how you in tight  
Sugar we're just a rider, man spies  
Sean Penn a lil bit ethic, one's desire  
She's out to get you, you can't burn, you can't hide  
She's optimistic of the coded lights  
So far from typical, but take my advice  
Befo' ya play with fire, do things twice  
And if you get burned, don't be surprised  
Sugar how you get so fly  
Sugar how you get so fly  
Sugar how you get so fly  
But you won't get me tonight
