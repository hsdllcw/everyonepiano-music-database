### Phobia歌词：

I love the night but not the stars  
The fame suckers in their block long cars  
I f**king hate the internet  
Five star hotel and I don't feel well  
I lost a night or maybe two  
I think I'll cancel the honeymoon  
I f**king hate the internet  
Five star hotel I don't feel well  
And I could use some healing soon  
Before I lose all feeling soon  
It may be rage or maybe hope  
I'm at the stage that I fear the most  
I wanna know your phobia  
Go on press send and we can make friends  
I crossed a line a life ago  
I might be dead but I just don't know  
I'm shutting down the internet  
Big shot hotel I don't feel well  
And I could use some healing soon  
Before I lose all feeling soon  
I got some pills but not some help  
From love junkies in their private hell  
I wanna know euphoria  
Greenlight red wine and I don't feel fine  
I lost a life a line ago  
You might be here but I just don't know  
This used to be the internet  
Fat cat hotel I don't feel well  
And I could use some healing soon  
Before I lose all feeling soon  
Whoa I get the rage so live in hope  
I'm on a stage and I just can't cope  
You'll see this on the internet  
Go on press like and make my clicks spike  
I lost the plot or maybe two  
Remind me who the f**k are you  
Why don't we hit the minibar  
Five star hotel I don't feel well  
And I could use some healing soon  
Before I lose all feeling soon
