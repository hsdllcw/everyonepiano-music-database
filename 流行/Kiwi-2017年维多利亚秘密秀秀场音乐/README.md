### Kiwi歌词：

She worked her way through a cheap pack of cigarettes  
Hard liquor mixed with a bit of intellect  
And all the boys they were saying they were into it  
Such a pretty face on a pretty neck  
Driving me crazy but I'm into it but I'm into it  
I'm kind of into it  
It's getting crazy I think I'm losing it I think I'm losing it  
I think she said I'm having your baby it's none of your business  
I'm having your baby it's none of your business  
I'm having your baby it's none of your business  
I'm having your baby it's none of your it's none of your  
It's New York baby always jacked up  
Whole tunnels foreign noses always backed up  
When she's alone she goes home to a cactus  
In a black dress she's such a such an actress  
Driving me crazy but I'm into it but I'm into it  
I'm kind of into it  
It's getting crazy I think I'm losing it I think I'm losing it  
I think she said I'm having your baby it's none of your business  
I'm having your baby it's none of your business  
It's none of your  
It's none of your  
I'm having your baby it's none of your business  
I'm having your baby it's none of your it's none of your  
She sits beside me like a silhouette  
Hard candy dripping on me 'til my feet are wet  
And now she's all over me it's like I paid for it  
It's like I paid for it I'm gonna pay for this  
It's none of your it's none of your  
I'm having your baby it's none of your business  
I'm having your baby it's none of your business  
It's none of your  
It's none of your  
I'm having your baby it's none of your business  
I'm having your baby it's none of your business  
It's none of your  
It's none of your
