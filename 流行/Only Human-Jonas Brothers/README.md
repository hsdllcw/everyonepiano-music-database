### Only Human歌词：

Nick Jonas：  
Yeah ayy  
Joe Jonas：  
I don't want this night to end  
It's closing time so leave with me again  
Yeah  
You got all my love to spend oh  
Let's find a place where happiness begins  
Joe Jonas：  
We gon' dance in my living room slave to the way you move  
Hurts when I'm leaving you  
Ayy  
Just dance in the living room love with an attitude  
Drunk to an 80s groove  
Ayy  
We gon' dance in my living room slave to the way you move  
Hurts when I'm leaving you  
Ayy  
Dance in the living room love with an attitude  
Drunk  
Nick Jonas：  
It's only human you know that it's real  
So why would you fight or try to deny the way that you feel  
Oh babe you can't fool me your body's got other plans  
So stop pretending you're shy just come on and  
Dance dance dance dance oh  
Joe Jonas：  
Early morning la-la-light  
Only getting up to close the blinds oh  
I'm praying you don't change your mind  
'Cause leaving now just don't feel right  
Let's do it one more time oh babe  
Joe Jonas：  
We gon' dance in my living room slave to the way you move  
Hurts when I'm leaving you  
Hurts when I'm leaving you  
Just dance in the living room love with an attitude  
Drunk to an 80s groove  
Ayy  
We gon' dance in my living room slave to the way you move  
Hurts when I'm leaving you  
Ayy  
Dance in the living room love with an attitude  
Drunk  
Nick Jonas/Joe Jonas：  
It's only human you know that it's real  
Know that it's real  
So why would you fight or try to deny the way that you feel  
The way that you feel  
Oh babe you can't fool me your body's got other plans  
So stop pretending you're shy just come on and  
Dance dance dance dance oh  
Joe Jonas/Nick Jonas：  
Dance oh  
Woo ayy  
Only human  
It's only -man  
It's only -man  
Only human  
Oh yeah yeah yeah

It's only -man  
Only human
