### Feel Me歌词：

No one love you like I love ya  
Never cheat never lie  
Never put no one above ya  
I gave you space and time  
And now you're telling me you miss it  
And I'm still on your mind  
We were one in a million  
And love is hard to find  
Do you stay up late just so you don't dream  
Every time your lips touch another  
I want you to feel me  
I want you to feel me  
Every time you dance with somebody  
I want you to feel me  
I want you to feel me  
Do your days get a little bit longer  
Nights get a little bit colder  
Heartbeat a little bit louder  
Hah ah ah ah oh  
Days get a little bit longer  
Nights get a little bit colder  
Heartbeat a little bit louder  
Hah ah ah ah oh  
When you're running who you run to  
Where do you go to hide  
When she ain't giving you enough to get you through the night  
Won't be caught up in the middle  
Through your highs and your lows  
Baby long as you're not with me you'll always be alone  
Do you stay up late just so you don't dream  
Every time your lips touch another  
I want you to feel me  
I want you to feel me  
Every time you dance with somebody  
I want you to feel me  
I want you to feel me  
Do your days get a little bit longer  
Nights get a little bit colder  
Heartbeat a little bit louder  
Hah ah ah ah oh  
Days get a little bit longer  
Nights get a little bit colder  
Heartbeat a little bit louder  
Hah ah ah ah oh  
Feel me feel me  
Feel me feel me  
Feel me feel me  
Every time your lips touch another  
I want you to feel me  
I want you to feel me  
Every time you dance with somebody  
I want you to feel me  
I want you to feel me  
Do your days get a little bit longer  
Nights get a little bit colder  
Heartbeat a little bit louder  
Hah ah ah ah oh  
Days get a little bit longer  
Nights get a little bit colder  
Heartbeat a little bit louder  
Hah ah ah ah oh  
Every time your lips touch another  
Hah ah ah ah oh  
Every time you dance with somebody
