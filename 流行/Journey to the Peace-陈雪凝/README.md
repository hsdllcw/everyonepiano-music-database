### Journey to the Peace歌词：

I ask the star where my answer would be  
It says  
In the ocean  
I lost my star the answer's for sure  
It says look for me in the ocean  
I'd better not get lost in the foreign place  
Somebody rescue me from the foreign place  
I'd better not get lost in the pouring rain  
You'd better rescue me from the pouring rain  
Time will change but you won't change for me  
You won't change for me  
Will you change for me  
I am on my journey to the peace  
Journey to the peace  
Will I reach my peace  
I ask the star where my answer would be  
It says  
In the ocean  
I lost my star the answer's for sure  
It says look for me in the ocean  
In the ocean  
Woooooooooo  
Time will change but you won't change for me  
You won't change for me  
Will you change for me  
I am on my journey to the peace  
Journey to the peace  
Will I reach my peace  
Thousand times u showed up in my dream  
Showed up in my dream  
Can I live the dream  
I am on my journey to the peace  
Journey to the peace  
Will I reach the peace  
I ask the star where my answer would be  
It says  
In the ocean  
I lost my star the answer's for sure  
It says look for me in the ocean  
In the ocean
