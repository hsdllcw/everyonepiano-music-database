### Human歌词：

Maybe I'm foolish, maybe I'm blind  
Thinking I can see through this and see what's behind  
Got no way to prove it so maybe I'm blind

But I'm only human after all, I'm only human after all  
Don't put your blame on me  
Take a look in the mirror and what do you see  
Do you see it clearer or are you deceived in what you believe

Cos I'm only human after all, you're only human after all  
Don't put the blame on me  
Don't put your blame on me

Some people got the real problems  
Some people out of luck  
Some people think I can solve them  
Lord heavens above  
I'm only human after all, I'm only human after all  
Don't put the blame on me  
Don't put the blame on me

Don't ask my opinion, don't ask me to lie  
Then beg for forgiveness for making you cry, making you cry

Cos I'm only human after all, I'm only human after all  
Don't put your blame on me, don't put the blame on me

Some people got the real problems  
Some people out of luck  
Some people think I can solve them  
Lord heavens above  
I'm only human after all, I'm only human after all  
Don't put the blame on me  
Don't put the blame on me  
I'm only human I make mistakes  
I'm only human that's all it takes to put the blame on me  
Don't put your blame on me

I'm no prophet or messiah  
Should go looking somewhere higher

I'm only human after all, I'm only human after all  
Don't put the blame on me, don't put the blame on me  
I'm only human I do what I can  
I'm just a man, I do what I can  
Don't put the blame on me  
Don't put your blame on me
