### Welcome to My Life歌词：

Every dream in my head  
It's like a mountain that I just keep climbing  
And when I get to the edge  
I turn around and put that dream behind me  
And it never feels the way I want  
But I keep on tryin'  
I just keep on tryin'  
Have you been there?  
Have you seen it all?  
Have you done this once before?  
Did they tell you, you'll love this life and all these lights?  
Now you're lying on the floor  
And they know, what doesn't kill you makes you want it more  
And this is your life  
Your life, your life  
Ow! Welcome to my  
[Cal Scruby:]  
Hello, this is my life in your TV  
I overdose in that night life, them bright lights and bikinis  
I keep my hand on that gold bottle, I'm tryna find me that genie  
They say money doesn't buy happiness, but I'd rather cry in that  
Lamborghini  
Damn, I don't know who I am  
I just know who I wanna be  
No looking back, everything is in front of me  
I never act like they puttin' a gun to me  
I ain't stuck up, same motherfucker that I've always been  
You must've got me fucked up, because I ain't tryna get that all white Benz  
Never that though  
Been on my job, sayin' I'm different now  
Say I don't listen now  
I don't got time to pick up the phone to hear what you bitching 'bout  
I'm on a mission, feel like I'm missin' now  
Bitch you ain't in my position now  
You never walked a mile in my shoes  
I'm feeling so distant now  
[Chris Brown:]  
Have you been there?  
Have you seen it all?  
Have you done this once before?  
Did they tell you, you'll love this life and all these lights?  
Now you're lying on the floor  
And they know, what doesn't kill you makes you want it more  
And this is your life  
Your life, your life  
Welcome to my life  
[Cal Scruby:]  
I've been thinkin' too much, I wonder if I did that right  
I've been drinkin' too much, I don't know what I did last night  
Tried talk to myself like, you don't really wanna live that life  
I wanted it all to myself like, you don't wanna give that life, away  
But I gotta leave, I can't stay  
Part of me say "Keep going", that other hand say "Quit playing"  
Gotta keep prayin' (prayin')  
Even when I got it all, all these broads and alcohol  
Livin' on the edge, I'm bound to fall (fall)  
But I stay movin', stay climbin' (climbin')  
Puttin' in work, I stay grindin' (grindin')  
Lookin' for the answer, can't find it (can't find it)  
That's the truth, I can't hide it (hide it)  
Now or never forever, that's how I'm livin' my life  
It's hard to plan for tomorrow, when you just live for the night  
[Chris Brown:]  
Every dream in my head  
It's like a mountain that I just keep climbing  
And when I get to the edge  
I turn around and put that dream behind me  
And it never feels the way I want  
But I keep on tryin'  
I just keep on tryin'  
Have you been there?  
Have you seen it all?  
Have you done this once before?  
Did they tell you, you'll love this life and all these lights?  
Now you're lying on the floor  
And they know, what doesn't kill you makes you want it more  
And this is your life  
Your life, your life
