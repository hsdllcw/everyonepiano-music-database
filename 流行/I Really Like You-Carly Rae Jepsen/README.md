### I Really Like You歌词：

I really wanna stop  
But I just gotta taste for it  
I feel like I could fly with the ball on the moon  
So honey hold my hand you like making me wait for it  
I feel I could die walking up to the room, oh yeah

Late night watching television  
But how we get in this position?  
It's way too soon, I know this isn't love  
But I need to tell you something

I really really really really really really like you  
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?  
I really really really really really really like you  
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?

Oh, did I say too much?  
I'm so in my head  
When we're out of touch  
I really really really really really really like you  
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?

It's like everything you say is a sweet revelation  
All I wanna do is get into your head  
Yeah we could stay alone, you and me, and this temptation  
Sipping on your lips, hanging on by thread, baby

Late night watching television  
But how we get in this position?  
It's way too soon, I know this isn't love  
But I need to tell you something

I really really really really really really like you  
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?  
I really really really really really really like you  
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?

Oh, did I say too much?  
I'm so in my head  
When we're out of touch  
I really really really really really really like you  
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?

Who gave you eyes like that?  
Said you could keep them  
I don't know how to act  
The way I should be leaving  
I'm running out of time  
Going out of my mind  
I need to tell you something  
Yeah, I need to tell you something

I really really really really really really like you  
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?  
I really really really really really really like you  
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?

Oh, did I say too much?  
I'm so in my head  
When we're out of touch  
I really really really really really really like you  
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?

I really really really really really really like you  
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?  
I really really really really really really like you  
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?
