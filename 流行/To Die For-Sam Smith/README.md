### To Die For歌词：

It is if everyone dies alone  
Does that scare you  
I don't wanna be alone  
I look for you  
Every day every night  
I close my eyes  
From the fear from the light  
As I wander down the avenue so confused  
Guess I'll try and force a smile  
Pink lemonade sippin' on a Sunday  
Couples holding hands on a runway  
They're all posing in a picture frame  
Whilst my world's crashing down  
Solo shadow on a sidewalk  
Just want somebody to die for  
Sunshine livin' on a perfect day  
While my world's crashing down  
I just want somebody to die for  
I long for you  
Just a touch  
Does that scare you  
Of your hand  
You don't leave my mind  
Lonely days I'm feeling  
Like a fool for dreaming  
As I wander down the avenue so confused  
Guess I'll try to force a smile  
Pink lemonade sippin' on a Sunday  
Couples holding hands on a runway  
They're all posing in a picture frame  
Whilst my world's crashing down  
Solo shadow on a sidewalk  
Just want somebody to die for  
Sunshine livin' on a perfect day  
While my world's crashing down  
I just want somebody to die for  
I just want somebody to die for  
To die for  
I just want somebody to die for  
Does that scare you  
I don't wanna be alone  
Pink lemonade sippin' on a Sunday  
Couples holding hands on a runway  
Oh  
They're all posing in a picture frame  
Whilst my world's crashing down  
Solo shadow on a sidewalk  
Just want somebody to die for  
Sunshine livin' on a perfect day  
While my world's crashing down  
I just want somebody to die for  
I just want somebody to die for  
To die for
