_Lights Up_ 是英国男歌手Harry
Styles演唱的歌曲。此曲一改大气复古的风格，由摇滚转为更加轻盈的方向。作为前演唱团体单向组合成员，Harry
Styles在音乐方面的表现并不突出。但自从转向个人后，他完全可以达成看似不可能的任务。R&B、EDM、说唱甚至是民谣等等乐风，他都有可能尝试，并且完全能够像模像样。

### Lights Up歌词：

What do you mean  
I'm sorry by the way  
I'm never coming back down  
Can't you see  
I could but wouldn't stay  
I wouldn't put it like that  
What do you mean  
I'm sorry by the way  
I'm never coming around  
It'd be so sweet if things just stayed the same  
La da da da dah  
All the lights couldn't put out the dark  
Running through my heart  
Lights up and they know who you are  
Know who you are  
Do you know who you are  
Shine  
Step into the light  
It's so bright sometimes  
Shine  
I'm not ever going back  
Shine  
Step into the light  
Shine  
It's so bright sometimes  
Shine  
I'm not ever going back  
Shine  
Step into the light  
Shine  
It's so bright sometimes  
Shine  
I'm not ever  
What do you mean  
I'm sorry by the way  
I'm never going back now  
It'd be so sweet if things just stayed the same  
La da da da dah  
La da da da dah  
La da da da dah  
La da da da dah  
La da da da dah  
All the lights couldn't put out the dark  
Running through my heart  
Lights up and they know who you are  
Know who you are  
Do you know who you are
