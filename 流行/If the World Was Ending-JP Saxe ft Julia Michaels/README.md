### If the World Was Ending歌词：

I was distracted and in traffic  
I didn't feel it when the earthquake happened  
But it really got me thinkin' were you out drinkin'  
Were you in the living room chillin' watchin' television  
It's been a year now think I've figured out how  
How to let you go and let communication die out  
I know you know we know you weren't  
Down for forever and it's fine  
I know you know we know we weren't  
Meant for each other and it's fine  
But if the world was ending you'd come over right  
You'd come over and you'd stay the night  
Would you love me for the hell of it  
All our fears would be irrelevant  
If the world was ending you'd come over right  
The sky'd be falling and I'd hold you tight  
And there wouldn't be a reason why  
We would even have to say goodbye  
If the world was ending you'd come over right right  
If the world was ending you'd come over right right  
I tried to imagine your reaction  
It didn't scare me when the earthquake happened  
But it really got me thinkin' the night we went drinkin'  
Stumbled in the house and didn't make it past the kitchen  
Ah it's been a year now think I've figured out how  
How to think about you without it rippin' my heart out  
And I know you know we know you weren't  
Down for forever and it's fine  
I know you know we know we weren't  
Meant for each other and it's fine  
But if the world was ending you'd come over right  
You'd come over and you'd stay the night  
Would you love me for the hell of it  
All our fears would be irrelevant  
If the world was ending you'd come over right  
Sky'd be falling while I hold you tight  
No there wouldn't be a reason why  
We would even have to say goodbye  
If the world was ending you'd come over right  
You'd come over right  
You'd come over you'd come over you'd come over right  
I know you know we know you weren't  
Down for forever and it's fine  
I know you know we know we weren't  
Meant for each other and it's fine  
But if the world was ending you'd come over right  
You'd come over and you'd stay the night  
Would you love me for the hell of it  
All our fears would be irrelevant  
If the world was ending you'd come over right  
The sky'd be falling while I hold you tight  
No there wouldn't be a reason why  
We would even have to say goodbye  
If the world was ending you'd come over right  
You'd come over you'd come over you'd come over right  
Hmm  
If the world was ending you'd come over right
