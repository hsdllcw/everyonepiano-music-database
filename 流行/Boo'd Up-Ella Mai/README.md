### Boo'd Up歌词：

Feelings so deep in my feelings  
Notice they ain't really like me  
Can't control my anxiety  
Feeling like I'm touching the ceiling  
When I'm with you I can't breathe  
Boy you do something to me  
Ooh don't ever get over you until I find something new  
That get me high like you do  
Ooh don't ever get over you until I find something new  
That get me high like you do  
Listen my to heart go badum boo'd up  
Biddy da dum boo'd up  
Hear my heart go badum boo'd up  
Biddy da dum it just won't stop it go  
Badum boo'd up  
Biddy da dum boo'd up  
Hear my heart go badum boo'd up  
Biddy da dum it just won't stop it go  
How many ways can I say that I need you baby it's true  
I think I might die without you  
Feeling all over my body  
You know how I like it  
Ain't gotta tell you what to do  
Ooh don't ever get over you until I find something new  
That get me high like you do  
Ooh don't ever get over you until I find something new  
That get me high like you do  
Listen my to heart go badum boo'd up  
Biddy da dum boo'd up  
Hear my heart go badum boo'd up  
Biddy da dum it just won't stop it go  
Badum boo'd up  
Biddy da dum boo'd up  
Hear my heart go badum boo'd up  
Biddy da dum it just won't stop it go  
Head over heels in love  
Riding funny I ain't gotta look no more baby hah  
I wanna build this love  
And everything you want you ain't gotta ask for  
You got me boo'd up boo'd up  
Boo'd up boo'd up  
Told you from the jump I'm the one that you took  
Got me boo'd up boo'd up  
Boo'd up boo'd up  
Grab me by the waist baby pull me closer  
Ooh don't ever get over you until I find something new  
That get me high like you do  
Ooh don't ever get over you until I find something new  
That get me high like you do  
Listen my to heart go badum boo'd up  
Biddy da dum boo'd up  
Hear my heart go badum boo'd up  
Biddy da dum it just won't stop it go  
Badum boo'd up  
Biddy da dum boo'd up  
Hear my heart go badum boo'd up  
Biddy da dum it just won't stop it go  
This is such a crazy feeling though  
I don't want to get too attached but I feel like I already am  
My mind's telling me one thing but  
I guess I should listen to my heart
