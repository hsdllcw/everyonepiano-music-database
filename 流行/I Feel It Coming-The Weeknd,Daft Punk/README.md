### I Feel It Coming歌词：

Tell me what you really like  
Baby I can take my time  
We don't ever have to fight  
Just take it step by step  
I can see it in your eyes  
Cause they never tell me lies  
I can feel that body shake  
And the heat between your legs  
You've been scared of love  
And what it did to you  
You don't have to run  
I know what you've been through  
Just a simple touch  
And it can set you free  
We don't have to rush  
When you're alone with me  
I feel it coming  
I feel it coming babe  
I feel it coming  
I feel it coming babe  
I feel it coming  
I feel it coming babe  
I feel it coming  
I feel it coming babe  
You are not the single type  
So baby this the perfect time  
I'm just trying to get you high  
And faded off this touch  
You don't need a lonely night  
So baby I can make it right  
You just got to let me try  
To give you what you want  
You've been scared of love  
And what it did to you  
You don't have to run  
I know what you've been through  
Just a simple touch  
And it can set you free  
We don't have to rush  
When you're alone with me  
I feel it coming  
I feel it coming babe  
I feel it coming  
I feel it coming babe  
I feel it coming  
I feel it coming babe  
I feel it coming  
I feel it coming babe  
I feel it coming  
I feel it coming  
I feel it coming babe  
I feel it coming  
I feel it coming babe  
I feel it coming  
I feel it coming babe  
You've been scared of love  
And what it did to you  
You don't have to run  
I know what you've been through  
Just a simple touch  
And it can set you free  
We don't have to rush  
When you're alone with me  
I feel it coming  
I feel it coming babe  
I feel it coming  
I feel it coming babe  
I feel it coming  
I feel it coming babe  
I feel it coming  
I feel it coming babe  
I feel it coming  
I feel it coming babe  
I feel it coming  
I feel it coming babe  
I feel it coming  
I feel it coming babe  
I feel it coming  
I feel it coming babe  
I feel it coming babe  
I feel it coming babe  
I feel it coming babe
