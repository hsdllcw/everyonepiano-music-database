### Next to Me歌词：

Something about the way that you walked into my living room  
Casually and confident lookin' at the mess I am  
But still you still you want me  
Stress lines and cigarettes politics and deficits  
Late bills and overages screamin' and hollerin'  
But still you still you want me  
Oh I always let you down  
You're shattered on the ground  
But still I find you there  
Next to me  
And oh stupid things I do  
I'm far from good it's true  
But still I find you  
Next to me  
There's something about the way that you always see the pretty view  
Overlook the blooded mess always lookin' effortless  
And still you still you want me  
I got no innocence faith ain't no privilege  
I am a deck of cards vice or a game of hearts  
And still you still you want me  
Oh I always let you down  
You're shattered on the ground  
But still I find you there  
Next to me  
And oh stupid things I do  
I'm far from good it's true  
But still I find you  
Next to me  
So thank you for taking a chance on me  
I know it isn't easy  
But I hope to be worth it  
Oh  
So thank you for taking a chance on me  
I know it isn't easy  
But I hope to be worth it  
Oh  
Oh I always let you down  
I always let you down  
You're shattered on the ground  
Shattered on the ground  
But still I find you there  
Yeah  
Next to me  
And oh stupid things I do  
Stupid things I do  
I'm far from good it's true  
But still I find you  
Next to me  
Next to me
