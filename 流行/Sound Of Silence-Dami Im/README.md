### Sound of Silence歌词:

[Verse 1]  
Growing tired and weary, brown eyes  
Tryna feel your love through Facetime  
Symphonies of dreams and highlights  
Caught up in this crazy fast life  
But baby you're not here with me

[Pre-Chorus]  
And I keep calling, calling  
Keep calling cause

[Chorus]  
Now my heart awakes to the sound of silence  
And it beats to the sound of silence  
And it beats to the sound of silence  
Now my heart awakes to the sound of silence  
And it beats to the sound of silence  
And it beats to the sound of silence

[Verse 2]  
Getting hard to break through the madness  
You're not here, it never makes sense  
Tidal waves of tears are crashin'  
No one here to save me drownin'  
Cause baby you're not here with me

[Pre-Chorus]  
And I keep calling, calling  
Keep calling cause

[Chorus]  
Now my heart awakes to the sound of silence  
And it beats to the sound of silence  
And it beats to the sound of silence  
Now my heart awakes to the sound of silence  
And it beats to the sound of silence  
And it beats to the sound of silence

[Bridge]  
I know I'm stronger and I'm capable  
I know it's all in my head  
But I keep calling, calling  
Calling, calling

[Chorus]  
Now my heart awakes to the sound of silence  
And it beats to the sound of silence  
And it beats to the sound of silence  
Now my heart awakes to the sound of silence  
And it beats to the sound of silence  
And it beats to the sound of silence  
Silence, silence
