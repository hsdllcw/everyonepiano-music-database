### Before You Go歌词：

I fell by the wayside like everyone else  
I hate you I hate you  
I hate you but I was just kidding myself  
Our every moment I start to replace  
'Cause now that they're gone  
All I hear are the words that I needed to say  
When you hurt under the surface  
Like troubled water running cold  
Well time can heal but this won't  
So before you go  
Was there something I could've said  
To make your heart beat better  
If only I'd've known you had a storm to weather  
So before you go  
Was there something I could've said  
To make it all stop hurting  
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless  
So before you go  
Was never the right time whenever you called  
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all  
Our every moment I start to replay it  
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face  
When you hurt under the surface  
Like troubled water running cold  
Well time can heal but this won't  
So before you go  
Was there something I could've said  
To make your heart beat better  
If only I'd've known you had a storm to weather  
So before you go  
Was there something I could've said  
To make it all stop hurting  
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless  
So before you go  
Would we be better off by now  
If I'd have let my walls come down  
Maybe I guess we'll never know  
You know you know  
Before you go  
Was there something I could've said  
To make your heart beat better  
If only I'd've known you had a storm to weather  
So before you go  
Was there something I could've said  
To make it all stop hurting  
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless  
So before you go
