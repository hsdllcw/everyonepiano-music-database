### Shelter歌词：

I could never find the right way to tell you  
Have you noticed I've been gone?  
(Be)'cause I left behind the home that you made me  
But I will carry it along  
And it's a long way forward, so trust in me  
I'll give them shelter, like you've done for me  
And I know I'm not alone, you'll be watching over us  
Until you're gone  
When I'm older, I'll be silent beside you  
I know words won't be enough  
And they won't need to know the names or our faces  
But they will carry on for us  
And it's a long way forward, so trust in me  
I'll give them shelter like you've done for me  
And I know I'm not alone, you'll be watching over us  
Until you're gone  
Oh, it's a long way forward, trust in me  
I'll give them shelter like you've done for me  
And I know, I'm not alone, you'll be watching over us  
Until...
