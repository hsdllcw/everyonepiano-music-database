**Against All Odds** 是电影《似是故人来》的主题曲。

  
另外， _Against All Odds_ （如此艰难）这是作者菲尔•柯林斯（Phil
Collins）自写、自唱、自己打鼓的歌曲，在美国连续三周占据排行榜冠军。这首歌曲之所以成为情歌中的经曲，精彩的并不是它的歌词，而是它抑扬顿挫、感天动地的旋律和演唱。钢琴和吉他勾勒了演唱主线的粗线条，而键琴则铺垫了厚重而深沉的氛围，尤其在歌曲结束处，菲尔•柯林斯缠绵执著的演唱，伴随着有力的鼓点，实在让人动容。

### Against All Odds歌词：

How can I just let you walk away, just let you leave without a trace  
When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh  
You're the only one who really knew me at all

How can you just walk away from me,  
when all I can do is watch you leave  
Cos we've shared the laughter and the pain and even shared the tears  
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now, oh there's just an empty space  
And there's nothing left here to remind me,  
just the memory of your face  
Ooh take a look at me now, well there's just an empty space  
And you coming back to me is against all odds and that's what I've got to face

I wish I could just make you turn around,  
turn around and see me cry  
There's so much I need to say to you,  
so many reasons why  
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now, well there's just an empty space  
And there's nothing left here to remind me, just the memory of your face  
Now take a look at me now, cos there's just an empty space

But to wait for you, is all I can do and that's what I've got to face  
Take a good look at me now, cos I'll still be standing here  
And you coming back to me is against all odds  
It's the chance I've gotta take

Take a look at me now
