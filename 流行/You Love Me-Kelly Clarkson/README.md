You Love Me_ 是由美国歌手Kelly Clarkson创作演唱的一首歌曲，发行于2011年10月25日。 _You Love Me_
收录在她的第五张专辑Stronger里。
辑Stronger的灵感来源包括许多很有影响力的歌手，包括、蒂娜•特纳、电台司令乐队、雪儿•克罗和艾瑞莎•弗兰克林等，并请来曾与惠特妮•休斯顿合作的制作人Rodney
Jerkins来操刀制作。Kelly表示道：“这次专辑将会是我近年来作品最接近心灵的一次，你知道我要表达的是什么吗？就好似电台司令乐队的另类说唱尽管是非主流，但是它们依然让人产生共鸣。雪儿•克罗也是这样，她是一个非常能够渲染乐迷心灵的歌手，总会创作出一些富有韵律的流行摇滚乐。”

### You Love Me歌词：

Thick skin, soft touch,  
Heart of gold but it's na-na-na-not enough,  
Forgiving arms, the higher road,  
Working hard but it's na-na-na-not enough,  
You say, I'm not good enough, I'm not good enough  
But what you really mean is, you're not good enough, you're not good enough  
You can't deliver  
So you turn it around

You didn't let me down,  
You didn't tear me apart  
You just opened my eyes,  
While breaking my heart  
You didn't do it for me  
I'm not as dumb as you think, you just made me cry  
While claiming that you love me  
You love me, you love me  
You said you loved me but that I  
I'm not good enough, I'm not good enough

Stronghold, but fun ride,  
But roller coasters aren't just na-na-na-not enough,  
I keep it in, you wear me out,  
This kind of love is na-na-na-not enough,  
Said I'm just a sinking ship, I'm just a sinking ship,  
But what that really means, is you can't handle this, you can't handle this,  
You couldn't win so you turn it around

Your love feels different it's like a blow to the head with your compliments.  
Your love hurts deeper  
It's like a brick in the sea and I'm drowning with it

So understand it means nothing when you say you love me  
When you say you love me  
When you say you love me  
You love me, you love me

You didn't let me down,  
You didn't tear me apart  
You just opened my eyes,  
While breaking my heart  
You didn't do it for me  
I'm not as dumb as you think, you just made me cry  
While claiming that you love me  
You love me, you love me  
You know the truth is that  
You're not good enough, you're not good enough
