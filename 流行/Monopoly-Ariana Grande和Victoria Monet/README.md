### Monopoly歌词：

Ariana Grande：  
Yeah  
Victoria Monét：  
I've been on the road where you been  
Real protective with my soul where you been  
Is your GPS even on where you been  
Matter of fact I don't even care where you been  
Bad vibes get off of me  
Outta here with the f**kery  
Treat my goals like property  
Collect them like Monopoly  
I probably won't come if there's not a fee  
And if they try come stoppin' me  
I swerve both ways dichotomy  
Victoria Monét/Ariana Grande：  
I like women and men  
Yeah  
Work so f**kin' much need a twinny twin twin  
How you hit the club when you barely got in  
Then we hit the bank making them investments  
For the win oh  
Said I been on the road where you been  
Where you been  
Real protective with my soul where you been  
Where you been  
Is your GPS even on where you been  
Where you been  
Matter of fact I don't even care where you been  
Bad vibes get off of me  
Outta here with the f**kery  
Treat my goals like property  
Collect them like Monopoly  
I probably won't come if there's not a fee  
And if they try come stoppin' me  
I show them my discography  
Yeah yeah  
I like women and men  
Yeah  
Work so f**kin' much need a twinny twin twin  
Yeah  
You'd be straight for life if I gave you my PIN  
Yeah  
Even though we gave up that 90%  
For the win go  
Victoria Monét/Ariana Grande：  
I've been on the road where you been  
Where you been  
Real protective with my soul where you been  
Where you been  
Is your GPS even on where you been  
Where you been  
Matter of fact I don't even care where you been  
Yeah  
Hell no

Oh yeah
