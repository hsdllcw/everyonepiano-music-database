### Runaway歌词：

I was listening to the ocean  
I saw a face in the sand  
But when I picked it up that it vanished away  
From my hand down  
I had a dream I was 7  
Climbing my way in a tree  
I saw a piece of heaven  
Waiting impatient for me down  
And I was running far away  
Would I run off the world someday  
Nobody knows nobody knows  
And I was dancing in the rain  
I felt alive and I can't complain  
But now take me home take me home where I belong  
I can't take it anymore  
I was painting a picture  
The picture was a painting of you  
And for a moment I thought you were here  
But then again it wasn't true down  
And all this time I have been lying  
Oh lying in secret to myself  
I've been putting sorrow on the farthest place on my shelf dadida  
And I was running far away  
Would I run off the world someday  
Nobody knows nobody knows  
And I was dancing in the rain  
I felt alive and I can't complain  
But now take me home take me home where I belong  
I got no other place to go  
But now take me home take me home where I belong  
I got no other place to go  
But now take me home take me home where I belong  
I can't take it anymore  
But I kept running  
For a soft place to fall  
And I kept running  
For a soft place to fall  
And I kept running  
For a soft place to fall  
And I kept running  
For a soft place to fall  
And I was running far away  
Would I run off the world someday  
But now take me home  
Take me home where I belong I got no other place to go  
But now take me home  
Take me home where I belong  
I got no other place to go  
But now take me home  
Home where I belong  
Now now now take me home  
Home where I belong  
Home home home  
Now take me home home where I belong  
Now now now take me home  
Home where I belong  
I can't take it anymore
