**Kryptonite双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Kryptonite_ 是美国摇滚乐队3 Doors
Down的歌曲。此曲导致了比洛克西的本地广播站WCPR空前的电话点播。这使他们在故乡大受欢迎并且逐渐能够吸引大批的观众来看他们在当地的现场演唱会。这一切帮助他们把他们的名字传到了密西西比州之外，传出了偏远的南方一直传到一些国际性的著名俱乐部，像纽约的CBGB。

### Kryptonite歌词：

I took a walk around the world  
To ease my troubled mind  
I left my body lying somewhere  
In the sands of time  
But I watched the world float  
To the dark side of the moon

I feel there is nothing I can do, yeah

I watched the world float  
To the dark side of the moon  
After all I knew it had to be  
Something to do with you  
I really don’t mind what happens now and then  
As long as you’ll be my friend at the end

If I go crazy then will you still  
Call me Superman  
If I’m alive and well, will you be  
There a-holding my hand  
I’ll keep you by my side  
With my superhuman might  
Kryptonite

You called me strong, you called me weak,  
But still your secrets I will keep  
You took for granted all the times  
I never let you down  
You stumbled in and bumped your head,  
If not for me then you'd be dead  
I picked you up and put you back on solid ground

If I go crazy then will you still  
Call me Superman  
If I’m alive and well,  
Will you be there a-holding my hand  
I’ll keep you by my side  
With my superhuman might  
Kryptonite

If I go crazy then will you still  
Call me Superman  
If I’m alive and well, will you be there  
Holding my hand  
I’ll keep you by my side  
With my superhuman might  
Kryptonite  
Yeah!!

If I go crazy then will you still  
Call me Superman  
If I'm alive and well,  
Will you be there a-holding my hand  
I'll keep you by my side  
With my superhuman might  
Kryptonite

Oh, whoa, whoa  
Oh, whoa, whoa  
Oh, whoa, whoa
