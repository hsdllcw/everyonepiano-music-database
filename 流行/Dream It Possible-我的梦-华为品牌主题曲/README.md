### Dream It Possible歌词：

I will run I will climb I will soar  
I'm undefeated  
Jumping out of my skin pull the chord  
Yeah I believe it  
The past is everything we were don't make us who we are  
So I'll dream until I make it real and all I see is stars  
It's not until you fall that you fly  
When your dreams come alive you're unstoppable  
Take a shot chase the sun find the beautiful  
We will glow in the dark turning dust to gold  
And we'll dream it possible  
Possible  
I will chase I will reach I will fly  
Until I'm breaking until I'm breaking  
Out of my cage like a bird in the night  
I know I'm changing I know I'm changing  
In into something big better than before  
And if it takes takes a thousand lives  
Then it's worth fighting for  
It's not until you fall that you fly  
When your dreams come alive you're unstoppable  
Take a shot chase the sun find the beautiful  
We will glow in the dark turning dust to gold  
And we'll dream it possible possible possible possible  
From the bottom to the top  
We're sparking wild fire's  
Never quit and never stop  
The rest of our lives  
From the bottom to the top  
We're sparking wild fire's  
Never quit and never stop  
It's not until you fall that you fly  
When your dreams come alive you're unstoppable  
Take a shot chase the sun find the beautiful  
We will glow in the dark turning dust to gold  
And we'll dream it possible  
Possible possible possible  
We'll dream it possible
