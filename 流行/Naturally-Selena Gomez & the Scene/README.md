### Naturally歌词：

How you choose to express yourself  
It's all your own and I can tell  
It comes naturally, it comes naturally

You follow what you feel inside  
It's intuitive, you don't have to try  
It comes naturally, mmmm, it comes naturally

And it takes my breath away (away, away, away)  
What you do so naturally (turally, turally, turally)

[Chorus:]  
You are the thunder and I am the lightning  
And I love the way you know who you are and to me it's exciting  
When you know it's meant to be  
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally  
When you're with me, baby  
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally  
Ba-ba-baby

You have a way of moving me  
A force of nature, your energy  
It comes naturally (you know it does), it comes naturally  
Mmmm, yeah

And it takes my breath away (away, away) every time  
What you do so naturally

[Chorus]

When we collide sparks fly  
When you look in my eyes  
It takes my breath away

[Chorus]

Everything, baby, comes naturally
