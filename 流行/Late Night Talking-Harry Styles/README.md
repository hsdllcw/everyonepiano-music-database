《 **Late Night Talking** 》是英国男歌手Harry Styles演唱的歌曲，收录在其第三张录音室专辑《Harry's
House》中。

歌曲开头急促的节奏带来了一蹴而就的夏日，欢快愉悦的伴奏，略带沙哑的嗓音，熟悉亲切的声线，汇聚组合成这首五月的末梢的神曲。

这张情绪轻快、略带电子乐风格的专辑是以“家”的概念展开的。唯一稍显意外的可能是，专辑名字的灵感来源于日本流行先驱细野晴臣 70 年代的专辑《Hosono
House》（细野之家）。‘家’不是一个地理位置的概念，而是你内心的归属。

### Late Night Talking歌词：

Things haven't been quite the same  
There's a haze on the horizon babe  
It's only been a couple of days and I miss you  
Mmm yeah  
When nothing really goes to plan  
You stub your toe or break your camera  
I'll do everything I can to help you through  
If you're feeling down  
I just wanna make you happier baby  
Wish I was around  
I just wanna make you happier baby  
We've been doing all this late night talking  
About anything you want until the morning  
Now you're in my life  
I can't get you off my mind  
I've never been a fan of change  
But I'd follow you to any place  
If it's Hollywood or Bishopsgate I'm coming too  
If you're feeling down  
I just want to make you happier baby  
Wish I was around  
I just wanna make you happier baby  
We've been doing all this late night talking  
About anything you want until the morning  
Now you're in my life  
I can't get you off my mind  
Can't get you off my mind  
Can't get you off my mind  
I won't even try  
To get you off my mind  
Get you off my mind  
We've been doing all this late night talking  
About anything you want until the morning  
Now you're in my life  
I can't get you off my mind  
Can't get you off my mind  
All this late night talking  
Can't get you off my mind  
All this late night talking  
I won't even try  
All this late night talking  
Can't get you off my  
All this late night talking
