### Cardigan歌词：

Vintage tee brand new phone  
High heels on cobblestones  
When you are young they assume you know nothing  
Sequin smile black lipstick  
Sensual politics  
When you are young they assume you know nothing  
But I knew you  
Dancing in your Levi's  
Drunk under a streetlight  
I knew you  
Hand under my sweatshirt  
Baby kiss it better  
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed  
You put me on and said I was your favorite  
A friend to all is a friend to none  
Chase two girls lose the one  
When you are young they assume you know nothing  
But I knew you  
Playing hide-and-seek and  
Giving me your weekends  
I knew you  
Your heartbeat on the High Line  
Once in twenty lifetimes  
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed  
You put me on and said I was your favorite  
To kiss in cars and downtown bars  
Was all we needed  
You drew stars around my scars  
But now I'm bleeding  
Cause I knew you  
Stepping on the last train  
Marked me like a bloodstain  
I knew you  
Tried to change the ending  
Peter losing Wendy  
I knew you  
Leaving like a father  
Running like water  
When you are young they assume you know nothing  
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss  
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs  
The smell of smoke would hang around this long  
Cause I knew everything when I was young  
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time  
Chasing shadows in the grocery line  
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired  
And you'd be standing in my front porch light  
And I knew you'd come back to me  
You'd come back to me  
And you'd come back to me  
And you'd come back  
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan  
Under someone's bed  
You put me on and said I was your favorite
