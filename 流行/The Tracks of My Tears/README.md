### The Tracks of My Tears歌词：

Doo loo loo loo doo loo loo doo loo loo loo doo loo loo loo  
People say I'm the life of the party  
Because I tell a joke or two  
Although I might be laughing loud and hearty baby burm  
Deep inside I'm blue  
So take a good look at my face  
You see my smile looks out of place  
If you look closer it's easy to trace  
The tracks of my tears(Doo loo doo loo loo loo)  
I need you(Need you)  
Need you(Need you)  
Since you left me if you see me with another girl  
Seeing like I'm having fun  
Although she may be cute she's just a substitute  
Because you're the permanent one  
So take a good look at my face  
You see my smile looks out of place  
If you look closer it's easy to trace  
The tracks of my tears(Doo loo doo loo loo loo)  
I need you(Need you)  
Need you(Need you)  
Oh  
Oh hi yeah  
(Outside)I'm masquerading  
(Inside)My hope is fading  
(Just find)Oh yeah Just find you put me down  
My smile is my make up  
I wear since my break-up with you  
Baby take a good look at my face ha  
You see my smile looks out of place  
You look a little closer it's easy to trace  
The tracks of my tears(Doo loo doo loo loo loo)  
Baby baby baby take a good look (at my face)  
Oh yeah(Smile looks out of place)  
Look look big closer it's easy to trace oh  
The tracks of my tears(Doo loo doo loo loo loo)  
I need you baby  
My face being loving you(Smile looks out of place) hey oh  
Look a little big closer it's easy to trace yeah  
The tracks of my tears
