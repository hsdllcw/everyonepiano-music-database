**Fallin'** 出自 Alicia Keys《Songs in A Minor》专辑。12座葛莱美奖的超完美钢琴天后Alicia
Keys，她的音乐有着自己独有的味道，在爵士音乐风格里，加上浓厚的R&B和灵魂唱腔，甜美诱人的面孔却有着不同于年龄的及具感染力的成熟嗓音，一句传统式的灵魂唱腔清唱，收放自如的歌声踩着鼓点，澎湃真挚的情感，情绪的张力沉沦在歌声里不可自拔，唱出了蓝调的韵味。

### Fallin'歌词：

I keep on fallin  
In and out of love  
With you  
Sometimes I love ya  
Sometimes you make me blue  
Sometimes I feel good  
At times I feel used  
Lovin you darlin  
Makes me so confused  
I keep on  
Fallin'  
In and out of love with you  
I never loved someone  
The way that I love you  
Oh, oh , I've never felt this way  
How do you give me so much pleasure  
And cause me so much pain  
Just when I think  
Ive takin more than would a fool  
I start fallin' back in love with you  
I keep on  
Fallin  
In and out of love with you  
I never loved someone  
The way that I love you  
Now baby  
I I I I'm fallin'  
I I I I'm fallin'  
Fall fall fallin  
I keep on  
Fallin  
In and out of love with you  
I never loved someone  
The way that I love you  
Im fallin  
In and out of love with you  
I never loved someone  
The way that I love you  
Im fallin  
In and out of love with you  
I never loved someone  
The way that I love you  
What
