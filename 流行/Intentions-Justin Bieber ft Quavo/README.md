### Intentions歌词：

Justin Bieber：  
Picture perfect you don't need no filter  
Gorgeous make 'em drop dead you a killer  
Shower you with all my attention  
Yeah these are my only intentions  
Stay in the kitchen cookin' up got your own bread  
Heart full of equity you're an asset  
Make sure that you don't need no mentions  
Yeah these are my only intentions  
Shout out to your mom and dad for makin' you  
Standin' ovation they did a great job raising you  
Ooh when I create you're my muse  
That kind of smile that makes the news  
Can't nobody throw shade on your name in these streets  
Triple threat you a boss you a bae you a beast  
You make it easy to choose  
You got a mean touch I can't refuse  
No I can't refuse it  
Picture perfect you don't need no filter  
Gorgeous make 'em drop dead you a killer  
Shower you with all my attention  
Yeah these are my only intentions  
Stay in the kitchen cookin' up got your own bread  
Heart full of equity you're an asset  
Make sure that you don't need no mentions  
Yeah these are my only intentions  
Already pass you don't need no approval  
Good everywhere don't worry 'bout no refusal  
Second to none you got the upper hand now  
Don't need a sponsor nope you the brand now  
You're my rock my Colorado  
Get that ring just like Toronto  
Love you now a little more tomorrow  
This how I feel act like you know that you are-  
Picture perfect you don't need no filter  
Gorgeous make 'em drop dead you a killer  
Shower you with all my attention  
Yeah these are my only intentions  
Stay in the kitchen cookin' up got your own bread  
Whip it  
Heart full of equity you're an asset
