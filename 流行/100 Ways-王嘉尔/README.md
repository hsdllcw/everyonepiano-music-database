### 100 Ways歌词：

You turn over the hour glass  
The sand is falling down oh it's too fast  
For you  
For you  
Don't waste your love just let it last  
Cause once it's gone it's never coming back  
It's true  
Could you love me the same  
Tell me what makes you stay  
There's a hundred ways to leave a lover  
Leave a lover  
Leave a lover  
Hundred ways to leave a lover  
Leave a lover  
Leave a  
There's a hundred ways to leave a lover  
I won't wait a minute longer  
Hundred ways to leave  
But I'm the only one that you need  
It's the final curtain call but if you're ready I will give my all  
For you  
For you  
Let them say it how they want  
If I can love you good it's no ones fault  
Oh  
Could you love me the same  
Tell me what makes you stay  
There's a hundred ways to leave a lover  
Leave a lover  
Leave a lover  
Hundred ways to leave a lover  
Leave a lover  
Leave a  
There's a hundred ways to leave a lover  
I won't wait a minute longer  
Hundred ways to leave  
But I'm the only one that you need  
I'm the only one that you need  
I'm the only one that you need  
There's a hundred ways to leave a lover  
Leave a lover  
Leave a lover  
Hundred ways to leave a lover  
Leave a lover  
Leave a  
There's a hundred ways to leave a lover  
I won't wait a minute longer  
Hundred ways to leave  
But I'm the only one that you need  
I'm the only one that you need  
I'm the only one that you need
