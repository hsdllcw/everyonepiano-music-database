### Visiting Hours歌词：

I wish that heaven had visiting hours  
So I could just show up and bring the news  
That she's getting older  
I wish that you'd met her  
Coz the things that she'll learn from me I got them all from you  
Can I just stay a while and we'll put all the world to rights  
The little ones will grow and I'll still drink your favourite wine  
And soon they're going to close but I'll see you another day  
So much has changed since you been away  
I wish that heaven had visiting hours  
So I could just swing by and ask your advice  
What would you do in my situation  
I haven't a clue how I'd even raise them  
What would you do  
Coz you always do what's right  
Can we just talk a while until my worries disappear  
I'd tell you that I'm scared of turning out a failure  
You'd say remember that the answer in the love that we create  
So much has changed since you been away  
I wish that heaven had visiting hours  
I would ask them if I could take you home  
But I know what they'd say that it's for the best  
So I will live life the way you taught me  
And make it on my own  
I will close the door but I will open up my heart  
And everyone I love will know exactly who you are  
'Cause this is not goodbye it is just until we meet again  
So much has changed since you been away
