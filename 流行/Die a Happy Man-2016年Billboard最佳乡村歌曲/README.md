Rhett开口的瞬间便被惊艳到了。旋律和嗓音真是让人觉得温暖，时光悠悠过去，那真挚的情却是雨水冲刷不掉的。很有画面感，圣诞节雪落纷纷，柔和的路灯光下，一对爱人拥抱着彼此，头抵头，那是最幸福的时刻。磁性的音嗓就如穿堂而过的风，一层层轻揭思绪的头纱，眯上双眼，陶醉其中。

### Die a Happy Man歌词：

Baby last night was hands down  
One of the best nights  
That I've had no doubt  
Between the bottle of wine  
And the look in your eyes and the marvin gaye  
Then we danced in the dark under September stars  
In the pourin' rain  
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough  
That all I need in this life is your crazy love  
If I never get to see the northern lights  
Or if I never get to see the eiffel tower at night  
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand  
Baby I could die a happy man  
Happy man baby  
Baby that red dress brings me to my knees  
Oh but that black dress makes it hard to breathe  
You're a saint you're a goddess the cutest the hottest  
A masterpiece  
It's too good to be true nothing better than you  
In my wildest dreams  
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough  
That all I need in this life is your crazy love  
If I never get to see the northern lights  
Or if I never get to see the eiffel tower at night  
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand  
Baby I could die a happy man yeah  
I don't need no vacation no fancy destination  
Baby you're my great escape  
We could stay at home listen to the radio  
Or dance around the fireplace  
And if I never get to build my mansion in georgia  
Or drive a sports car up the coast of california  
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand  
Baby I could die a happy man  
Baby I could die a happy man  
Oh I could die a happy man  
You know I could girl  
I could die I could die a happy man
