### Heart Wants What It Wants歌词：

My heart only wants what it wants what it wants what it wants  
'Til it doesn't  
I can't promise you love it was love it was love it was love  
'Til it wasn't ooh  
Already met a man like you  
Already seen all of your mo-o-o-oves  
One step ahead I'm on to you  
I feel nothing when we're loving  
When we're touching so  
Go ahead and cry a river  
Go ahead and cry a river  
You can go and fill the sea  
You can go and fill the sea  
Don't you know that you're just a game to me  
My heart only wants what it wants what it wants what it wants  
'Til it doesn't  
I can't promise you love it was love it was love it was love  
'Til it wasn't ooh  
So good 'til I get enough so good 'til I give it up  
So good but my heart is zoned on you-ou-ou 'cause  
My heart only wants what it wants what it wants what it wants  
'Til it doesn't ooh  
I've done it all to numb the pain  
There's just so many ways a heart can break  
Can't hold a candle in the rain  
I feel nothing when we're touching  
When we're loving so  
Go ahead and cry a river  
Go ahead and cry a river  
You can go and fill the sea  
You can go and fill the sea  
Don't you know that you're just a game to me  
My heart only wants what it wants what it wants what it wants  
'Til it doesn't  
I can't promise you love it was love it was love it was love  
'Til it wasn't ooh  
So good 'til I get enough so good 'til I give it up  
So good but my heart is zoned on you-ou-ou 'cause  
My heart only wants what it wants what it wants what it wants  
'Til it doesn't  
And it don't want you you  
'Til 'til 'til it doesn't  
You  
And it don't want you  
'Til 'til 'til it doesn't  
'Til 'til 'til it doesn't
