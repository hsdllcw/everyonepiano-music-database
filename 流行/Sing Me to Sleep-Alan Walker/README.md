### Sing Me to Sleep歌词：

Wait a second, let me catch my breath  
Remind me how it feels to hear your voice  
Your lips are movin', I can't hear a thing  
Livin' life as if we had a choice  
Anywhere, any time  
I would do anything for you  
Anything for you  
Yesterday got away  
Melody stuck inside your head  
A song in every breath

Sing Me to Sleep now  
Sing Me to Sleep  
So Sing Me to Sleep now  
Sing Me to Sleep

Remember me, no time cannot erase  
I can hear your whispers in my mind  
I've become what you cannot embrace  
Our memory will be my lullaby

Sing Me to Sleep now  
Sing Me to Sleep  
Won't you Sing Me to Sleep now?  
Sing Me to Sleep

A-anytime  
I would do  
Time away  
Yesterday-day  
A-anytime  
I would do  
Time away  
Yesterday-day
