### Love To Hate Me歌词：

Love l- l- love l- l- love  
How you love to hate me  
Kinda sad that you always been like that  
See me making waves and you don't like that  
Driving through your puddles goin' splish splash  
Splish splash splish splash  
Stressing over nothing baby relax  
While you gettin' angry Imma kick back  
Only thing I think about is big stacks  
Racks racks  
Negative days negative nights  
Baby you're wasting all your time  
I can't relate I keep it light  
No no no drama in my life  
Wake up yeah  
Makeup maybe  
I need you nah  
I been good lately  
Blowin' up  
Workin' busy  
You ain't worth my love  
If you only love to hate me  
Love l- l- love l- l- love  
How you love to hate me  
Love l- l- love l- l- love  
You ain't worth my love if you only love to hate me  
Imma let you fade into the background  
Baby all my shows are gettin' too loud  
Keep on turin' it up when you want me down  
Negative days negative nights  
Baby you're wasting all your time  
I can't relate I keep light  
No no no drama in my life  
Wake up yeah  
Makeup maybe  
I need you nah  
I been good lately  
Blowin' up  
Workin' busy  
You ain't worth my love  
If you only love to hate me  
Love l- l- love l- l- love  
How you love to hate me  
Love l- l- love l- l- love  
You ain't worth my love if you only love to hate me  
Love to hate me you hate to love me  
I'm takin back what you've taken from me  
You're mistaken honey this something that  
Remind me why I be alone on my own  
If I needed you I'd have you that I know hold up  
I could do bad by myself don't need help  
One of a kind the hand that I was dealt like oh well  
Felt cupid was stupid I should have knew it  
Cause I been through it  
You wouldn't do it if it ain't foolish stupid  
You ain't worth my love  
If you only love to hate me  
Love l- l- love l- l- love  
How you love to hate me  
Love l- l- love l- l- love  
You ain't worth my love if you only love to hate me  
Love l- l- love l- l- love  
How you love to hate me  
Love l- l- love l- l- love  
You ain't worth my love if you only love to hate me
