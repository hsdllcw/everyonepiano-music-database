**Girls Girls Boys双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

Girls Girls Boys_ 是由美国乐队panic at the disco演唱的歌曲。Panic! At The
Disco这名字看来有点古怪。根据他们的解释，"Panic"一字是引自加洲奥兰治县(The O.C.!!)乐队Name Taken中的一句歌词，以及The
Smiths的同名歌曲而作成的。虽然他们没有对At The Disco作任何注解，但是凭着这个字根，你也可以想象他们的音乐类型了。《A
Fever...》售卖首周便能卖出超过一万只，以一队从未作过现场演出的乐队(真的!)已算很不错。他们更於Billboard
200大碟榜中排112、Billboard独立排行榜中排第六。这些都不太重要，他们更於年青乐队中地位甚重的purevolume中的"十队最佳已签约乐队"中长期进占其中。

### Girls Girls Boys歌词:

I don't wanna hear you've got a boyfriend  
Sometimes you're better off alone  
But if you change your mind, you know where I am  
Yeah if you change your mind, you know  
Where to find me  
'Cause I don't ever wanna be your boyfriend

And never did I think that I  
Would be caught in the way you got me  
Push another girl aside and just give in

Girls love girls and boys  
Girls love girls and boys  
And never did I think that I  
Would be caught in the way you got me  
But girls love girls and boys  
And love is not a choice

Pose, you've gotta save your reputation  
They're close to finding out about your girlfriend  
But if you change your mind, you know where I am  
Yeah if you change your mind, you know  
Where to find me  
'Cause I don't wanna save your reputation

And never did I think that I  
Would be caught in the way you got me  
Push another girl aside and just give in

Girls love girls and boys  
Girls love girls and boys  
And never did I think that I  
Would be caught in the way you got me  
But girls love girls and boys  
And love is not a choice

I am just a villain vying for attention  
From a girl  
A girl who can't decide and here's the reason why

Girls love girls and boys  
Girls love girls and boys  
Girls love girls and boys  
Girls love girls and boys  
And never did I think that I  
Would be caught in the way you got me  
But girls love girls and boys  
And love is not a choice
