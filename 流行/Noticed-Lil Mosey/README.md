### Noticed歌词：

Ughh ughh  
Yeah I was there yeah  
I was broke now a young n***a flexed up  
In a foreign switchin' lanes you can't catch up  
You was hatin' but you switched up 'cause  
I'm next up next up  
I got lean and some forty in my red cup  
B***hes changed and act like I ain't noticed  
Gettin' money n***a that's my main focus  
Wit 223 and you act like you don't know this  
Bro popped a bean man my n***as always rollin'  
Y'all tweaking  
Me and KK wok we always geekin' always  
Leakin yeah my fours leave yo body leaking  
I be road runnin' every season season  
And I just count the bands my neck is freezin'  
Neck is freezin' I  
Dj dee linked with southend we was thuggin' with  
Outside totin rachets holdin' on the work we runnin' holdin'  
Now we counting bands yeah my n***as always thumbin' always  
And we don't give a f**k  
'Cause my n***as always drummin'  
I was watching steady plottin' pistol totin'  
Mixing beans with my lean that s**t had me floating  
I was broke now I'm eating stomach feeling bloated  
I been showed you how to flex  
Young n***a wrote it how to flex  
I was broke now a young n***a flexed up  
In a foreign switchin' lanes you can't catch up  
You was hatin' but you switched up 'cause I'm next up  
Next up  
I got lean and some forty in my red cup  
B***hes changed and act like I ain't noticed  
Gettin' money n***a that's my main focus  
Wit 223 and you act like you don't know this  
Bro popped a bean man my n***as always rollin' rollin'  
I was just a young n***a waiting you waiting  
But now we up no worries getting faded faded  
Swear these b***hes they always playing always  
Saying I could give a f**k about what you saying  
Grew up fifty avenue  
Tweakers layed up next to dude  
Need a bigger revenue so I stayed tryna sell to you  
N***as always testing me so  
I stay with that 32  
You can't roll with bros and me  
'Cause we gon' blast that 22  
Yeah you know  
I said you know yeah  
I turn heads when I roll through yeah  
You know I'm with the with the crew yeah  
Circle small so it's just 2x2 yeah  
I was broke now a young n***a flexed up  
In a foreign switchin' lanes you can't catch up  
You was hatin' but you switched up 'cause I'm next up  
Next up I got lean and some forty in my red cup  
B***hes changed and act like I ain't noticed  
Gettin' money n***a that's my main focus  
Wit 223 and you act like you don't know this  
Bro popped a bean man my n***as always rollin' rollin'
