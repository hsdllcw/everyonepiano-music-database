《 **The Unforgiven**
》是敲击金属乐队Metallica的一首经典歌曲。其沉重的鼓和忏悔的歌词让人深有感想。其实这首歌的歌词意思比较模糊，理解为反战只是其中一个方面，但是忏悔却是毋庸置疑的。

《 _The Unforgiven_ 》这首他们的柔情作品把James
Hetfield刚柔并济的嗓音展露无遗。在一声像极的汽笛中，一连串听似简单却蕴含极高难度的吉他合弦逐步展开了前奏部分，紧随之贝司演绎出了音乐的主线，主唱刚劲沧桑的嗓音在音乐初始充分展现了他声线的粗犷特点，歌声比较“重”、“噪”，然而随之一转，主唱开始以难得展现的柔缓嗓音演绎音乐的承接部分，柔和中蕴含的沧桑悲意简直催人泪下。

Metallica无愧于重金属音乐头牌乐队的荣誉，而这首《The Unforgiven》也堪称摇滚老将柔情曲中的典范之作。

### The Unforgiven歌词：

New blood joins this earth  
And quikly he's subdued  
Through constant pain disgrace  
The young boy learns their rules  
With time the child draws in  
This whipping boy done wrong  
Deprived of all his thoughts  
The young man struggles on and on he's known  
A vow unto his own  
That never from this day  
His will they'll take away  
What I've felt  
What I've known  
Never shined through in what I've shown  
Never be  
Never see  
Won't see what might have been  
What I've felt  
What I've known  
Never shined through in what I've shown  
Never free  
Never me  
So I dub thee unforgiven  
They dedicate their lives  
To running all of his  
He tries to please them all  
This bitter man he is  
Throughout his life the same  
He's battled constantly  
This fight he cannot win  
A tired man they see no longer cares  
The old man then prepares  
To die regretfully  
That old man here is me  
What I've felt  
What I've known  
Never shined through in what I've shown  
Never be  
Never see  
Won't see what might have been  
What I've felt  
What I've known  
Never shined through in what I've shown  
Never free  
Never me  
So I dub the unforgiven  
What I've felt  
What I've known  
Never shined through in what I've shown  
Never be  
Never see  
Won't see what might have been  
What I've felt  
What I've known  
Never shined through in what I've shown  
Never free  
Never me  
So I dub the unforgiven  
Never free  
Never me  
So I dub the unforgiven  
You labeled me  
I'll label you  
So I dub the unforgiven  
Never free  
Never me  
So I dub the unforgiven  
You labeled me  
I'll label you  
So I dub the unforgiven  
Never free  
Never me  
So I dub the unforgiven
