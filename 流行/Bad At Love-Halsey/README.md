### Bad At Love歌词：

Got a boy back home in Michigan  
And it tastes like Jack when I'm kissing him  
So I told him that I never really liked his friends  
Now he's gone and he's calling me a bitch again  
There's a guy that lives in a garden state  
And he told me that we'd make it 'til we graduate  
So I told him that the music would be worth the wait  
But he wants me in the kitchen with a dinner plate  
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe  
That we're meant to be  
But jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy  
Get the best of me  
Look, I don't mean to frustrate,  
But I always make the same mistakes, yeah  
Always make the same mistakes 'cause...  
I'm bad at love, ooh-ooh  
But you can't blame me for tryin'  
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'  
You were the one, ooh-ooh  
That could finally fix me  
Lookin' at my history  
I'm bad at love  
Got a girl with California eyes  
And I thought that she could really be the one this time  
But I never got the chance to make her mine  
Because she fell in love with little thin white lines  
London girl with an attitude  
We never told no one but we look so cute  
Both got way better things to do  
But I always think about it when I'm riding through  
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe  
That I'm in too deep  
And jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy  
Get the best in me  
Look, I don't mean to frustrate,  
But I always make the same mistakes, yeah  
Always make the same mistakes 'cause...  
I'm bad at love, ooh-ooh  
But you can't blame me for tryin'  
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'  
You were the one, ooh-ooh  
That could finally fix me  
Lookin' at my history  
I'm bad at love, ooh-ooh  
Oh, you know, you know, you know, you know  
I'm bad at love, ooh-ooh  
I'm bad at love, ooh-ooh  
I know that you're afraid  
I'm gonna walk away  
Each time the feeling fades  
Each time the feeling fades  
I know that you're afraid  
I'm gonna walk away  
Each time the feeling fades  
You know I'm bad at love, ooh-ooh  
But you can't blame me for tryin'  
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'  
You were the one, ooh-ooh  
That could finally fix me  
Lookin' at my history  
I'm bad at love, ooh-ooh  
Oh, you know, you know, you know, you know  
I'm bad at love, ooh-ooh  
Oh, oh
