**Wake Up双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Wake Up_ 出自美国歌手Alicia Keys的第二张录音室专辑The Diary of Alicia
Keys。发行后的第一周，这张专辑横扫唱片店货架，售出了61万8千张，这样的成绩比她第一张专辑《Songs in A
Minor》最高24万张的单周销量高出一倍还要多的多，同时这也令这张专辑毫无阻力的登上了Billboard排行榜冠军的宝座。而着眼新专辑的音乐方面，Alicia
Keys更是没有让人失望，这张由各路精英打造出来的专辑证明了Alicia Keys并没有被五项葛莱美奖杯的压力所压倒。

### Wake Up歌词：

[Verse 1:]  
You used to be my closest ally  
In this cold cold world of deception and lies  
We would defend and protect one another  
Now I can't tell if we're enemies or lovers

[Bridge:]  
So who's gonna rescue us from ourselves

[Hook:]  
When we gonna wake up baby?  
When it's time for lovin'  
When we gonna wake up my baby?  
Before it's too late?

[Verse 2:]  
Oh, baby, where did we go wrong, baby?  
Did this cold, cold world turn us into stone?  
Now all I battle is your ego and your pride  
It's ticking like a time bomb, ready too ignite  
Hurtin' me to fight

[Bridge:]  
Who's gonna rescue us from ourselves

[Hook2:]  
When we gonna wake up baby?  
It's time for lovin'  
When it's time for lovin'  
Before it's too late?

[Bridge:]  
When the smoke clears  
What will be left for us but tears and pain  
Why must we argue over the same things  
Just to make up and go back again  
It's never too late  
But it's been too long  
Can't get it right when no one thinks they're wrong  
Gotta get out of bed  
And take a look at what's going on  
[Hook and out]
