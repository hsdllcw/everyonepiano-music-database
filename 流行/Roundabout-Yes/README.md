### Roundabout歌词：

I'll be the round about  
The words will make you out and out  
You change the day your way  
Call it morning driving thru the sound and  
In and out the valley  
The music dance and sing  
They make the children really ring  
I spend the day your way  
Call it morning driving through the sound and  
In and out the valley  
In and around the lake  
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there  
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you  
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too  
Twenty four before my love you'll see  
I'll be there with you  
I will remember you  
Your silhouette will charge the view  
Of distance atmosphere  
Call it morning driving thru the sound and  
Even in the valley  
In and around the lake  
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there  
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you  
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too  
Twenty four before my love you'll see  
I'll be there with you  
Along the drifting cloud the eagle searching  
Down on the land  
Catching the swirling wind the sailor sees  
The rim of the land  
The eagle's dancing wings create as weather  
Spins out of hand  
Go closer hold the land feel partly no more  
Than grains of sand  
We stand to lose all time a thousand answers  
By in our hand  
Next to your deeper fears we stand  
Surrounded by a million years  
I'll be the roundabout  
The words will make you out and out  
I'll be the roundabout  
The words will make you out and out  
In and around the lake  
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there  
Twenty four before my love you'll see  
I'll be there with you  
I'll be the roundabout  
The words will make you out and out  
I spend the day your way  
Call it morning driving thru the sound and  
In and out the valley  
In and around the lake  
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there  
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you  
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too  
Twenty four before my love you'll see  
I'll be there with you
