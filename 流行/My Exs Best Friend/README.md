### My Ex's Best Friend歌词：

Machine Gun Kelly/blackbear：  
Ayy  
You know my ex so that makes it all feel complicated yeah  
It all seems complicated  
I read those texts that you sent to yours  
But I'll never say it yeah  
I'll never say  
Machine Gun Kelly：  
You walked in my life at 2 AM  
'Cause my boys knew girl that's your best friend  
Act like you don't see me won't play pretend  
Your eyes already told me what you never said  
Now we're in the backseat of the black car goin' home  
When she ask me "Is it wrong if I come up with you"  
We're both drunk on the elevator  
When I kissed you for the first time in New York City uh  
Machine Gun Kelly：  
I swear to God I never fall in love  
Then you showed up and I can't get enough of it  
I swear to God I never fall in love  
I never fall in love but I can't get enough of it  
Blackbear：  
First off I'm not sorry I won't apologize to nobody  
You play like I'm invisible girl don't act like you ain't saw me  
Last year was a mess and how I acted was beyond me  
But the past still revolves me you text me I ain't responding  
But now s**t's done changed go our separate ways  
But look at this damage you did to me  
I still want nothing to do between you and me  
Please don't say nothin' at all sound so true to me  
We don't got nothin' to say hey  
Machine Gun Kelly：  
I swear to God I never fall in love  
Then you showed up and I can't get enough of it  
I swear to God I never fall in love  
I never fall in love but I can't get enough of it  
I swear to God I never fall in love  
Then you showed up and I can't get enough of it  
I swear to God I never fall in love  
I never fall in love but I can't get enough of it  
Machine Gun Kelly/blackbear：  
You know my ex so that makes it all feel complicated yeah  
It all seems complicated  
I read those texts that you sent to yours  
But I'll never say it yeah  
I'll never say
