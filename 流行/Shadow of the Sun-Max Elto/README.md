《 **Shadow of the Sun** 》是Max Elto演唱的歌曲，发行于2013年12月。

Max Elto也被称为Taped Rai是一个瑞典演唱组合，由Tom Liljegren和Alexander Ryberg组成。

这首歌能翻红，大概是因为它太有OST的质感了。黯淡的光影，流逝的年华，无望的等候，温柔深情的口吻诉说了一份无法言说，只能埋藏在心底的爱。

### Shadow of the Sun歌词：

They say that life is always easier  
After you let yourself come undone  
They say they'll give you all that you want  
And I'll be waiting in the shadow of the sun  
Seizing doubt when always been before  
Close the curtains what are you waiting for  
And I'll be keeping secrets till I'm in the ground  
Changing colors makes you waste away  
Just paint your eyes with a vivid mind  
Now you see what's behind the lights  
And I'll be waiting in the shadow of the sun  
Finding treasures that has been on demise  
Building mountains in disguise  
And I'll be keeping secrets till I'm in the ground  
I'm in the shadow of the shadow of the sun  
Where I belong there's something coming on  
I'm in the shadow of the shadow of the sun  
Oh and I need you  
I'm in the shadow of the shadow of the sun  
Where I belong there's something coming on  
No more waiting times are changing  
And there's something coming on
