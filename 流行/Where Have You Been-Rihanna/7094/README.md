### Where Have You Been歌词：

I've been everywhere  
Looking for someone  
Someone who can please me  
Love me all night long  
I've been everywhere  
Looking for you baby  
Looking for you baby  
Searching for you baby  
Where have you been  
Cause I never see you out  
Are you hiding from me yeah  
Somewhere in the crowd  
Where have you been  
All my life all my life  
Where have you been all my life  
Where have you been all my life  
Where have you been all my life  
Where have you been all my life  
I've been everywhere  
Looking for someone  
Someone who can please me  
Love me all night long  
I've been everywhere  
Looking for you babe  
Looking for you babe  
Searching for you babe  
Where have you been  
Cause I never see you out  
Are you hiding from me yeah  
Somewhere in the crowd  
Where have you been  
All my life, all my life  
Where have you been all my life  
Where have you been all my life  
Where have you been all my life  
Where have you been all my life  
Where have you been all my life  
You can have all you want  
Any way, any day  
To show me where you are tonight  
I've been everywhere man  
Looking for someone  
Someone who can please me  
Love me all night long  
I've been everywhere  
Looking for you baby  
Looking for you baby  
Searching for you baby
