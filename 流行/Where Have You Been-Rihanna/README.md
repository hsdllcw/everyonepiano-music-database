**Where Have You Been** 是Rihanna 演唱的歌曲，这首歌曲是一首充满异域风情的舞曲，收录在专辑《Talk That
Talk》中，于2011年11月21日发行。

  
单曲《 _Where Have You Been_
》，这次MV中RiRi大玩异域性感风，从出水芙蓉的诱惑，西域情调面纱的神秘，再到尽显狂野的原始部落舞蹈，RiRi打造出一部充满着异域风情的歌舞盛宴。
从水中诱惑现身，随后更大跳强劲舞蹈，搭配上歌曲的节奏真是太有冲击力了，而后半部分的分身幻影仿佛西域公主弄舞于人间，RiRi总是这么个性十足又叫人充满惊喜。

  
开场出水的那一刻像印度电影欲蛇一般，蜕变成沙漠狂野性感的女首领。摩登爆炸头那部分的舞蹈更是赏心悦目，异域性感风一览无余。最后千手观音的那段美轮美奂，完全觉得像是在看一部微电影。

### Where Have You Been歌词：

I've been everywhere, man  
Looking for someone  
Someone who can please me  
Love me all night long  
I've been everywhere, man  
Looking for you babe  
Looking for you babe  
Searching for you babe

Where have you been

Cause I never see you out  
Are you hiding from me, yeah  
Somewhere in the crowd

Where have you been  
All my life all my life  
Where have you been, all my life  
Where have you been, all my life  
Where have you been, all my life  
Where have you been, all my life

I've been everywhere, man  
Looking for someone  
Someone who can please me  
Love me all night long  
I've been everywhere, man  
Looking for you babe  
Looking for you babe  
Searching for you babe

Where have you been  
Cause I never see you out  
Are you hiding from me, yeah?  
Somewhere in the crowd

Where have you been  
All my life, all my life

Where have you been, all my life  
Where have you been, all my life  
Where have you been, all my life  
Where have you been, all my life

Where have you been, all my life

You can have all you want  
Any way, any day  
To show me where you are tonight

I've been everywhere, man  
Looking for someone  
Someone who can please me  
Love me all night long  
I've been everywhere, man  
Looking for you babe  
Looking for you babe  
Searching for you babe
