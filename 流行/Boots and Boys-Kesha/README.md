### Boots & Boys歌词：

(Boots, boys)  
I think it's time that I mention  
I've got myself an obsession  
For the smell, for the touch

I know I got myself a habit  
But I've got to have it now  
I don't care where; work it out  
(Let me break it down)

I try it on, I take it off  
So what you got?  
Something 'bout

Boots and boys (boots and boys)  
They bring me so much joy (bring me joy)  
(I gotta say it)  
I wear 'em both so pretty as I walk in the city  
(Watch out)

Boots and boys  
(Give me boots and boys)  
Boots and boys  
(Give me boots and boys)  
Oh

I'm keeping quite the collection  
Take nothing less than perfection  
Cowboy boots, cowboy boys  
Mmm, oh the joy

My men drop beats like a bomb  
Excuse me, now, huh?  
Wind me up, spin me 'round  
Oh, look at what I've found

Boots and boys (boots and boys)  
They bring me so much joy (bring me joy)  
(I gotta say it)  
I wear 'em both so pretty as I walk in the city  
(Watch out)

Crazy for you, crazy for you (give me boots and boys)  
I'm crazy for you, crazy for you (give me boots and boys)  
I'm crazy for you, crazy for you (give me boots and boys)  
(Oh)

(Hey) watcha lookin' at?  
(Hey) something you can't have  
(Yeah) they've got me lookin' rad  
Ya feelin' that?

Boots and boys (boots and boys)  
They bring me so much joy (bring me joy)  
(I gotta say it)  
I wear 'em both so pretty as I walk in the city  
(Watch out)

Boots and boys (boots and boys)  
They bring me so much joy (bring me joy)  
(I gotta say it)  
I wear 'em both so pretty as I walk in the city  
(Watch out)

Crazy for you, crazy for you (give me boots and boys)  
I'm crazy for you, crazy for you (give me boots and boys)  
I'm crazy for you, crazy for you (give me boots and boys)  
(Oh)
