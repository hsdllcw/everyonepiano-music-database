### Hear Me Cry歌词：

You couldn't say  
needed someone new  
You actually thought  
deep inside I knew  
Can you tell me How can you say  
Why this should suffice  
You passed me by  
and your heart as cold as ice  
(You passed me by)  
Did you see me cry  
(Did you ask yourself why)  
Did you see me cry  
(Did you ask yourself how)  
Can you hear me cry  
(Did you ask yourself)  
Will we ever grow apart  
You, you couldn't say  
needed someone new  
and you actually thought  
deep inside I knew  
I wonder where we will go  
Will we be the same  
(You passed me by)  
I laugh inside I think of you  
and the love we made  
(You passed me by)  
Tell me why this should suffice  
I hold you through the night  
Now will I let it go  
Soon I'll let it go  
Can you hear me cry  
(Will you ask yourself why)  
Can you hear me cry  
(Will you ask yourself how)  
Can you hear me cry  
(Will you ask yourself)  
Will we ever grow apart  
You, I'll stand by your side  
I'll be there for you  
(You passed me by)  
You, I'll stand by your side  
Please just do me right  
(You passed me by)  
You, I'll stand by your side  
I'll be there for you
