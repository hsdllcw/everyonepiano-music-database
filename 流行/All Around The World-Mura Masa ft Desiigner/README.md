### All Around The World歌词：

This goes for all around the world (grrrrah)  
'Til the world is gone  
This goes all around the world (grrrrah)  
So we carry on  
This goes for all around the world (grrrrah)  
'Til the world is gone  
This goes all around the world (grrrrah)  
So we carry on, git, git!  
Thank God I got it  
Thank God, yeah, nigga, I got it  
Thank God, cut the checks, they watchin'  
Thank God I be gettin', can't stop it  
Thank God I got it  
Thank God I be countin' this money  
Thank God, thinkin', livin', they funny  
Livin' close, yeah and countin' these hundreds, oh shit  
I be livin' life on the ball shit  
I'ma cop me a wheel and I ghost it  
Black and white, it's the panda, the ghost is  
Give a toast to the Grammy's, I go shit  
All night with the bag  
All night with the swag  
All night with the bag  
Alllllll  
This goes for all around the world (grrrrah)  
'Til the world is gone  
This goes all around the world (grrrrah)  
So we carry on  
This goes for all around the world (grrrrah)  
'Til the world is gone  
This goes all around the world (grrrrah)  
So we carry on, yeah, yeah  
They say I go, got it, I go, get  
I'm on top of the world on my ball shit  
In the party, get it started, get retarded  
Baby what's your favorite color Aston Martin?  
Gotta hit on the gas just to get it started  
Gotta kick on the gas just to get it started  
Hear the 'Rari, hear it mumble, hear it roar  
Say that she hate monsters  
Engine started, she hate monsters  
Engine farted, she hate monsters  
Get retarded, I've been chillin'  
I drink out and go to Beamers  
Lord I need it, Lord I need it, Lord I need it  
Got them mad 'cause I drill and they all defeated  
I be ridin', keep sayin', "Lord, 'cause I need it"  
Lord I need it, Lord I need it, Lord I need it  
'Cause he help me come back from all my demons  
This goes for all around the world (grrrrah)  
'Til the world is gone  
This goes all around the world (grrrrah)  
So we carry on  
This goes for all around the world (grrrrah)  
'Til the world is gone  
This goes all around the world (grrrrah)  
So we carry on
