### Bloody Valentine歌词：

The simulation just went bad but you're the best I ever had  
Like hand prints in wet cement she touch me it's permanent  
In my head in my head I couldn't hear anything you said but  
In my head in my head I'm calling you girlfriend what the f**k  
I don't do fake love but I'll take some from you tonight  
I know I've got to go but I might just miss the flight  
I can't stay forever let's play pretend  
And treat this night like it'll happen again  
You'll be my bloody valentine tonight  
I'm overstimulated and I'm sad  
I don't expect you to understand  
There's nothing less than true romance or am I just making a mess  
In my head in my head I'm lying naked with you yeah  
In my head in my head I'm ready to die holding your hand  
I don't do fake love but I'll take some from you tonight  
Take some from you tonight  
I know I've got to go but I might just miss the flight  
I can't stay forever let's play pretend  
And treat this night like it'll happen again  
You'll be my bloody valentine tonight  
I can't hide how I feel about you  
Inside I gave everything up  
Tonight if I could just have you  
Be my be my baby  
I can't hide how I feel about you  
I cannot hide these feelings  
Inside I gave everything up  
)I cannot hide these feelings  
Tonight if I could just have you  
I gave up everything for you  
Be my be my  
I gave up everything  
Ayy  
I don't do fake love but I'll take some from you tonight  
Take some from you tonight  
I know I've got to go but I might just miss the flight  
I can't stay forever let's play pretend  
And treat this night like it'll happen again  
You'll be my bloody valentine tonight  
Na-na-na na-na-na na-na-na  
Just tonight  
Na-na-na na-na-na na-na-na  
Just tonight  
Na-na-na na-na-na na-na-na  
Just tonight  
Na-na-na na-na-na na-na-na  
Just tonight  
Were we on two track
