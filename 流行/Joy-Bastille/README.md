### Joy歌词：

Thought I'd never be waking on the kitchen floor  
But here I lie not the first time  
Now my morning has broken and it brings the fear  
My mind's falling falling  
Then I feel my pulse quickening  
But regrets can't change anything  
Yeah I feel my pulse quickening  
When your name lights up the screen  
Oh Joy when you call me  
I was giving up oh I was giving in  
Joy set my mind free  
I was giving up oh I was giving in  
How'd you always know when I'm down  
How'd you always know when I'm down  
Take a walk through the wreckage clearing out my head  
I hear your eyes roll right down the phone  
I'm your walking disaster keep on dragging me  
From self-pity poor me  
Then I feel my pulse quickening  
But I wouldn't change a thing  
Oh Joy when you call me  
I was giving up oh I was giving in  
Joy set my mind free  
I was giving up oh I was giving in  
How'd you always know when I'm down  
How'd you always know when I'm down  
As the night dissolves into this final frame  
You're a sweet relief you saved me from my brain  
From my brain from my brain from my brain  
Brain brain brain brain brain brain brain  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh Joy when you called me  
I was giving up oh I was giving in  
Joy set my mind free  
I was giving up oh I was giving in  
How'd you always know when I'm down  
How'd you always know when I'm down  
I feel joy when you call me  
I feel joy when you call me I-I-I feel joy  
I feel joy when you call me  
I feel joy when you call me  
How'd you always know when I'm down  
How'd you always know when I'm down
