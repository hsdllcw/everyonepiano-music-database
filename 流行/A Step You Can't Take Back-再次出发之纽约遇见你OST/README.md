A Step You Can't Take Back歌词：

So you find yourself at this subway  
With your world in a bag by your side  
And all at once it seemed like a good way  
You realize it's the end of the line  
For what it's worth

Here comes the train upon the track  
And there goes the pain, it cuts to black  
Are you ready for the last act?  
To take a step you can't take back?

Taken all the punches you could take  
Took 'em all right on the chest  
Now the camel's back is breaking  
Again, again  
For what it's worth

Here comes the train upon the track  
And there goes the pain, it cuts to black  
Are you ready for the last act?  
To take a step you can't take back?

Did she love you?  
Did she take you down?  
Was she on her knees when she kissed your crown?  
Tell me what you found

Here comes the rain, so hold your hat  
And don't pray to God, 'cause He won't talk back  
Are you ready for the last act?  
To take a step you can't take back, back, back?  
You can't take back, back, back.

So you find yourself at this subway  
With your world in a bag by your side
