### Emotions歌词：

In my head she said it's all in my head  
My head  
But it's not think I'd rather be dead  
Be dead  
Can't forgive or forget what you did  
You did  
She said I drove her away with my emotions  
I drove her away  
Can't take the pain anymore I'm feeling hopeless  
Can't take the pain  
In my head she said it's all in my head  
My head  
But it's not think I'd rather be dead  
Be dead  
Can't forgive or forget what you did  
You did  
I don't even know why I try  
You did me wrong  
And I can't forget that  
Tell me what you want  
I know it's a lie  
Lie  
You broke my heart  
And you cannot fix that  
You can't erase what you've done to me  
But certainly all you do is burden me  
It's hurting deep  
Our past is like a blur to me  
It's hard to see but look what you have done to me  
What you want  
What you want from me  
What you want  
What you want from me  
What you want  
What you want from me  
In my head she said it's all in my head  
My head  
But it's not think I'd rather be dead  
Be dead  
Can't forgive or forget what you did  
You did  
She said I drove her away with my emotions  
I drove her away  
Can't take the pain anymore I'm feeling hopeless  
Can't take the pain  
In my head she said it's all in my head  
My head  
But it's not think I'd rather be dead  
Be dead  
Can't forgive or forget what you did  
You did  
In my head she said it's all in my head  
My head  
But it's not think I'd rather be dead  
Be dead  
Can't forgive or forget what you did  
You did
