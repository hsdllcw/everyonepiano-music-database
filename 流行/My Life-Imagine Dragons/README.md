### My Life歌词：

Can I wish on a star for another life  
'Cause it feels like I'm all on my own tonight  
And I find myself in pieces  
There are pills on the table and a thought in my head  
And I walk through the halls where I used to be led  
My heart is filled with reasons  
I'm trying to be somebody else  
I'm finding it hard to love myself  
I've wanted to be somebody new  
But that is impossible to do  
I'm running out of my mind  
Is this really my life  
I'm running out of time  
Is this really my life  
My life  
I could run from it all but I'd only get lost  
Oh I've walked down the bridge that I shouldn't have crossed  
And I find myself a user  
Oh I wake every day with addictions to feed  
They all call me a friend but I'll never be freed  
From the face of a faithless future  
I'm trying to be somebody else  
I'm finding it hard to love myself  
I've wanted to be somebody new  
But that is impossible to do  
I'm running out of my mind  
Is this really my life  
I'm running out of time  
Is this really my life  
My life  
These years pass by and we're growing older  
And I think of you oh we've made it through  
Some have passed away some have moved on  
But I'm still here today  
I'm here today  
These years pass by and I am growing older  
And I think of you now we've made it through  
Some have passed away there's no words to say  
No second tries is this my life  
And I think of you  
I'm running out of my mind  
Is this really my life  
I'm running out of time  
Is this really my life  
My life
