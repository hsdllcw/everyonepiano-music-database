### Enchanters歌词：

Enchanters  
The time has come to be alive  
With the Circle of Magi  
Where we will thrive  
With our brothers  
Enchanters remind  
That time will not unwind  
The dragon's crooked spine  
Will never straighten into line  
What we plea will be  
A faithful end decree  
Where a man will not retreat  
From the defeat of his fathers  
Enchanters  
A time has come for battle lines  
We will cut these knotted ties  
And some may live and some may die  
Enchanter come to me  
Enchanter come to me  
Enchanter come to see  
Can-a you can-a you come to see  
As you once were blind  
In the light now you can sing  
In our strength we can rely  
And history will not repeat  
Enchanter come to me  
Enchanter come to me  
Enchanter come to see  
Can-a you can-a you come to see  
As you once were blind  
In the light now you can sing  
In our strength we can rely  
And history will not repeat  
Enchanters  
The time has come to be alive  
With the Circle of Magi  
Where we will thrive  
With our brothers  
Enchanters remind  
That time will not unwind  
The dragon's crooked spine  
Will never straighten into line  
What we plea will be  
A faithful end decree  
Where a man will not retreat  
From the defeat of his fathers  
Enchanters  
A time has come for battle lines  
We will cut these knotted ties  
And some may live and some may die  
Enchanter come to me  
Enchanter come to me  
Enchanter come to see  
Can-a you can-a you come to see  
As you once were blind  
In the light now you can sing  
In our strength we can rely  
And history will not repeat  
Enchanter come to me  
Enchanter come to me  
Enchanter come to see  
Can-a you can-a you come to see  
As you once were blind  
In the light now you can sing  
In our strength we can rely  
And history will not repeat
