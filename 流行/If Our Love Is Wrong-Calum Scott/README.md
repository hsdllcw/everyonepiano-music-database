### If Our Love Is Wrong歌词：

I don't know how I should say it  
In my mind it's every word  
That they don't wanna hear  
I don't know how they might take it  
Maybe you can take the pressure  
And make it disappear  
Throw out the inhibition  
You make me feel a feeling that I've never felt before  
I don't know if they're gonna like it  
But that only makes me want it more  
Cause I'm nobody's but yours  
If it's me  
And if it's you  
And if our love is wrong  
Then I don't ever wanna be right  
I don't ever wanna be right  
If it's real  
And if it's true  
And if our love is wrong  
Then I don't ever wanna be right  
I don't ever wanna be right  
Oh yeah oh yeah  
I just want you to be mine  
Why would I need their permission  
Skin and bones I'm only human  
It's in my DNA  
Suffocating just to fit in  
Why do I care what people say  
Cause I'm nobody's but yours  
If it's me  
And if it's you  
And if our love is wrong  
Then I don't ever wanna be right  
I don't ever wanna be right  
If it's real  
And if it's true  
And if our love is wrong  
Then I don't ever wanna be right  
I don't ever wanna be right  
Oh yeah oh  
I just want you to be mine  
Oh yeah oh  
I just want you to be mine
