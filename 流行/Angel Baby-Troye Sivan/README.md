### Angel Baby歌词：

I need a lover to keep me sane  
Pull me from hell bring me back again  
Play me the classics something romantic  
Give him my all when I don't even have it  
I always dreamed of a solemn face  
Someone who feels like a holiday  
But now I'm in pieces barely believing  
Starting to think that I've lost all feeling  
You came out the blue on a rainy night no lie  
I tell you how I almost died while you're bringing me back to life  
I just wanna live in this moment forever  
'Cause I'm afraid that living couldn't get any better  
Started giving up on the word forever  
Until you gave up heaven so we could be together  
You're my angel angel baby  
Angel you're my angel baby  
Baby you're my angel angel baby  
I'll fall in love with the little things  
Counting the tattoos on your skin  
Tell me a secret  
And baby I'll keep it  
And maybe we can play house for the weekend  
You came out the blue on a rainy night no lie  
I'll tell you how I almost died  
While you're bringing me back to life  
I just wanna live in this moment forever  
'Cause I'm afraid that living couldn't get any better  
Started giving up on the word forever  
Until you gave up heaven so we could be together  
You're my angel angel baby  
Angel you're my angel baby  
Baby you're my angel angel baby  
All the sick and twisted nights that I've been waiting for ya  
They were worth it all along yeah  
I just wanna live in this moment forever  
'Cause I'm afraid that living couldn't get any better  
Started giving up on the word forever  
Ooh forever  
Until you gave up heaven so we could be together  
You're my angel angel baby  
Angel you're my angel baby  
Baby you're my angel angel baby  
Angel angel baby  
Angel you're my angel baby  
Baby you're my angel angel baby
