### When You Really Love Someone歌词：

I'm a woman, lord knows it's hard  
I need a real man to give me what I need  
Sweet attention, love and tenderness  
When it's real it's unconditional, I'm telling y'all

[Chorus:]

Cause a man, just ain't a man,  
If he aint' man enough  
To love you when you're right,  
Love you when you're wrong  
Love you when you're weak,  
Love you when you're strong  
Take you higher  
When the world got you feelin low.  
He's given you his last, cuz he's thinking of you first  
Given comfort when you're thinking that you're hurt  
That's what's done when you really love someone  
I'm telling y'all, I'm telling y'all.  
Cause you're a real man and lord knows it's hard  
Sometimes you just need a woman's touch  
Sweet affection, love and support  
When it's real, it's unconditional, I'm telling y'all

[Chorus:]

Oh cause a woman ain't a woman if she ain't woman enough  
To love you when you're right  
Love you when you're wrong  
Love you when you're weak,  
Love you when you're strong  
Take you higher  
When the world got you feelin low.  
She's giving you her best, even when you're at your worst  
Givin comfort, when she's thinking that you're hurt  
That's what's done, when you really love someone  
I'm telling y'all  
Whooo  
Whooo  
Whooo  
Whooo  
Whooo  
Whooo  
Sometimes you gonna argue  
Sometimes you gonna fight  
Sometimes it's gonna feel like it will never be right  
But something so strong, keeps you holdin on  
It don't make sense, but it make a good song  
Cause a man, just ain't a man,  
If he ain't man enough  
To love you when you're right,  
Love you when you're wrong  
Love you when you're weak,  
Love you when you're strong  
Take you higher  
When the world got you feelin low  
He's given you his last, cuz he's thinking of you first  
Given comfort when you're thinking that you're hurt  
That's what's done when you really love someone  
I'm telling y'all, I'm telling y'all, I'm telling y'all  
That a woman ain't a woman if she ain't woman enough  
To love you when you're right  
Love you when you're wrong  
Love you when you're weak,  
Love you when you're strong  
Take you higher and higher  
When the world got you feelin low.  
She's giving you her best, even when you're at your worst  
Givin comfort, when she's thinking that you're hurt  
That's what's done, when you really love someone  
I'm telling y'all  
I'm telling y'all  
Hmm hmm yeah  
Hmm hmm yeah  
Hmm hmm yeah  
Hmm hmm yeah  
Hmm hmm yeah  
Hmm hmm yeah
