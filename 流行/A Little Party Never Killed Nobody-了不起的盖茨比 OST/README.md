### A Little Party Never Killed Nobody歌词：

Verse 1 Fergie:  
I ain't got time for you baby  
Either you're mine, or you're not  
Make up your mind sweet baby  
Right here, right now's all we got  
A little party never killed nobody  
So we gonna dance until we drop, drop  
A little party never killed nobody  
Right here, right now's all we got

All these diamonds, trips around the world  
Don't mean a thing if I ain't your girl  
A little party never killed nobody  
So we gonna dance until we drop, drop  
A little party never killed nobody  
Right here, right now's all we got  
A little party never killed nobody  
So we gonna dance until we drop, drop  
A little party never killed nobody  
Right here, right now's all we got

Q-Tip  
All we got, all we got, all we got, all we got  
All we got, all we got, all we got, all we got  
Glad that you made it, look around  
You don't see one person sitting down  
They got drinks in their hands,  
And the rooms a bust  
At the end of the night maybe you'll find love  
Fake chit chat bout the things they got  
And my scout reputation keeping it hot girl  
At the party of the year I'm a master plan  
If you make me realize I'm your man

Fergie:  
If the people get lost, underneath the moonlight  
Hotsy-totsy, paparazzi, hold it while I take this flick  
Speak easy, rocking the feathers I'm breezy  
Hope you can keep up boys, cause believe me, I'm the bee's knees

It don't mean a thing if I give you my heart  
If you tear it apart, no, ah, ah, ah, oh.  
It don't mean a thing if I ain't in your eyes  
Probably that ain't gonna fly, no, ah, ah, ah, oh  
It don't mean a thing if I give you my heart  
If you tear it apart, no, ah, ah, ah, oh.  
It don't mean a thing if I ain't in your eyes  
Probably that ain't gonna fly, no, ah, ah, ah, oh

Just one nights all we got  
Just one nights all we got  
Just one nights all we got  
Just one nights all we got

What do you think Goonrock?  
Are you ready?

A little party never killed nobody  
So we gonna dance until we drop, drop  
A little party never killed nobody  
Right here, right now's all we got

A little party never killed nobody  
So we gonna dance until we drop, drop  
A little party never killed nobody
