### Hallucinate歌词：

Pocket full of honey and I'm ready to go  
No I ain't got no money but I'm letting you know  
That imma love you like a fool breathe you in 'till I hallucinate mm mm  
Body make you silly make you do what I want  
Oh baby I can make it pretty I could string you along  
But imma love you like a fool breathe you in 'till I hallucinate mm mm  
No I couldn't live without your touch  
No I could never have too much  
I'll breathe you in forever and ever  
Hallucinate  
I hallucinate when you call my name  
Got stars in my eyes and they don't fade when you come my way  
I'm losing my mind mind mind mind  
I hallucinate when you call my name  
Got stars in my  
Put you in my hall of fame middle of the wall  
Yeah you're my one my favourite my ride or die oh  
Yeah imma love you like a fool breathe you in till I hallucinate mm mm  
No I couldn't live without your touch  
No I could never have too much  
I'll breathe you in forever and ever  
Hallucinate  
I hallucinate when you call my name  
Got stars in my eyes and they don't fade when you come my way  
I'm losing my mind mind mind mind  
I hallucinate when you call my name  
Got stars in my  
Wanna be right where you are  
Let's go dancing in the dark  
Don't wait you can push to start  
Lose control  
Kill me slowly with your kiss  
Wrap me round your fingertips  
D**n I need another hit  
Make me lose my mind  
I hallucinate when you call my name  
Got stars in my eyes and they don't fade when you come my way  
I'm losing my mind mind mind mind  
I hallucinate when you call my name  
Got stars in my
