### Señorita歌词：

Camila Cabello：  
I love it when you call me señorita  
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya  
But every touch is ooh la la la  
It's true la la la  
Ooh I should be runnin'  
Ooh you keep me coming for ya  
Shawn Mendes：  
Land in Miami  
The air was hot from summer rain  
Sweat drippin' off me  
Before I even knew her name la la la  
It felt like ooh la la la  
Yeah noo  
Sapphire moonlight  
We danced for hours in the sand  
Tequila sunrise  
Her body fit right in my hands la la la  
It felt like ooh la la la yeah  
Both：  
I love it when you call me señorita  
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya  
But every touch is ooh la la la  
It's true la la la  
Ooh I should be runnin'  
Ooh you know I love it when you call me señorita  
I wish it wasn't so d**n hard to leave ya  
But every touch is ooh la la la  
It's true la la la  
Ooh I should be runnin'  
Ooh you keep me coming for ya  
Camila Cabello：  
Locked in the hotel  
There's just somethings that never change  
You say we're just friends  
But friends don't know the way you taste la la la  
'Cause you know it's been a long time coming don't ya let me fall ooh  
Both：  
Ooh when your lips undress me  
Hooked on your tongue  
Ooh love your kiss is deadly don't stop  
I love it when you call me señorita  
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya  
But every touch is ooh la la la  
It's true la la la  
Ooh I should be runnin'  
Ooh you know I love it when you call me señorita  
I wish it wasn't so d**n hard to leave ya  
But every touch is ooh la la la  
It's true la la la  
Ooh I should be runnin'  
Ooh you keep me coming for ya  
All along I've been coming for ya  
For you  
And I hope it means something to you  
Call my name I'll be coming for ya  
Coming for ya  
Calling for ya  
Coming for ya  
For ya  
For ya  
Oh she loves it when I come  
For ya  
Ooh I should be runnin'  
Ooh you keep me coming for ya
