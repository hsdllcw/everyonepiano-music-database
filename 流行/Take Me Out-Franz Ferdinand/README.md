### Take Me Out歌词：

So if you're lonely  
You know I'm here waiting for you  
I'm just a crosshair  
I'm just a shot away from you  
And if you leave here  
You leave me broken, shattered, I lie  
I'm just a crosshair  
I'm just a shot, then we can die

I know I won't be leaving here with you

I say don't you know  
You say you don't know  
I say... take me out!

I say you don't show  
Don't move, time is slow  
I say... take me out!

I say you don't know  
You say you don't know  
I say... take me out!

If I move this could die  
If eyes move this could die  
I want you...to take me out!

I know I won't be leaving here (with you)  
I know I won't be leaving here  
I know I won't be leaving here (with you)  
I know I won't be leaving here with you

I say don't you know?  
You say you don't know  
I say take me out

If I wane, this can die  
If I wane, this can die  
I want you to take me out

If I move, this could die  
If eyes move, this could die  
Come on, take me out

I know I won't be leaving here  
I know I won't be leaving here  
I know I won't be leaving here  
I know I won't be leaving here with you
