### Hold Back the River歌词：

Tried to keep you close to me,  
But life got in between  
Tried to square not being there  
But think that I should've been

Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes  
Hold back the river, so I  
Can stop for a minute and see where you hide  
Hold back the river, hold back

Once upon a different life  
We rode our bikes into the sky  
But now we're caught against the tide  
Those distant days all flashing by

Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes  
Hold back the river, so I  
Can stop for a minute and be by your side  
Hold back the river, hold back

Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes  
Hold back the river, so I  
Can stop for a minute and see where you hide  
Hold back the river, hold back

Oh, oho, oho, oho, oho  
Oho, oho, oho, oho

Lonely water, lonely water, won't you let us wander  
Let us hold each other  
Lonely water, lonely water, won't you let us wander  
Let us hold each other

Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes  
Hold back the river, so I  
Can stop for a minute and be by your side  
Hold back the river, hold back

Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes  
Hold back the river, so I  
Can stop for a minute and be by your side  
Hold back the river, hold

Lonely water, lonely water, won't you let us wander  
Let us hold each other  
Lonely water, lonely water, won't you let us wander  
Let us hold each other
