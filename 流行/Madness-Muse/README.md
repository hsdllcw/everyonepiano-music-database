Madness歌词：

  

(Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma...)

I, I can't get these memories out of my mind,  
And some kind of madness has started to evolve.  
(Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma...)  
And I, I tried so hard to let you go,  
But some kind of madness is swallowing me whole, yeah  
(Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma...)

I have finally seen the light,  
And I have finally realized  
What you mean.

Ooh oh oh

And now I need to know is this real love,  
Or is it just madness keeping us afloat?  
(Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma...)  
And when I look back at all the crazy fights we had,  
Like some kind of madness was taking control, yeah  
(Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma...)

And now I have finally seen the light,  
And I have finally realized  
What you need.

Mmmm...

(Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma...)

But now I have finally seen the end (finally seen the end)  
And I'm not expecting you to care (expecting you to care)  
But I have finally seen the light (finally seen the light)  
I have finally realized (realized)  
I need your love  
I need your love

Come to me  
Just in a dream.  
Come on and rescue me.  
Yes I know, I can't be wrong,  
And baby, you're too headstrong.  
Our love is  
(Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma...)  
Madness
