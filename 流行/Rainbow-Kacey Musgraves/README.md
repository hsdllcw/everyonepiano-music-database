_Rainbow_ 是美国创作型乡村女歌手Kacey
Musgraves演唱的歌曲。Kacey曾在一次采访中自豪的说到：自己很高兴能够为LBGT这个群体发声，将他们包容进乡村音乐中，创作这一首歌。无论任何群体，生活中可能都会遭受到世界的恶意，让自己世界下起暴雨，迫使撑起一把保护自己的坚硬冰冷的雨伞，但是当雨过天晴时，请一定不要忘了，放下保护的外壳，抬头享受阳光照耀，去看一看那无比绚烂的彩虹!

### Rainbow歌词：

When it rains it pours  
But you didn't even notice  
It ain't rainin' anymore  
It's hard to breathe when all you know is  
The struggle of stayin' above the risin' water line  
Well the sky has finally opened  
The rain and wind stopped blowin'  
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again  
You hold tight to your umbrella  
Well darlin' I'm just tryin' to tell ya  
That there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head  
If you could see what I see  
You'd be blinded by the colors  
Yellow red and orange and green  
And at least a million others  
So tie up the bow take off your coat and take a look around  
'Cause the sky has finally opened  
The rain and wind stopped blowin'  
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again  
You hold tight to your umbrella  
Well darlin' I'm just tryin' to tell ya  
That there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head  
Oh tie up the bow take off your coat and take a look around  
Everything is alright now  
'Cause the sky has finally opened  
The rain and wind stopped blowin'  
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again  
Let go of your umbrella  
'Cause darlin' I'm just tryin' to tell ya  
That there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head  
Yeah there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head  
It'll all be alright
