### No Body, No Crime歌词：

He did it  
He did it  
Este's a friend of mine  
We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine  
Este's been losin' sleep  
Her husband's actin' different and it smells like infidelity  
She says  
That ain't my merlot on his mouth  
That ain't my jewelry on our joint account  
No there ain't no doubt  
I think I'm gonna call him out  
She says "I think he did it but I just can't prove it"  
I think he did it but I just can't prove it  
I think he did it but I just can't prove it  
No no body no crime  
But I ain't lettin' up until the day I die  
No no  
I think he did it  
No no  
He did it  
Este wasn't there Tuesday night at Olive Garden  
At her job or anywhere  
He reports his missing wife  
And I noticed when I passed his house  
His truck has got some brand new tires  
And his mistress moved in  
Sleeps in Este's bed and everything  
No there ain't no doubt  
Somebody's gotta catch him out 'cause  
I think he did it but I just can't prove it  
I think he did it but I just can't prove it  
I think he did it but I just can't prove it  
No no body no crime  
But I ain't lettin' up until the day I die  
No no  
I think he did it  
No no  
He did it  
Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was fifteen  
And I've cleaned enough houses  
To know how to cover up a scene  
Good thing Este's sister's gonna swear she was with me  
She was with me dude  
Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy  
They think she did it but they just can't prove it  
They think she did it but they just can't prove it  
She thinks I did it but she just can't prove it  
No no body no crime  
I wasn't lettin' up until the day he  
No no body no crime  
I wasn't lettin' up until the day he  
No no body no crime  
I wasn't lettin' up until the day he died
