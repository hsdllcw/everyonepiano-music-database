### Undecided歌词：

No I don't say it often  
And I probably should've told you I hurt this bad I know  
And I probably shouldn't want this so bad  
It's weighing weighing on me  
Don't wanna wake up in the mornin'  
Cannot undo what we did in this bed  
And I can't get you out so I gotta go  
No I'm not ready for you want me all alone  
But I'm undecided excited ignited  
And I don't wanna feel the way I do but I like it  
Look at all these sparks flying  
But I'm still indecisive  
And she want me to wife it  
But I'm undecided  
I know I shouldn't be doing this but here we go again  
Girl you know that p***y is my weakness  
Weakness weakness weakness  
Girl you got me addicted when you switching positions  
You tell me "Shut up"  
And you know I listen I hate it  
Wish I never did it  
I can't keep sinning and pretending  
Ooh oh oh oh  
I'm taking off your clothes  
We getting sexual  
Hit it so good think I'll propose  
I don't know but  
I'm undecided excited  
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah ignited  
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah huh  
And I don't wanna feel the way I do but I like it  
Look at all these sparks flying  
All these all these  
But I'm still indecisive  
'Cause you want me  
And she want me to wife it  
But I'm undecided  
Do do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do do do  
Oh no I'm undecided  
Do do do do do do do yeah  
Do do do do do do do  
I said I just don't know  
Do do do do do do do do  
Ayy 'cause I'm undecided  
No no baby  
I'm afraid of your love  
Oh ooh you got me baby  
'Cause I can't get enough oh woah  
But I'm undecided excited  
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah ignited  
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah huh  
And I don't wanna feel the way I do but I like it  
Look at all these sparks flying  
But I'm still indecisive  
And she want me to wife it  
But I'm undecided  
Do do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do do do  
No no oh no and I want it

Do do do do do do do ayy
