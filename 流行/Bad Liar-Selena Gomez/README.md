### Bad Liar歌词：

I was walking down the street the other day  
Tryna distract myself  
But then I see your face  
Oh wait, that's someone else  
Oh oh, tryna play it coy  
Tryna make it disappear  
But just like the battle of Troy  
There's nothing subtle here  
In my room there's a king size space  
Bigger than it used to be  
If you want you can rent that place  
Call me an amenity  
Even if it's in my dreams  
Oooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind  
Oooh every time I watch you serpentine  
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'  
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'  
Not to think about you  
No, no, no, no, not to think about you  
No, no, no, no, I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'  
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'  
Not to give in to you  
No, no, no, no, not to give in to you  
With my feelings on fire  
Guess I'm a bad liar  
I see how your tension builds  
It's like looking in a mirror  
Your touch like a happy pill  
But still all we do is fear  
What could possibly happen next?  
Can we focus on the love?  
Paint my kiss across your chest  
If you're the art, I'll be the brush  
Oooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind  
Oooh every time I watch you serpentine  
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'  
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'  
Not to think about you (not to think about you)  
No, no, no, no, not to think about you (not to think about you)  
No, no, no, no, I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'  
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'  
Not to give in to you (give in to you)  
No, no, no, no, not to give in to you (give in to you)  
With my feelings on fire  
Guess I'm a bad liar  
And oh baby let's make  
Reality, actuality, a reality  
Oh baby let's make  
Reality, actuality, a reality  
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'  
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'  
Not to think about you (not to think about you)  
No, no, no, no, not to think about you (not to think about you)  
No, no, no, no, I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'  
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'  
Not to give in to you (give in to you)  
No, no, no, no, not to give in to you (give in to you)  
With my feelings on fire  
Guess I'm a bad liar
