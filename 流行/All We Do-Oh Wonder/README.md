_All We Do_ 是英国组合Oh
Wonder演唱的一首歌曲。虽然平淡了点，但是听着很宁静、很放松啊。有时候生活就像一条洪流把沿途所有的一切带向远方，或许你想挣扎或许你想与众不同，但生活总让你被迫走在自己不愿行走的路上，你需要找寻自己，认清内心的自己，自我才是唯一的与众不同，跟随时间的脚步勇敢的面对惨淡的人生，活出真的自我。

### All We Do歌词：

All we do is hide away  
All we do is all we do is hide away  
All we do is chase the day  
All we do is all we do is chase the day  
All we do is lie and wait  
All we do is all we do is lie and wait  
All we do is feel the fade  
All we do is all we do is feel the fade  
I've been upside down  
I don't wanna be the right way round  
Can't find paradise on the ground  
I've been upside down  
I don't wanna be the right way round  
Can't find paradise on the ground  
All we do is hide away  
All we do is all we do is hide away  
All we do is chase the day  
All we do is all we do is chase the day  
All we do is play it safe  
All we do is live inside a cage  
All we do is play it safe  
All we do all we do  
I've been upside down  
I don't wanna be the right way round  
Can't find paradise on the ground  
I've been upside down  
I don't wanna be the right way round  
Can't find paradise on the ground  
All we do is hide away  
All we do is all we do is hide away  
All we do is chase the day  
All we do is all we do is chase the day  
All I did was fail today  
All I wanna be is whites in waves  
All I did was fail today  
All we do all we do
