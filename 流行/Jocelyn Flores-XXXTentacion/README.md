_Jocelyn Flores_
是美国说唱歌手、词曲作者XXXTentacio演唱的歌曲。XXXTentacion一直是嘻哈界饱受争议的一个歌手，他的专辑《17》和《？》为自己赢得了业界赞誉和商业成功，并以风格独特的音乐而吸引了一批忠实粉丝。作为一个黑人音乐“奇才”，不寻常的成长经历让他在说唱乐方面展现出来极为罕见的惊人才华。XXXTentacion的身体里“天使和魔鬼并存”，他极为乖张的性格一定程度上导致了他所受到的挫折，乃至最终的悲剧。但这也是他音乐创作的灵感源泉。

### Jocelyn Flores歌词：

I know you so well so well  
I mean I can do better than he can  
I've been pretty  
I know you're somewhere somewhere  
I've been trapped in my mind girl just holding on  
I don't wanna pretend we're something we're nothing  
I've been stuck thinking 'bout her  
I can't hold on  
I've been pretty  
I'm in pain wanna put 10 shots in my brain  
I've been trippin' 'bout some things can't change Suicidal  
Same time I'm tame  
Picture this in bed get a phone call  
Girl that you f**ked with killed herself  
That was this summer and nobody helped  
And ever since then man I hate myself  
Wanna f**kin' end it pessimistic  
All wanna see me with no pot to piss in  
But n**gas been excited 'bout the grave I'm diggin'  
Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions  
F**kin' sickenin' at the same time  
Memories surface through the grapevine  
'Bout my uncle playin' with a slip knot  
Post-traumatic stress got me f**ked up  
Been f**ked up since the couple months  
They had a n**ga locked up  
I'll be feelin' pain  
I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on  
And I don't feel the same  
I'm so numb  
I'll be feelin' pain  
I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on  
And I don't feel the same  
I'm so numb  
I know you so well  
I know you girl  
I mean I can do better than he can  
I've been pretty  
I know you so well
