### Found You歌词：

I'd be sitting in the same old bar  
Heart breaking on a broken bar stool  
Wishing she'd come running back  
Running from the past  
Running up the tab drinking for two  
But that night my boys showed up  
Dragged me out on the town had to pick me up  
I'd never know what I was missin' if they didn't  
'Cause I'd never found you  
At that random house party  
That I didn't even wanna go to  
The way you move  
Had me first time feelin' in a while  
I should make one too  
Sometimes the finish line is just  
The start of something new  
If I'd never lost her  
Then I'd never found you  
Then I'd never found you  
Never found you  
Never found you  
Yes to go out sometimes  
But I don't never try to get that drunk  
Now I I can't sleep because you're all over me  
And she's all night keeping me up  
Yeah you talk to believe that a goodbye could be  
So good to me  
No I'd never found you  
At that random house party  
That I didn't even wanna go to  
The way you move  
Had me first time feelin' in a while  
I should make one too  
Sometimes the finish line is just  
The start of something new  
If I'd never lost her  
Then I'd never found you  
Oh I'd never found you  
Uhmm I'd never found you  
And now I'm taking back the way  
I said I wish I've never met  
Sometimes the things that don't work out  
Couldn't work out any better  
I'd never found you  
No I'd never found you  
'Cause I'd never found you  
At that random house party that  
I didn't even wanna go to  
The way you move  
Had me first time feelin' in a while  
I should make one too  
Sometimes the finish line is just  
The start of something new  
If I'd never lost her  
Then I'd never found you  
I'd never found you  
Never found never found you  
Oh I'd never found you
