### Dance With Me Tonight歌词：

Ladies and Gentlemen we've got a special treat for you tonight  
I'm gonna call my friend Olly up here to... to sing to you ladies  
Olly!  
Let's go man

My name is Olly nice to meet you can I tell you baby  
Look around there's a whole lot of pretty ladies  
But none like you, you shine so bright, yeah

I was wondering if you and me could spend a minute  
On the floor up and close getting lost in it  
I won't give up without a fight

I just wanna, oh baby  
I just want you to dance with me tonight  
So come on, oh baby  
I just want you to dance with me tonight

We're getting sweaty, hot and heavy in the crowd now  
I loosen up and let your hands go down, down  
But go with it girl, yeah just close your eyes, yeah

I feel the music moving through your body  
And looking at you I can tell you want me  
Don't stop, keep going till the morning light, yeah

When I saw you there, sitting all alone in the dark acting like you didn't
have a care  
I knew right then, that you'd be mine, and we'd be dancing the whole damn
night like

Oh baby,  
I just want you to dance with me tonight  
So come on, oh baby  
I just want you to dance with me tonight

Break it down now,  
(yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)  
Shake it like that,  
(yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)  
Now bring it all back  
To dance with me tonight  
One more time, one more time, come on now  
(yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)  
Do your thing,  
(yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)  
Everybody sing  
(I just want you to dance with me tonight)

I just wanna, oh baby  
I just want you to dance with me tonight  
Everybody everybody come on now  
Girl, just close your eyes  
We can dance all through the night,  
I just want you to dance with me tonight  
And everybody sing  
Girl just close your eyes,  
We can dance all through the night  
I just want you to dance with me tonight  
So come on girl just close your eyes  
We can dance all through the night  
I just want you to dance with me tonight
