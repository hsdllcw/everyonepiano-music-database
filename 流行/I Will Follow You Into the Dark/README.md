**I Will Follow You Into the Dark** 是Yungblud与Halsey翻唱独立乐队Death Cab for
Cutie的歌曲。该曲曾获得了2006年度的格莱美最佳单曲提名。

“我们的爱，没有什么可以分得开，就算是死亡也做不到。”

在爱人要离去时，每一个真爱过的人都会舍不得的，但不是每一个人都会选择生死相随的；不知道这是怎样深的一份爱，只知道在说出这句话时，他们的爱已经天长地久了。

这就是 _I Will Follow You Into the Dark_ 为我们描绘出的温婉晦涩又义无反顾的爱情。

### I Will Follow You Into the Dark歌词：

Love of mine some day you will die  
But I'll be close behind  
I'll follow you into the dark  
No blinding light or tunnels to gates of white  
Just our hands clasped so tight  
Waiting for the hint of a spark  
If heaven and hell decide  
That they both are satisfied  
Illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs  
If there's no one beside you  
When your soul embarks  
Then I'll follow you into the dark  
In Catholic school as vicious as Roman rule  
I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black  
And I held my tongue as she told me  
"Son fear is the heart of love"  
So I never went back  
If heaven and hell decide  
That they both are satisfied  
Illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs  
If there's no one beside you  
When your soul embarks  
Then I'll follow you into the dark  
You and me have seen everything to see  
From Bangkok to Calgary  
And the soles of your shoes are all worn down  
The time for sleep is now  
It's nothing to cry about  
Cause we'll hold each other soon  
The blackest of rooms  
If heaven and hell decide  
That they both are satisfied  
Illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs  
If there's no one beside you  
When your soul embarks  
Then I'll follow you into the dark  
Then I'll follow you into the dark
