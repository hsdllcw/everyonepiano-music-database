### Star Walkin'歌词：

Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathing  
Racing to the moonlight and I'm speeding  
I'm headed to the stars ready to go far  
I'm star walkin'  
Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathing  
Racing to the moonlight and I'm speeding  
I'm headed to the stars ready to go far  
I'm star walkin'  
On a mission to get high up I know  
That imma die reachin for a life  
That I don't really need at all  
Never listened to replies  
Learned a lesson from the wise  
You should never take advice from somebody  
That ain't try  
They said I wouldn't make it out alive  
They told me I would never see the rise  
That's why I gotta get 'em every time  
Gotta watch 'em bleed too  
Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathing  
Racing to the moonlight and I'm speeding  
I'm headed to the stars ready to go far  
I'm star walkin'  
Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathing  
Racing to the moonlight and I'm speeding  
I'm headed to the stars ready to go far  
I'm star walkin'  
Been that *ha* since I came out my mama  
Thanking g-d daddy never wore a  
Prove 'em wrong every time til it's normal  
Why worship legends  
When you know that you can join 'em  
These demons don't like me they don't like me  
Likely they wanna fight me  
Come on try it out try me  
They put me down but I never cried out  
Why me words from the wise  
Don't put worth inside somebody  
That ain't try  
They said I wouldn't make it out alive  
They told me I would never see the rise  
That's why I gotta get 'em every time  
Gotta watch 'em bleed too  
Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathing  
Racing to the moonlight and I'm speeding  
I'm headed to the stars ready to go far  
I'm star walkin'  
Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathing  
Racing to the moonlight and I'm speeding  
I'm headed to the stars ready to go far  
I'm star walkin'  
Star walkin'  
Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathing  
Racing to the moonlight and I'm speeding  
I'm headed to the stars ready to go far  
I'm star walkin'
