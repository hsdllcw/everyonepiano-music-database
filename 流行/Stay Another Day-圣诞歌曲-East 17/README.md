### Stay Another Day歌词：

Baby if you've got to go away  
Don't think I can take the pain  
Won't you stay another day  
Oh don't leave me alone like this  
Don't you say it's the final kiss  
Oh won't you stay another day  
Don't you know we've come too far now  
Just to go and try to throw it all away  
Thought I heard you say you love me  
That your love was gonna be here to stay  
I've only just begun to know you  
All I can say is won't you stay just one more day  
Baby if you've got to go away  
Don't think I can take the pain  
Won't you stay another day  
Oh don't leave me alone like this  
Don't you say it's the final kiss  
Oh won't you stay another day  
I touch your face while you are sleeping  
And hold your hand don't understand what's going on  
Good times we had return to haunt me  
Though it's for you all that I do seem to be wrong  
Baby if you've got to go away  
Don't think I can take the pain  
Won't you stay another day  
Oh don't leave me alone like this  
Don't you say it's the final kiss  
Oh won't you stay another day  
Baby if you've got to go away  
Don't think I can take the pain  
Won't you stay another day  
Oh don't leave me alone like this  
Don't you say it's the final kiss  
Oh won't you stay another day  
Baby if you've got to go away  
Don't think I can take the pain  
Won't you stay another day  
Oh don't leave me alone like this  
Don't you say it's the final kiss  
Oh won't you stay another day
