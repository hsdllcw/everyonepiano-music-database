### When I Was Your Man歌词：

Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now  
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same  
When our friends talk about you  
All it does is just tear me down  
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name  
And it all just sounds like uh uh uh  
Hmmm too young too dumb to realize  
That I should have bought you flowers and held your hand  
Should have gave you all my hours when I had the chance  
Take you to every party  
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance  
Now my baby is dancing  
But she's dancing with another man  
My pride my ego my needs and my selfish ways  
'Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life  
Now I'll never never get to clean up the mess I made  
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes  
It all just sounds like uh uh uh uh  
Too young too dumb to realize  
That I should have bought you flowers and held your hand  
Should have gave all my hours when I had the chance  
Take you to every party  
Cause all you wanted to do was dance  
Now my baby is dancing  
But she's dancing with another man  
Although it hurts I'll be the first to say that I was wrong  
Oh I know I'm probably much too late  
To try and apologize for my mistakes  
But I just want you to know  
I hope he buys you flowers I hope he holds your hand  
Give you all his hours when he has the chance  
Take you to every party  
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance  
Do all the things I should have done when I was your man  
Do all the things I should have done when I was your man
