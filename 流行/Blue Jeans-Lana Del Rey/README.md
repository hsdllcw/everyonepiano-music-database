Blue Jeans歌词：

  
Blue jeans, white shirt  
Walked into the room  
You know you make my eyes burn  
  
It was like James Dean for sure  
You're so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer  
  
You were full of punk rock  
I grew up on hip hop  
You fit me better than my favourite sweater  
And I know that love is mean, and love hurts  
But I still remember that day we met in December  
Oh baby  
  
I will love you till the end of time  
I would wait a million years  
Promise you'll remember that you're mine  
Baby can't you see through the tears  
  
Love you more than those bitches before  
Say you'll remember, say you'll remember  
Oh baby who  
I will love you till the end of time  
  
Big dreams  
Gangster  
Said you had to leave to start your life over  
  
I was like, no please, stay here  
We don't need no money, we could make it all work  
  
But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday  
I stay up waiting, anticipating and pacing  
But he was chasing paper  
Caught up in the game  
It was the last I heard  
I will love you till the end of time  
I would wait a million years  
Promise you'll remember that you're mine  
Baby can't you see through the tears  
  
Love you more than those bitches before  
Say you'll remember, (oh baby) say you'll remember  
Oh baby who  
I will love you till the end of time  
  
You went out every night  
And baby that's alright  
I told you that no matter what you did I'd be by your side  
  
Cause I'mma ride or die  
Whether you fail or fly  
Well shit, at least you tried  
  
But when you walked out the door  
A piece of me died  
Told you I wanted more  
That's not what I had in mind  
Just want it like before  
We were dancing all night  
Then they took you away  
Stole you out of my life  
You just need to remember  
  
I will love you till the end of time  
I would wait a million years  
Promise you'll remember that you're mine  
Baby can't you see through the tears  
  
Love you more than those bitches before  
Say you'll remember, (oh baby) say you'll remember  
Oh baby who  
I will love you till the end of time
