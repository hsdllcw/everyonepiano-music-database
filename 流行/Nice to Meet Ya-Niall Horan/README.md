### Nice to Meet Ya歌词：

I like the way you talk I like the things you wear  
I want your number tattooed on my arm in ink I swear  
'Cause when the morning comes I know you won't be there  
Every time I turn around you disappear  
I wanna blow your mind just come with me I swear  
I'm gonna take you somewhere warm you know j'adore la mer  
'Cause when the morning comes I know you won't be there  
Every time I turn around you disappear  
I got love for you  
I got love for you  
Nice to meet ya  
I got love for you  
I got love for you  
Nice to meet ya what's your name  
Let me treat ya to a drink  
I like the way you talk I like the things you wear  
I want your number tattooed on my arm in ink I swear  
'Cause when the morning comes I know you won't be there  
And every time I turn around you disappear  
I got love for you  
I got love for you  
Nice to meet ya  
I got love for you  
I got love for you  
One minute you're there the next one you're gone  
Been waiting for you all night so come on  
You know what I need you know what I want  
You know what I need now  
You know what I need now  
Nice to meet ya what's your name  
Let me treat ya to a drink  
Nice to meet ya  
I got love for you  
Where ya been  
I got love for you  
Let me treat ya  
I got love for you  
To a drink  
I got love for you  
Nice to meet ya
