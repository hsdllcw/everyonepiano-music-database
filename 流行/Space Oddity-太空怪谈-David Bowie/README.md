### Space Oddity歌词：

Ground Control to Major Tom  
Ground Control to Major Tom  
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on  
Ground Control to Major Tom  
Commencing countdown engines on  
Check ignition and may God's love be with you  
This is Ground Control to Major Tom  
You've really made the grade  
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear  
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare  
"This is Major Tom to Ground Control  
I'm stepping through the door  
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way  
And the stars look very different today  
For here  
Am I sitting in a tin can  
Far above the world  
Planet Earth is blue  
And there's nothing I can do  
Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles  
I'm feeling very still  
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go  
Tell my wife I love her very much she knows"  
Ground Control to Major Tom  
Your circuit's dead there's something wrong  
Can you hear me Major Tom  
Can you hear me Major Tom  
Can you hear me Major Tom  
Can you  
"Here am I floating round my tin can  
Far above the Moon  
Planet Earth is blue  
And there's nothing I can do "
