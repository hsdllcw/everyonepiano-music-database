**Ray of Light**
是美国女歌手Madonna的歌曲。收录在其同名专辑中。有人说这是麦当娜最为成功的一张专辑，它使许多讨厌麦当娜“物质女孩”风格的人不得不对麦当娜另眼相看。1998年麦当娜推出《Ray
of
Light》，实验了新的音乐风格，她原本以为反映不会太大，但出人意料的是这张唱片迅速登上了排行榜的首位，并自此共4次荣获白金奖,全球销量两千万张。并且被公认为是电子音乐的巅峰之作。“
_Ray of Light_ ”（光线）在90年代末期改变了Madonna以前流行舞曲的风格，成为了Madonna继“Like a
Prayer”之后销量最大的唱片。 这张专辑揉合了时下流行的电子舞曲元素，如Trip-Hop、Bass等，营造一种科技与未来的迷幻空间。

### Ray of Light歌词：

Zephyr in the sky at night - I wonder  
Do my tears of mourning  
Sink beneath the sun  
She's got herself a universe -Gone quickly  
For the call of thunder  
Threatens everyone  
And I feel  
Like I just got home  
And I feel  
And I feel  
Like I just got home  
And I feel

Faster than the speeding light - She's flying  
Trying to remember  
Where it all began  
She's got herself a little piece of heaven  
Waiting for the time when  
Earth shall be as one  
And I feel  
Like I just got home  
And I feel  
And I feel  
Like I just got home  
And I feel

Quicker than a ray of light  
Quicker than a ray of light  
Quicker than a ray of light

Zephyr in the sky at night - I wonder  
Do my tears of mourning  
Sink beneath the sun  
She's got herself a universe - Gone quickly  
For the call of thunder  
Threatens everyone  
And I feel?

Quicker than a ray of light - Then gone for  
Someone else shall be there?  
Through the endless years

She's got herself a universe  
She's got herself a universe  
She's got herself a universe  
And I feel  
And I feel  
And I feel  
Like I just got home  
And I feel  
Quicker than a ray of light - She's flying  
Quicker than a ray of light - I'm flying
