### Believe歌词：

I believe, I believe, I believe, hey [8x]

Everest is only a mountain  
A pyramid is just a shape  
Doesn't have to hold you back  
Doesn't have to pin you down

Let your dreams take flight  
And your heart ignite

Did you know that it's true  
Everything is possible  
There's nothing we can't do  
It's a wild and beautiful fire  
And I believe in you

I believe, I believe, I believe, hey [4x]  
And I believe in you  
I believe, I believe, I believe, hey [4x]

Don't be afraid to be who you are  
Just scream out and shout and follow the stars  
Forget about the past that it's over  
We are the young ones our way is forward

Who keeps tabs on stupid mistakes?  
We all mess up but that's just the way  
We learn how to get back up  
We learn how to turn the page

So we will let our dreams take flight  
And our hearts ignite

Did you know that it's true  
Everything is possible  
There's nothing we can't do  
It's a wild and beautiful fire  
And I believe in you

I believe, I believe, I believe, hey [4x]  
And I believe in you  
I believe, I believe, I believe, hey [4x]

Let your dreams take flight  
And your heart ignite

Did you know that it's true  
That everything is possible  
There's nothing we can't do  
It's a wild and beautiful fire  
And I believe in you

I believe, I believe, I believe, hey [4x]  
And I believe in you  
I believe, I believe, I believe, hey [4x]  
And I believe in you
