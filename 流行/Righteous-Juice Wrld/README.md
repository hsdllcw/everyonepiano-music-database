**Righteous双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Righteous_ 是美国嘻哈男歌手Juice Wrld的歌曲。记得Juice曾经说过：EMO
RAP并不是无谓的呻吟，而是通过情绪的宣泄让自己与听众变得乐观，为别人正在思考却怯于表达的事情发声。听完此曲，给大家的感觉是告别时的心安，是久违的宁静。而他也将这种祥和体现的淋漓尽致。

### Righteous歌词：

I will  
I will  
I will  
Oh-ooh  
Uh  
All white Gucci suit I'm feeling righteous yeah  
I know that the truth is hard to digest yeah  
Five or six pills in my right hand yeah  
Codeine runneth over on my nightstand  
Takin' medicine to fix all of the damage  
My anxiety the size of a planet  
Yeah ooh  
Holes in my skull over time  
My heart's over ice  
Whoa  
Over ice I'm freezing  
Beautiful eyes deceiving  
We may die this evening  
Coughing wheezing bleeding  
High I'm an anxious soul  
Blood moons are my eyes stay low  
Red and black they glow  
Under attack in my soul  
When it's my time I'll know  
Never seen a hell so cold  
Yeah we'll make it out I'll know  
We'll run right through the flames let's go  
Go  
All white Gucci suit I'm feeling righteous yeah  
I know that the truth is hard to digest yeah  
Five or six pills in my right hand yeah  
Codeine runneth over on my nightstand  
Taking medicine to fix all of the damage  
My anxiety the size of a planet  
Yeah ooh  
Holes in my skull over time  
My heart's over ice  
Whoa uh  
I'm in too deep  
Can't swim like me  
We're drowning so I will see  
My demons ten feet under me  
Inhale exhale but I can't breathe  
Too busy drinking codeine doin' high speeds  
Crash pour a four sip it slow make the time pass  
Take a pill for the thrill have a relapse  
Devil in my head tryna run gym laps  
I ain't tryna race he don't even know me like that  
All white Gucci suit I'm feeling righteous yeah  
I know that the truth is hard to digest yeah  
Five or six pills in my right hand yeah  
Codeine runneth over on my nightstand  
Taking medicine to fix all of the damage  
My anxiety the size of a planet  
Yeah ooh  
Holes in my skull over time  
My heart's over ice  
Whoa  
I will see
