### Alcohol You歌词：

The sun is rising ink  
For me it's hard to blink  
I'm falling  
I wrote some stupid words  
Before I lost my mind  
And called you  
A taste of bittersweet  
To chase the memories  
Blue heaven  
I need you but it hurts  
To feel like I deserve  
Your weapons  
Why do fairy tales fail baby  
Mumbling in the dark to save me  
Love you from the bottom of my...  
Alcohol you when I'm drunk  
I do it 'cause you’re not around  
This pain's the only thing that I can't refuse  
They warned me but I think it's only fake news  
I will, cohol, you  
When I'm drunk  
If you're the enemy  
then maybe I'm too weak to see it  
The fire's in my chest  
But I won't let my head  
Believe it  
If this is just a dream  
Don't wake me in between  
I mean it  
You lied so many times  
But right between the lines  
I read it  
Why do fairy tales fail baby  
Mumbling in the dark to save me  
Love you from the bottom of my…  
Alcohol you when I'm drunk  
I do it 'cause you're not around  
This pain's the only thing that I can't refuse  
They warned me but I think it's only fake news  
I will cohol you when I'm drunk  
I'll cohol you when I'm drunk  
I will call you when I'm.. strong…
