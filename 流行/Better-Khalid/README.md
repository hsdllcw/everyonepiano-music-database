### Better歌词：

Better  
Nothing baby  
Nothing feels better  
I'm not really drunk I never get that f**ked up  
I'm not I'm so sober  
I love to see you shine in the night like the diamond you are  
I love to see you shine in the night like the diamond you are  
On the other side it's alright just hold me in the dark  
On the other side it's alright just hold me in the dark  
No one's got to know what we do hit me up when you're bored  
No one's got to know what we do hit me up when you're bored  
'Cause I live down the street  
So hit me when you need and it's yours  
Our love is  
Nothing feels better than this  
Nothing feels better  
Nothing feels better than this  
Nothing feels better oh no  
We don't gotta hide it this is what you like I'll admit  
Nothing feels better than this  
You say we're just friends but I swear when nobody's around  
You say we're just friends but I swear when nobody's around  
I keep my hand around your neck we connect are you feeling it now  
I keep my hand around your neck  
'Cause I am  
We connect are you feeling it now  
I get so high that I ignite I swear to God feel my feet leave the ground  
I get so high that I ignite  
Ooh yeah  
Your back against the wall this is all we've been talking about  
My ears  
Nothing feels better than this  
Nothing feels better  
Nothing feels better than this  
Nothing feels better oh no  
We don't got to hide it this is what you like I'll admit  
Nothing feels better than this  
Know this if I left  
I'd take you back  
When you say you say like that I ayy  
Know this if I left  
I'd take you back  
When you say you say like  
Nothing feels better than this  
Nothing feels better  
Nothing feels better than this  
Nothing feels better no no  
We don't gotta hide it this is what you like I'll admit  
Nothing feels better than this  
Nothing feels better than this
