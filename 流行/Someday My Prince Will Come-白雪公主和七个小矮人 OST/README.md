### Someday My Prince Will Come歌词：

Some day my prince will come  
Some day we'll meet again  
And away to his castle we'll go  
To be happy forever I know

Some day when spring is here  
We'll find a love anew  
And the birds will sing,  
And wedding bells will ring  
Someday when my dreams come true  
Barbra Streisand's Version  
Some day my prince will come  
Some day I'll find my love  
And how thrilling that moment will be  
When the prince of my dreams comes to me

He'll whisper "I love you"  
And steal a kiss or two  
Though he's far away  
I'll find my love some day  
Some day when my dreams come true

Some day I'll find my love  
Someone to call my own  
And I'll know him the moment we meet  
For my heart will start skipping a beat  
Some day we'll say I do  
Things we've been longing to  
Though he's far away I'll find my love some day  
Some day when my dreams come true

Somewhere waiting for me  
There is someone I'm longing to see  
Someone I simply can't help but adore  
Someone who'll thrill me forever

Someday my prince will come  
Someday I will find the one  
Though he's far away  
He'll find my love someday  
Someday when my dreams come true  
Oh please make my dreams come true  
Tiffany Thornton's Version  
Some day my prince will come  
Some day we'll meet again  
And away to his castle I go,  
To be happy forever I know

Some day when spring is here  
We'll find our love a new  
And the birds will sing and wedding bells ring  
Some day when my dreams come true

(La la la la la la)  
(Some day my prince will come)

Some day my prince will come  
Some day I'll find my love  
How amazing that moment will be  
When the prince of my dreams come to me

Some where he waved to me  
Some one I long to see  
Though he's far away  
I'll find him someday  
Someday when my dreams come true

(La la la la la la)  
Oh oh  
(Some day my prince will come)

Hooaa Ooo Oh woahoh (x4)  
Some day my prince will come

Some day my prince will come  
Some day we'll meet again  
And away to his castle I go (castle I go)  
To be happy forever I know

Some day when spring is here  
We'll find our love a new  
And the birds will sing and wedding bells ring  
Someday (x3)

Though hes far away  
I'll find him someday  
Someday when my dreams come true

(La la la la la la)  
(Some day my prince will come) (prince will come)  
(La la la la la la)  
(Some day my prince will come) (Ooo Oh)  
(La la la la la la)  
(Some day my prince will come) (Ooo Oh)  
(La la la la la la)  
(My prince will come)

Some day my prince will come
