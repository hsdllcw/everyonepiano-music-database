### Die Hard歌词：

Old habits die hard  
Settled down got everything that I need  
Finally found someone who is nice to me  
So why do I always dream of you  
I guess it's hard to face the truth  
I'll have a slight heart  
I can change my mind but not my heart  
I'll have a slight heart  
Can't cover up these lies without a scar  
Is it just the road I'm taking  
But you're the rush the blows I'm chasing  
Old habits die hard  
Hard  
They die hard  
They die hard  
We were young and nobody could touch us  
I had to run got a little too dangerous  
But I'm only halfway over you  
I guess it's hard to face the truth  
Old habits die hard die hard  
I can change my mind but not my heart  
Old habits die hard they die hard  
Can't cover up these lies with my guitar  
Is it just the road I'm taking  
But you're the rush the blows I'm chasing  
Old habits die hard  
Hard they die hard  
They die hard  
They die hard  
Ohhhh  
They die hard  
Old habits die hard  
I can change my mind but not my heart  
Old habits die hard  
Can't cover up these lies with my guitar  
Is it just the road I'm taking  
But you're the rush the blows I'm chasing  
'Cause old habits die hard  
Hard they die hard hard  
They die hard  
They die hard  
Old habits die hard  
Now there's only me and my guitar
