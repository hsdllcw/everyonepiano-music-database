### Unity歌词：

In the dark of night  
The stars light up the sky  
We see them flying free  
That's just like you and me  
Everyone is lonely sometimes  
But I would walk a thousand miles  
To see your eyes  
You are not alone, we are family  
Hold me, let's escape all this reality  
You are my symphony  
By your side, we are Unity  
You are my energy  
My guiding light, we are Unity  
We are Unity  
We are Unity  
Although the rain might pour  
A thunder starts to roar  
The lightning wakes the wave  
But through it, we are brave  
Everyone is lonely sometimes  
But I would walk a thousand miles  
To see your eyes  
You are not alone, we are family  
Hold me, let's escape all this reality  
You are my symphony  
By your side, we are Unity  
You are my energy  
My guiding light, we are Unity  
(We are...) We are Unity  
(We are...) We are Unity  
(My Unity)  
(My Unity)  
(My Unity)  
(My Unity)  
We are Unity  
You are my symphony  
By your side, we are Unity  
You are my energy  
My guiding light, we are Unity  
We are Unity  
We are Unity
