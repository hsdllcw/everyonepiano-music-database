### Foolish Games歌词：

You took your coat off and stood in the rain  
You were always crazy like that  
I watched from my window  
Always felt I was outside looking in on you  
You were always the mysterious one  
with dark eyes and careless hair  
You were fashionably sensitive, but too cool to care  
Then you stood in my doorway with nothing to say  
besides some comment on the weather  
Well in case you failed to notice  
in case you failed to see  
This is my heart bleeding before you  
This is me down on my knees  
These foolish games are tearing me apart  
Your thoughtless words are breaking my heart  
You're breaking my heart  
You were always brilliant in the morning  
Smoking your cigarettes, talking over coffee  
Your philosophies on art, Baroque moved you  
You loved Mozart and you'd speak of your loved ones  
As I clumsily strummed my guitar  
Excuse me, think I've mistaken you for somebody else  
Somebody who gave a damn  
Somebody more like myself  
These foolish games are tearing me apart  
Your thoughtless words are breaking my heart  
You're breaking my heart  
You took your coat off and stood in the rain  
You were always crazy like that
