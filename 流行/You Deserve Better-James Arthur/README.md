### You Deserve Better歌词：

I'm just not sure my heart is working  
And yours is beating double time  
Deep down you know I ain't even worth it  
It's not enough babe all I do is make you cry  
Like ooh woah ooh woah  
I know I do this every time  
Like ooh woah I know  
That I just got to say what's on my mind  
You deserve better better better than me  
Might be what you want but I'm not what you need  
You're better better than you even realize  
You deserve better better better than me  
Might be what you want but I want you to see  
You're better off without me in your life  
And I hope you'll find somebody else  
That'll love you like nobody else  
And I hope he gives you something real oh I love you still  
But you deserve better better better better  
Give up on me 'cause babe I'm hopeless  
The more it hurts the more it's right  
You know I loved I just never showed it  
It'll be too late when you're with some other guy  
Like ooh woah ooh woah  
I know I do this every time  
Like ooh woah I know  
That I just got to say what's on my mind  
You deserve better better better than me  
Might be what you want but I'm not what you need  
You're better better than you even realize  
You deserve better better better than me  
Might be what you want but I want you to see  
You're better off without me in your life  
And I hope you'll find somebody else  
That'll love you like nobody else  
And I hope he gives you something real oh I love you still  
But you deserve better better better better  
Might be what you want but not what you need  
Baby oh yeah  
You deserve better better better than me  
Might be what you want but I'm not what you need  
You're better better than you even realize  
You deserve better better better than me  
Might be what you want but I want you to see  
You're better off without me in your life  
And I hope you'll find somebody else  
That'll love you like nobody else  
And I hope he gives you something real oh I love you still  
But you deserve better better better better
