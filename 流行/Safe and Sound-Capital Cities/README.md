### Safe And Sound歌词：

I could lift you up  
I could show you what you wanna see  
And take you where you wanna be  
You could be my luck  
Even if the sky is falling down  
I know that we'll be safe and sound  
We're safe and sound  
I could fill your cup  
You know my river won't evaporate  
This world we still appreciate  
You could be my luck  
Even in a hurricane of frowns  
I know that we'll be safe and sound  
Safe and sound  
We're safe and sound  
Safe and sound  
We're safe and sound  
Hold your ground  
We're safe and sound  
Safe and sound  
I could show you love  
In a tidal wave of mystery  
You'll still be standing next to me  
You could be my luck  
Even if we're six feet underground  
I know that we'll be safe and sound  
We're safe and sound  
Safe and sound  
Safe and sound  
Hold your ground  
Safe and sound  
I could lift you up  
I could show you what you wanna see  
And take you where you wanna be  
You could be my luck  
Even if the sky is falling down  
I know that we'll be safe and sound  
I could lift you up  
I could show you what you wanna see  
And take you where you wanna be  
You could be my luck  
Even if the sky is falling down  
I know that we'll be safe and sound  
We're safe and sound  
We're safe and sound  
We're safe and sound  
We're safe and sound  
Safe and sound  
We're safe and sound  
Safe and sound  
We're safe and sound  
Hold your ground  
We're safe and sound  
Safe and sound  
We're safe and sound
