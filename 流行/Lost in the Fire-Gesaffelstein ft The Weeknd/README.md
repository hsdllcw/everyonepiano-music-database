《 **Lost in the Fire** 》是由Mike Levy、Abel "The Weeknd" Tesfaye、Ahmad
Balshe、Jason "Daheala" Quenneville、Nate Donmoyer作词、作曲，Gesaffelstein、The
Weeknd演唱的歌曲，于2019年1月11日发行。

这是继上次《Hurt You》后Gesaffelstein与The Weeknd的又一次的合作。这次的曲风还是延续了The
Weeknd的一贯风格，不过总有种是《Pray For Me》和《Hurt You》混在了一起的感觉。

Weeknd.html "Hawái-Hawaii")》曲谱下载

### Lost in the Fire歌词：

I wanna f**k you slow with the lights on  
Lights on lights on lights on  
You're the only one I've got my sights on  
Sights on sights on sights on  
Type of sex you could never put a price on  
Price on price on price on  
I'll take it off you're the one I'll roll the dice on  
Dice on dice on dice on  
And I just want a baby with the right one  
I just want a baby with the right  
Because I could never be the one to hide one  
I could never be the one to hide  
And we lost a lot of things in the fire  
So it took a year for me to find out  
Find out find out  
I can't lose you babe

You said you're going through a phase

Keepin' your heart safe

Well baby you can bring a friend

She can ride on top your face  
Top your face  
While I f**k you straight  
While I f**k you straight yeah  
And we lost a lot of things in the fire  
Fire  
So it took a year for me to find out
