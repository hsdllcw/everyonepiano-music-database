### Cupid's Curse歌词：

[Kehlani:]  
I ain't never seen you before  
Where'd you come from?  
I ain't never met you  
Lookin' back we were one  
Now I don't understand you  
Showin' up, ain't enough  
You say it's love, yeah-yeah  
Bet you don't wanna be here  
Driving 'round town in my new Jeep  
Runnin' too deep like there was your keys  
I don't got the time to be on my knees, just to beg you please  
Wonder when you gon' sleep  
Riding 'round town with your new flame, she a cute thing  
She ain't nothin' like me  
Always tryna play but this ain't a game  
And once I'm gone, baby what you gon' say?  
Why? (Why? Why?)  
You never been the type to compromise  
Why? (Why? Why?)  
Whoever you're lookin' for, I wish you'll find (You'll find)  
I'm low on self-control, I'll lose this fight  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
I ain't never seen you before  
Where'd you come from?  
I ain't never met you  
Lookin' back we were one  
Now I can't fuckin' stand you  
Showin' up, ain't enough  
You say it's love, yeah-yeah  
Bet you don't wanna be here  
I ain't never seen you before  
Where'd you come from?  
I ain't never met you (Oh, oh)  
Lookin' back we were one  
Now I can't fuckin' stand you  
Showin' up, ain't enough  
You say it's love, yeah-yeah  
Bet you don't wanna be here  
[Phora:]  
Yeah  
I've been riding 'round town with a new girl but it still feel like it's just
us two (Just us two)  
Shit don't really feel like we used to but I'm prideful, yeah I'm just like
you  
I, need you and I want you and it's hard to admit but I still love you  
I wanna start fresh, wanna trust you, wanna love you the way that you need me
to (Te way that you need me to)  
But I've been (I've been, I've been)  
Pushin' you aside, at the same time checkin' if you callin' (Callin',
callin'), oh  
You'll never learn to fly if you're too afraid of fallin' (Fallin', fallin'),
no  
Life's too short, let's roll the dice, I'm all in now (I'm all in now)  
I'm all in now (I'm all in now)  
You were right there  
I was lonely on the ground, you were right there  
Went from bein' in my dreams to my nightmares  
I've been trapped in my thoughts so long, I can't find love  
You know what it's like, yeah (You know what it's like, yeah)  
Late nights, you stay on my mind, yeah (Stay on my mind, yeah)  
Yeah we fight, break up  
Then we fuck, make up  
Hit your phone like, "I need you tonight, yeah" (I need you tonight, yeah)  
But I  
I've never been the type to compromise, why? (Why?)  
You should come through tonight, girl lose your pride (Pride)  
Whoever you're lookin' for, I hope you'll find  
I hope you'll find  
[Kehlani & Phora:]  
'Cause I ain't never seen you before  
Where'd you come from?  
I ain't never met you  
Lookin' back we were one  
Now I can't fuckin' stand you  
Showin' up, ain't enough  
You say it's love, yeah-yeah  
Bet you don't wanna be here  
I ain't never seen you before  
Where'd you come from?  
I ain't never met you  
Lookin' back we were one  
Now I can't fuckin' stand you  
Showin' up, ain't enough  
You say it's love, yeah-yeah  
Bet you don't wanna be here
