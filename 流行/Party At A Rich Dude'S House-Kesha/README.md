### Party At A Rich Dude'S House歌词：

Swimming pool, limousine, come on let's do it  
Come on let's cause a scene, come on let's do it  
Cigar in the caviar, come on let's do it  
I'm pissing in the don create, come on let's do it  
Now, come on let's do it, we're gonna do it, now  
Come on let's do it, we're gonna do this

Whoa oh, there's a party at a rich dude's house  
Whoa oh, there's a party at a rich dude's house  
If you wanna go, then you know oh  
We're gonna fight 'till we do it right  
So let's whoa oh, tonight

No we're not on the list, come on let's do it  
No we don't give a shit, come on let's do it  
Dance 'till your pants come off, come on get naked  
Party 'till the break of dawn, come let's do it  
Now, come on let's do it, come on, come on

Whoa oh, there's a party at a rich dude's house  
Whoa oh, there's a party at a rich dude's house  
If you wanna go, then you know oh  
We're gonna fight 'till we do it right  
So let's whoa oh, tonight

I wake up in the front yard, we don't care  
Wine stain on the sofa, we don't care  
I threw up in the closet and I don't care  
Cause we're young and we're broke  
And I can't find my coat  
And the sun is coming up  
And oh my god I think I'm still drunk  
(Where's my coat? Where?)

There's a party at a rich dude's house  
There's a party at a rich dude's house  
Whoa oh, there's a party at a rich dude's house  
Whoa oh, there's a party at a rich dude's house  
If you wanna go, then you know oh  
We're gonna fight 'till we do it right  
So let's whoa oh, tonight
