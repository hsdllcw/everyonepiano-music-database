By the Grace of God歌词：

  

Was 27 surviving my return of Saturn  
A long vacation didn’t sound so bad  
Was full of secrets locked up tight like iron mountain  
Running on empty so out of gas

Thought I wasn’t enough  
Found I wasn’t so tough  
Layin’ on the bathroom floor  
We were living on a fault line  
And I felt the fault was all mine  
Couldn’t take it anymore

By the grace of God (there was no other way)  
I picked myself back up (I knew I had to stay)  
I put one foot in front of the other  
And I looked in the mirror and decided to stay  
Wasn’t gonna let love take me out that way

I thank my sister for keeping my head above the water  
When the truth was like swallowing sand  
Now every morning, there is no more mourning  
Oh, I can finally see myself again

I know I am enough  
Possible to be loved  
It was not about me  
Now I have to rise above  
Let the universe call the bluff  
Yeah, the truth’ll set you free

By the grace of God (there was no other way)  
I picked myself back up (I knew I had to stay)  
I put one foot in front of the other  
And I looked in the mirror and decided to stay  
Wasn’t gonna let love take me out, oh, that way,  
No, that way, no  
Not in the name of love  
In the name of love  
That way, no,  
That way, no  
I am not giving up

By the grace of God  
I picked myself back up  
I put one foot in front of the other  
And I looked in the mirror (looked in the mirror)  
Looked in the mirror (looked in the mirror)

By the grace of God (there was no other way)  
I picked myself back up (I knew I had to stay)  
I put one foot in front of the other  
And I looked in the mirror and decided to stay  
Wasn’t gonna let love take me out that way
