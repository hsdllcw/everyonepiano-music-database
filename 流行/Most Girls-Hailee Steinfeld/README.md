### Most Girls歌词：

Some girls feel best in their tiny dresses  
Some girls in nothin' but sweatpants, looking like a princess  
Some girls kiss new lips every single night  
They're stayin' out late cause they're just celebrating life  
You know some days you feel so good in your own skin  
But it's okay if you wanna change the body that you came in  
Cause you look greatest when you feel like a damn queen  
We're all just playing a game in a way, tryna win that life  
Most girls are smart and strong and beautiful  
Most girls work hard, go far, we are unstoppable  
Most girls, our fight to make every day  
No two are the same  
I wanna be like, I wanna be like most girls  
I wanna be like, I wanna be like most girls  
I wanna be like, I wanna be like  
I wanna be like, I wanna be like  
I wanna be like, I wanna be like  
Some girls like to keep their physique real private  
Some girls wear jeans so tight 'cause it feels so right, yeah  
Some girls, every day searching, keep the page turning  
Sleepin' in late cause they're just celebrating life  
You know some days you feel so good in your own skin  
But it's okay if you wanna change the body that you came in  
Cause you look greatest when you feel like a damn queen  
We're all just playing a game in a way trying to win that life  
Most girls are smart and strong and beautiful  
Most girls work hard, go far, we are unstoppable  
Most girls, our fight to make every day  
No two are the same  
I wanna be like, I wanna be like most girls  
I wanna be like, I wanna be like most girls  
I wanna be like, I wanna be like  
I wanna be like, I wanna be like  
I wanna be like, I wanna be like  
Most girls, yeah  
Most girls  
Wanna be, wanna be, wanna be  
Most girls, our fight to make every day  
No two are the same  
I wanna be like most girls  
I wanna be like, I wanna be like most girls  
I wanna be like, I wanna be like  
I wanna be like, I wanna be like  
I wanna be like
