### I Hate U, I Love U 歌词：

[Verse 1: Olivia O'Brien]  
Feeling used, but I'm still missing you  
And I can't see the end of this  
Just wanna feel your kiss against my lips  
And now all this time is passing by  
But I still can't seem to tell you why  
It hurts me every time I see you  
Realize how much I need you

[Hook: Olivia O'Brien]  
I hate you, I love you  
I hate that I love you  
Don't want to, but I can't put  
Nobody else above you  
I hate you, I love you  
I hate that I want you  
You want her, you need her  
And I'll never be her

[Verse 2: gnash]  
I miss you when I can't sleep  
Or right after coffee or right when I can't eat  
I miss you in my front seat  
Still got sand in my sweaters  
From nights we don't remember  
Do you miss me like I miss you?  
Fucked around and got attached to you  
Friends can break your heart too  
And I'm always tired but never of you  
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit  
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit  
I type a text, but then I nevermind that shit  
I got these feelings, but you never mind that shit  
Oh oh, keep it on the low  
You're still in love with me, but your friends don't know  
If you wanted me, you would just say so  
And if I were you, I would never let me go  
I don't mean no harm, I just miss you on my arm  
Wedding bells were just alarms  
Caution tape around my heart  
You ever wonder what we could have been?  
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did  
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix  
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed  
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing  
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance  
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing  
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings  
When love and trust are gone  
I guess this is moving on  
Everyone I do right does me wrong  
So every lonely night, I sing this song

[Hook: Olivia O'Brien and gnash]  
I hate you, I love you  
I hate that I love you  
Don't want to, but I can't put  
Nobody else above you  
I hate you, I love you  
I hate that I want you  
You want her, you need her  
And I'll never be her

[Bridge: Olivia O' Brien and gnash]  
All alone, I watch you watch her  
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen  
You don't care, you never did  
You don't give a damn about me  
Yeah, all alone, I watch you watch her  
She is the only thing you've ever seen  
How is it you never notice  
That you are slowly killing me

[Hook: Olivia O'Brien]  
I hate you, I love you  
I hate that I love you  
Don't want to, but I can't put  
Nobody else above you  
I hate you, I love you  
I hate that I want you  
You want her, you need her  
And I'll never be her
