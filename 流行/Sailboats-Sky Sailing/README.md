### Sailboats歌词：

Sailboats wish that they were stars  
Floating softly in the sky  
Among our dreams that bid goodbye  
Moving through transparent space  
Drifting through the stratosphere  
And onward 'till they disappear  
These continents from overhead  
Look like tiny paper shapes  
Intricately set in place  
Below the misty mountain clouds  
There's a lovely silver bay  
Where sunset sailors often hide away  
Scooba diver in the lock  
Speedboat driver in the dock  
Sailplane pilot in the blue take me up there with you  
The world looks brighter from this high altitude  
I was walking through the trees  
wish that they were  
And I was swimming through the sees  
they don't know who they  
I was falling through the air  
When it hit me right there  
My eyes are tired  
I don't even care  
An airplane carred me to bed  
Where I slept above the coast  
And dreamt I had become a ghost  
I sail above the frozen peaks  
Deep in cold cathedral caves  
Across the hills and far beyond the waves  
Take the car on the run  
Fly the jet to the sun  
And bring the spacecraft in soon  
While I play chess with the moon  
I feel like sleeping through this cold afternoon  
Once in 1964  
they wish that were  
An actress ran on the shore  
they don't know who they  
And though you'll never return  
I love you Audrey Hepburn  
Sometimes I can see your face in the crowd  
There are sailboats throughout this brilliant sky  
But you cannot pick them out if you can't fly  
I'm glad the Earth doesn't care If I go up there  
If you want to just ask me and I'll take you along
