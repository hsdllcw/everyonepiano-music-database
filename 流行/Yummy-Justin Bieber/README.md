### Yummy歌词：

Yeah you got that yummy-yum  
That yummy-yum that yummy-yummy  
Yeah you got that yummy-yum  
That yummy-yum that yummy-yummy  
Say the word on my way  
Yeah babe yeah babe yeah babe  
Any night any day  
Say the word on my way  
Yeah babe yeah babe yeah babe  
In the mornin' or the late  
Say the word on my way  
Bonafide stallion  
Ain't in no stable no you stay on the run  
Ain't on the side you're number one  
Yeah every time I come around you get it done  
You get it done  
Fifty-fifty love the way you split it  
Hundred racks help me spend it babe  
Light a match get litty babe  
That jet set watch the sunset kinda of yeah yeah  
Rollin' eyes back in my head make my toes curl yeah yeah  
Yeah you got that yummy-yum  
That yummy-yum that yummy-yummy  
Yeah you got that yummy-yum  
That yummy-yum that yummy-yummy  
Say the word on my way  
Yeah babe yeah babe yeah babe  
Any night any day  
Say the word on my way  
Yeah babe yeah babe yeah babe  
In the mornin' or late  
Say the word on my way  
Standing up keep me on a rise  
Lost control of myself I'm compromised  
You're incriminated no disguise  
No disguise  
And you ain't never running low on supplies  
Fifty-fifty love the way you split it  
Hundred racks help me spend it babe  
Light a match get litty babe  
That jet set watch the sunset kinda of yeah yeah  
Rollin' eyes back in my head make my toes curl yeah yeah  
Yeah you got that yummy-yum  
That yummy-yum that yummy-yummy  
You stay flexin' on me  
You stay flexin' on me  
Yeah you got that yummy-yum  
Yeah yeah  
That yummy-yum that yummy-yummy  
Say the word on my way  
Yeah babe yeah babe yeah babe  
Yeah babe  
Any night any day  
Say the word on my way  
Yeah babe yeah babe yeah babe  
Yeah babe  
In the mornin' or late  
Say the word on my way  
Hop in the Lambo' I'm on my way  
Drew House slippers on with a smile on my face  
I'm elated that you are my lady  
You got the yum yum yum yum  
You got the yum yum-yum woah
