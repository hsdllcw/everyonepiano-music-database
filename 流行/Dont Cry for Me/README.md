### Don't Cry for Me歌词：

Jason Derulo  
Too young too fast  
Thought I was ready but my time is batched yeah  
One life too much to see  
And I said "Hey I had better days"  
Yeah I miss that train by a mile away  
But please don't cry for me  
If you thought I was down if you thought I was losing sleep  
Well I'm still goin' hard in this week  
I can hold my breath when it gets too hard to breathe  
Breathe  
Every lonely night and teardrops into sea  
So don't cry for me  
Don't cry for me don't cry for me  
No no please don't cry please don't cry for me  
Don't cry for me  
Bad luck bad love  
I can't let her go it was never enough no  
I'll bite my tongue  
I'd say nowhere was wrong  
Somebody told me somebody told me I was done  
I'm still picking up the pieces and now I was number one  
If you thought I was down if you thought I was losing sleep  
Well I'm still goin' hard in this week  
I can hold my breath when it gets too hard to breathe  
Breathe  
Every lonely night and teardrops into sea  
Oh so don't cry for me  
Don't cry for me don't cry for me  
Oh  
No no please don't cry please don't cry for me  
If you thought I was down if you thought I was losing sleep  
Well I'm still goin' hard in this week  
I can hold my breath when it gets too hard to breathe  
Every lonely night and teardrops into sea  
Oh so don't cry for me  
Don't cry oh  
Don't cry for me don't cry for me  
Don't cry  
No no please don't cry please don't cry for me  
Don't cry for me
