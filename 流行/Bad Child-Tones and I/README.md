### Bad Child歌词：

My family always said I was the bad child  
Throwing me away into the bad pile  
All my life been putting on a fake smile  
Sitting on my own feel like I'm exiled  
Feeling like I always do the wrong things  
Telling all the friends that I'm the bad kid  
Now I'm on my own I lost my magic  
Dealing with your bulls**t now I'm over it  
And you took apart of me  
Left me with the memories oh  
We were never a family  
Now you're standing in front of my door oh oh oh  
Like none of this happened at all all all all  
I guess I'm always gonna be the bad child  
I guess I'm always gonna be the mad child  
Cause you will never understand my weird mind  
My weird mind  
And to every single person here that doubts me  
Telling me that they could live without me  
Cause they will never understand my weird mind  
My weird mind  
I've never really been the one to reach out  
Acting like my life was squeaky clean now  
Like everything I do is just a let down  
Feeling like I always do the wrong things  
Telling all the friends that I'm the bad kid  
Now I'm on my own I lost my magic  
Dealing with your bulls**t now I'm over it  
And you took apart of me  
Left me with the memories oh  
We were never a family  
Now you're standing in front of my door oh oh oh  
Like none of this happened at all all all all  
I guess I'm always gonna be the bad child  
I guess I'm always gonna be the mad child  
Cause you will never understand my weird mind  
My weird mind  
And to every single person here that doubts me  
Telling me that they could live without me  
Cause they will never understand my weird mind  
My weird mind  
They say I've lost my mind  
They say I'll never find it  
I think they kinda right  
In fact I kinda like it  
They say I've lost my mind  
They say I'll never find it  
I think they kinda right  
I guess I'm always gonna be the bad child  
I guess I'm always gonna be the mad child  
Cause you will never understand my weird mind  
My weird mind  
And to every single person here that doubts me  
Telling me that they could live without me  
Cause they will never understand my weird mind  
My weird mind oh  
My family always said I was the bad child
