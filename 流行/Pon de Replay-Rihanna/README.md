### Pon de Replay歌词：

[Hook x2:]

All the gyal pon the dancefloor wantin some more what  
Come Mr. DJ won't you turn the music up

[Verse:]

lets go dip it low then you bring it up slow  
wind it up 1 time wind it back once more

[Pre-Hook:]  
Run, Run, Run, Run  
Everybody move run  
Lemme see you move and  
Rock it til the grooves done  
Shake it til the moon becomes the sun (Sun)  
Everybody in the club give me a run (Run)  
If you ready to move say it (Yeah Yeah)
