### Someone New歌词：

Don't take this the wrong way,  
You knew who I was with every step that I ran to you,  
Only blue or black days,  
Electing strange perfections in any stranger I choose.

Would things be easier if there was a right way?  
Honey, there is no right way.

And so I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone
new  
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new  
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new  
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new

There's an art to life's distractions,  
To somehow escape the burning weight, the art of scraping through,  
Some like to imagine,  
The dark caress of someone else, I guess any thrill will do

Would things be easier if there was a right way?  
Honey, there is no right way.

And so I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone
new  
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new  
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new  
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new

I wake at the first cringe of morning,  
And my heart's already sinned.  
How pure, how sweet a love, Aretha, that you would pray for him.

'Cause God knows I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit every day with
someone new  
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new  
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new  
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new  
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new  
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day

Love with every stranger, the stranger the better  
Love with every stranger, the stranger the better  
Love with every stranger, the stranger the better  
Love with every stranger, the stranger the better  
Love with every stranger, the stranger the better  
Love with every stranger, the stranger the better

I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new  
[Repeat 'til end]
