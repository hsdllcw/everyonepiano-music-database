### What Am I歌词：

I met her on a Monday evening  
She was standing outside of the park and ride  
And I said hey ma where you been  
Been looking for woman like you for all my life  
And she said hola talk to me before I have to leave  
And one day we could be  
Maybe more than two lost souls just passing by  
Jonah Marais：  
Knew I was falling when I looked inside your eyes  
She said I know you are but what am I  
Daniel Seavey：  
Tell me have you seen a sunset  
Turn into a sunrise  
Kiss right through the night  
'Cause we should try that sometime  
Hold you 'til the mornin'  
And if I said I'm fallin' would you just reply  
I know you are but what am I  
Zach Herron/Corbyn Besson：  
Ah-ooh ah-ooh  
What am I  
Ah-ooh  
What am I  
Ah-ooh  
Zach Herron：  
Open the door to my apartment when you get it  
Kissin' on my neck and throw my jacket to the side  
I know your heart is beating quick  
And if you put your head on my chest hear the same in mine yeah  
And we'll be making love  
Until the sun comes up  
But one day maybe I  
I could put a ring on your finger before you change your mind yeah  
Jonah Marais：  
Knew I was falling when I looked inside your eyes  
She said I know you are but what am I  
Daniel Seavey：  
Tell me have you seen a sunset  
Turn into a sunrise  
Kiss right through the night  
'Cause we should try that sometime  
Hold you 'til the mornin'  
And if I said I'm fallin' would you just reply  
I know you are but what am I  
Corbyn Besson/Jack Avery：

What am I  
Ah-ooh  
Jack Avery/Zach Herron：  
Tell me have you seen a sunset  
Turn into a sunrise  
Kiss right through the night  
'Cause we should try that sometime  
Hold you 'til the mornin'  
And if I said I'm fallin' would you just reply  
I know you are but what am I  
Daniel Seavey/Zach Herron/Corbyn Besson：  
Tell me have you seen a sunset  
Turn into a sunrise  
Kiss right through the night  
'Cause we should try that sometime  
Hold you 'til the mornin'  
Hold you 'til the mornin'  
If I said I'm fallin' would you just reply  
I know you are but what am I
