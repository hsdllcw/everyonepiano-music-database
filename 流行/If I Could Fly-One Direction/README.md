### If I Could Fly歌词：

[Harry:]  
If I could fly, I'd be coming right back home to you  
I think I might give up everything, just ask me to

[Liam:]  
Pay attention, I hope that you listen cause I let my guard down  
Right now I'm completely defenseless

[Harry:]  
For your eyes only, I show you my heart  
For when you're lonely and forget who you are  
I'm missing half of me when we're apart  
Now you know me, for your eyes only  
For your eyes only

[Louis:]  
I've got scars, even though they can't always be seen  
And pain gets hard, but now you're here and I don't feel a thing

[Niall:]  
Pay attention, I hope that you listen cause I let my guard down  
Right now I'm completely defenseless

[Harry, Liam, Louis, Niall:]  
For your eyes only, I show you my heart  
For when you're lonely and forget who you are  
I'm missing half of me when we're apart  
Now you know me, for your eyes only  
For your eyes only

[Louis (Liam):]  
I can feel your heart inside of mine  
(I feel it, I feel it)  
I've been going out of my mind  
(I feel it I feel it)  
Know that I'm just wasting time  
And I

[Harry:]  
Hope that you don't run from me

[Louis:]  
For your eyes only, I show you my heart  
[Harry:]  
For when you're lonely and forget who you are  
I'm missing half of me when we're apart  
Now you know me, for your eyes only

[Niall, Harry, Louis, Liam:]  
For your eyes only, I show you my heart  
For when you're lonely and forget who you are  
I'm missing half of me when we're apart  
Now you know me, for your eyes only  
For your eyes only  
For your eyes only
