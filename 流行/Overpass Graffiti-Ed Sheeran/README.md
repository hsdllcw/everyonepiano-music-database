### Overpass Graffiti歌词：

This is a dark parade  
Another rough patch to rain on to rain on  
I know your friends may say  
This is a cause for celebration  
Hip hip hooray love  
Photographs in sepia tones  
So still the fire is barely fighting the cold alone  
There are times when I can feel your ghost  
Just when I'm almost letting you go  
The cards were stacked against us both  
I will always love you for what it's worth  
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass  
I know time may change the way your think of us  
But I'll remember the way we were  
You were the first full stop love that will never leave  
And baby you will never be lost on me  
This is a god d**n shame  
I never wanted to break it  
And leave us tainted  
Know I should walk away  
But I just can't replace us  
Or even erase us  
The car was stuck the engine stalled  
Both of us got caught out in the snow alone  
There were times when I forget the lows  
And think the highs were all that we'd ever know  
The cards were stacked against us both  
I will always love you for what it's worth  
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass  
I know time may change the way your think of us  
But I'll remember the way we were  
You were the first full stop love that will never leave  
And baby you will never be lost on me  
Lost on me  
Baby you will never be lost on me  
Lost on me  
I will always love you for what it's worth  
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass  
I know time may change the way your think of us  
But I'll remember the way we were  
You were the first full stop love that will never leave  
And baby you will never be lost on me  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Lost on me  
Graffiti on the overpass
