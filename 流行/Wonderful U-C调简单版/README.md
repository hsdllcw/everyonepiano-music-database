《 **Wonderful U**
》来自AGA于2016年发布的第二张大碟《Ginadoll》。江海迦的声音总能打动人心，她把伤心或快乐都放在了音乐里，融汇在了歌声里，用动人的歌声来讲述不同的情感故事。

同时，这首歌是粤语歌《圆》的英文版。有人说；“从喜欢你开始，我就像个圆规，一直转啊转。我以为你总会发现我为你画的这块圆，可是，最终我是把自己绕进了这个小圆圈，而你，越走越远。以后，再也不要喜欢你了，反正，我总会回到原点。”
就像歌词“But I know that it's wonderful, Incredible, Baby
irrational”，是的，到后来的我们，穿过很多风景，遇到更多人事，无论主人公是你的过客还是归人，当时挺美好就行。

### Wonderful U歌词：

I never knew  
When the clock stopped and I'm looking at you  
I never thought I'll miss someone like you  
Someone I thought that I knew  
I never knew  
I should have known something wouldn't be true  
Baby you know that I'm so into you  
More than I know I should do  
So why why why  
Why should we waited  
And I I I  
I should be waiting  
Waiting for someone new  
Even though that it wasn't you  
But I know that it's  
Wonderful  
Incredible  
Baby irrational  
I never knew it was obsessional  
And I never knew it was with you oooh  
Baby if it's just  
Wonderful  
Incredible  
Baby irrational  
I never knew it was so sad  
Just so sad  
I'm so sorry  
Even now I just cannot feel you feel me  
Hmmm  
Hmmm  
So why why why  
Why should we waited  
And I I I  
I should be waiting  
Waiting for someone new  
Even though that it wasn't you  
But I know that it's  
Wonderful  
Incredible  
Baby irrational  
I never knew it was obsessional  
And I never knew it was with you oooh  
Baby if it's just  
Wonderful  
Incredible  
Baby irrational  
I never knew it was so sad  
Just so sad  
I'm so sorry  
Even now I just cannot feel you fall  
I don't even know now  
I'm sure you'll wait for me  
Even now I just cannot deny  
I just hold on so tight  
Until you and I never could breathe  
Oh  
Wonderful  
Incredible  
Baby irrational  
I never knew it was obsessional  
And I never knew it was with you until you tell me to  
Baby if it's just  
Wonderful  
Incredible  
Baby irrational  
I never knew it was so sad  
Just so sad  
I'm so sorry  
Even now I just cannot feel you feel me
