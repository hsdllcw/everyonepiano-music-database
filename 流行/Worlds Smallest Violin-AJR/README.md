### World's Smallest Violin歌词：

My grandpa fought in World War II  
He was such a noble dude  
I can't even finish school  
Missed my mom and left too soon  
His dad was a fireman  
Who fought fires so violent  
I think I bored my therapist  
While playing him my violin  
Oh my God  
That's so insane  
Oh my God  
That's such a shame  
Next to them my **** don't feel so grand  
But I can't help myself from feeling bad  
I kinda feel like two things can be sad  
The world's smallest violin  
Really needs an audience  
So if I do not find somebody soon  
That's right that's right  
I'll blow up into smithereens  
And spew my tiny symphony  
Just let me play my violin for you you you you  
My grandpa fought in World War II  
He was such a noble dude  
Man I feel like such a fool  
I got so much left to prove  
All my friends have vaping friends  
They're so good at making friends  
I'm so scared of caving in  
Is that entertaining yet  
Oh my God  
That's so insane  
Oh my God  
That's such a shame  
Next to them my **** don't feel so grand  
But I can't help myself from feeling bad  
I kinda feel like two things can be sad  
The world's smallest violin  
Really needs an audience  
So if I do not find somebody soon  
That's right that's right  
I'll blow up into smithereens  
And spew my tiny symphony  
Just let me play my violin for you you you you  
Somewhere in the universe  
Somewhere someone's got it worse  
Wish that made it easier  
Wish I didn't feel the hurt  
The world's smallest violin  
Really needs an audience  
So if I do not find somebody soon  
I'll blow up into smithereens  
And spew my tiny symphony  
All up and down a city street  
While tryna put my mind at ease  
Like finishing this melody  
This feels like a necessity  
So this could be the death of me  
Or maybe just a better me  
Now come in with the timpanis  
And take a shot of Hennessy  
I know I'm not there mentally  
But you could be the remedy  
So let me play my violin for you
