**The Way It Is** 是美国著名歌手，钢琴演奏家以及词曲作家Bruce Hornsby的歌曲。

  
以流畅的钢琴弹奏见长起家的Bruce Hornsby自八十年代中期以接连的畅销单曲“ _The Way It Is_ ”、“Mandolin
Rain”及“The Valley
Road”而获得1986年葛莱美奖最佳新人大赏以来，便是美国流行民谣、乡村乐界竞相邀请的对象之一，尤其他在九十年代转跨“唱而优则制”的多重专业领域，让他在同时发展个人的歌唱事业外，亦为不少的歌手制作出相当好评的专辑。

  
Hornsby与他的伴奏乐队The
Range在早期的风格较偏向抒情民谣的弹唱性格，在当时还燃起一阵新民谣风格的推广，加之Hornsby唱腔清雅却又同时带着充沛的情感，使得他立刻成为美国相当期许的新生代歌手。但尽管事业卓然有成，Hornsby却并不以此为满足而继续开发新的融合风格。

  
九十年代开始，接连的几张专辑均企图结合了热力四射的融合爵士的即兴演奏，除此他还曾应邀与迷幻传奇名团Grateful
Dead齐同演出，如此荣耀使得他的声誉又再度更上层楼。

### The Way It Is歌词：

Standing in line, marking time  
Waiting for the welfare dime  
'Cause they can't buy a job  
The man in the silk suit hurries by  
As he catches the poor old lady's eyes  
Just for fun he says, "Get a job."

That's just the way it is  
Some things will never change  
That's just the way it is  
Ah, but don't you believe them

Said hey, little boy, you can't go where the others go  
'Cause you don't look like they do  
Said hey, old man, how can you stand to think that way?  
And did you really think about it before you made the rules?  
He said, son

That's just the way it is  
Some things will never change  
That's just the way it is  
Ah, but don't you believe them, yeah

That's just the way it is  
That's just the way it is

Well, they passed a law in '64  
To give those who ain't got a little more  
But it only goes so far  
'Cause the law don't change another's mind  
When all it sees at the hiring time  
Is the line on the color bar, no

That's just the way it is  
Some things will never change  
That's just the way it is  
That's just the way it is, it is, it is, it is
