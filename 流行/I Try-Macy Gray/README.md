### I Try歌词：

Games, changes, and fears  
When will they go from here?  
When will they stop?  
I believe that fate has brought us here  
And we should be together, babe,  
But we're not

I play it off, but I'm dreaming of you  
I'll keep my cool, but I'm fiendin.

I try to say goodbye and I choke  
I try to walk away and I stumble  
Though I try to hide it, it's clear  
My world crumbles when you are not near  
Goodbye and I choke  
I try to walk away and I stumble  
Though I try to hide it, it's clear  
My world crumbles when you are not near

I may appear to be free,  
But I'm just a prisoner of your love  
I may seem alright and smile when you leave,  
But my smiles are just a front, just a front

I play it off, but I'm dreaming of you  
I'll keep my cool, but I'm fiendin

I try to say goodbye and I choke  
I try to walk away and I stumble  
Though I try to hide it, it's clear  
My world crumbles when you are not near  
Goodbye and I choke  
I try to walk away and I stumble  
Though I try to hide it, it's clear  
My world crumbles when you are not near

Here is my confession  
May I be your possession  
Boy, I need your touch,  
Your love kisses, and such  
With all my might I try,  
But this I can't deny, deny

I play it off, but I'm dreaming of you  
I'll keep my cool, but I'm fiendin

I try to say goodbye and I choke  
I try to walk away and I stumble  
Though I try to hide it, it's clear  
My world crumbles when you are not near  
Goodbye and I choke  
I try to walk away and I stumble  
Though I try to hide it, it's clear  
My world crumbles when you are not near

Goodbye and I choke  
I try to walk away and I stumble  
Though I try to hide it, it's clear  
My world crumbles when you are not near
