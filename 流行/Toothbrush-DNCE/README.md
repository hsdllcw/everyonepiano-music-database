### Toothbrush歌词：

Baby you don't have to rush  
You can leave a toothbrush  
At my place  
At my place  
We don't need to keep it hush  
You can leave a toothbrush  
At my place  
At my place  
Stuck in a limbo  
Half hypnotized  
Each time I let you stay the night stay the night  
Up in the morning  
Tangled in sheets  
We play the moment on repeat  
on repeat  
When you're standing there in your underwear  
And my t-shirt from the night before  
With your messed up hair  
And your feet still bare  
Would you mind closing the bedroom door  
Baby you don't have to rush  
You can leave a toothbrush  
At my place  
At my place  
We don't need to keep it hush  
You can leave a toothbrush  
At my place  
At my place  
Cause I just I just can't let you go  
Give me something I never know  
So baby you don't have to rush  
You can leave a toothbrush  
At my place  
At my place  
No need to question next time we meet  
I know you're coming home with me home with me  
Sweat like a sauna  
Break out the ice  
I know you're gonna stay the night stay the night  
When you're standing there in your underwear  
And my t-shirt from the night before  
With your messed up hair  
And your feet still bare  
Would you mind closing the bedroom door  
Baby you don't have to rush  
You can leave a toothbrush  
At my place  
At my place  
We don't need to keep it hush  
You can leave a toothbrush  
At my place  
At my place  
Cause I just I just can't let you go  
Give me something I never know  
So baby you don't have to rush  
You can leave a toothbrush  
At my place  
At my place  
I don't want this to end  
And there's no need to play pretend  
If you stay with me again  
Would you mind closing the bedroom door  
Baby you don't have to rush  
You can leave a toothbrush  
At my place  
At my place  
We don't need to keep it hush  
You can leave a toothbrush  
At my place  
At my place  
Cause I just I just can't let you go  
Give me something I never know  
So baby you don't have to rush  
You can leave a toothbrush  
At my place  
At my place
