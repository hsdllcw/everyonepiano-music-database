### Cigarette Daydreams歌词：

Did you stand there all alone  
Oh I cannot explain what's going down  
I can see you standing next to me  
In and out somewhere else right now  
You sigh look away  
I can see it clear as day  
Close your eyes so afraid  
Hide behind that baby face  
You can drive all night  
Looking for the answers in the pouring rain  
You wanna find peace of mind  
Looking for the answer  
Funny how it seems like yesterday  
As I recall you were looking out of place  
Gathered up your things and slipped away  
No time at all I followed you into the hall  
Cigarette Daydream  
You were only seventeen  
Soft speak with a mean streak  
Nearly brought me to my knees  
You can drive all night  
Looking for the answers in the pouring rain  
You wanna find peace of mind  
Looking for the answer  
If we could find a reason a reason to change  
Looking for the answer  
If you can find a reason a reason to say  
Standing in the pouring rain  
You can drive all night  
Looking for the answers in the pouring rain  
You wanna find peace of mind  
Looking for the answer  
If we could find a reason a reason to change  
Looking for the answer  
If you can find a reason a reason to say  
Standing in the pouring rain
