Up All Night歌词：

  

It feels like we've been living in fast forward

Another moment passing by

(U-U-Up all night)

The party's ending but it's now or never

Nobody's going home tonight

(U-U-Up all night)

[HARRY]

Katy Perry's on replay

She's on replay

DJ got the floor to shake

The floor to shake

People going all the way

Yeah all the way

I'm still wide awake

[All]

I wanna stay up all night

And jump around until we see the sun

I wanna stay up all night

And find a girl and tell her she's the one

Hold on to the feeling

And don't let go

Cause we got the flow now

Get out of control

I wanna stay up all night

And do it all with you

U-U-Up all night

Like this all night(Hey!)

Up all night

Like this all night(Hey!)

Up all night

[ZAYN]

Don't even care about the table breaking

We only wanna have a laugh

(U-U-Up all night)

I'm only thinking about this girl I'm seeing

I hope she'll wanna kiss me back

(U-U-Up all night)

[HARRY]

Katy Perry's on replay

She's on replay

DJ got the floor to shake

The floor to shake

People going all the way

Yeah all the way

I'm still wide awake

[All]

I wanna stay up all night

And jump around until we see the Sun

I wanna stay up all night

And find a girl and tell her she's the one

Hold on to the feeling

And don't let go

Cause we got the flow now

Get out of control

I wanna stay up all night

And do it all with you

U-U-Up all night

Like this all night(Hey!)

Up all night

Like this all night(Hey!)

Up al night

[HARRY]

Katy Perry's on replay

She's on replay

(We're gonna want to stay up all night)

DJ got the floor to shake

The floor to shake

(We're gonna want to stay up all night)

Up all night,up all night

(We're gonna want to stay up all night)

[All]

I wanna stay up all night

And jump around until we see the Sun

I wanna stay up all night

And find a girl and tell her she's the one（she's the one)

Hold on to the feeling

And don't let go

Cause we got the flow now

Get out of control(Get out of control)

I wanna stay up all night

And do it all with you(do it all with you）

U-U-Up all night

Like this all night(Hey!)

Up all night

Like this all night(Hey!)

Up all night
