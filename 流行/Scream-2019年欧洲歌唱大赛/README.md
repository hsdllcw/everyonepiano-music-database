### Scream歌词：

No I can't stay here longer  
You cannot make me cry  
So I will leave you to wonder  
What will become of our lives  
I'll swallow hard fall apart  
Break and bleed but you won't see  
Tears won't fall  
While pride stands tall  
Maybe they can't be heard or seen  
But tears aren't quiet things  
They scream  
They scream  
They scream  
Though my throat is on fire  
My eyes will be liars  
And they'll try to stay drier  
Until you turn away  
I'll swallow hard fall apart  
Break and bleed but you won't see  
Tears will fall I hear them all  
They scream  
Scream they scream  
They scream oh oh  
Not so silent and innocent  
Acid rain from your fingerprints  
Echoes rivers of loneliness  
Hitting the walls of my heart  
They scream  
Not so silent and innocent  
Acid rain from your fingerprints  
They scream  
Echoes rivers of loneliness  
Hitting the walls of my heart
