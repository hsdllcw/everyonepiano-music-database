### Running歌词：

You you turned gold to dust now  
What was trust is lost now  
What is all this darkness you have inside  
I just can't ignore it  
From my heart what's pouring  
'Cause this hurt I can no longer hide  
Baby it's the last time  
It's the last time I'm 'bout it 'bout it  
Check it with a flashlight  
It's the last night you'll get up on it  
If you wanna save it ooh  
Better shoot straight like a laser ooh  
I ain't waiting for you you  
Now I'm running for my life  
Been too many miles  
Tryna find the road to you  
'Cause you you just wanna drive  
With no place in mind  
Where the hell we going to oh  
I'm running running  
Got me running running ooh  
I'm running running  
Got me running running ooh  
Barrel love a gun pow  
I'll be on the run now  
Can't take no more bullets through my wounds  
I just can't ignore it  
From my heart what's pouring  
'Cause this hurt I can no longer hide  
Baby it's the last time  
It's the last time I'm 'bout it 'bout it  
Check it with a flashlight  
It's the last night you'll get up on it  
If you wanna save it ooh  
Better shoot straight like a laser ooh  
I ain't waiting for you you  
Now I'm running for my life  
Been too many miles  
Tryna find the road to you  
'Cause you you just wanna drive  
With no place in mind  
Where the hell we going to oh  
I'm running running  
Got me running running ooh  
I'm running running  
Got me running running ooh  
I'm running running  
Got me running running ooh  
I'm running running  
Got me running running ooh  
So watch it blow  
When I let it go  
When I cut this rope and run run  
By the time you wake  
It'll be too late  
Now the bullet's left the gun yeah  
Now I'm running for my life  
Been too many miles  
Tryna find the road to you  
'Cause you you just wanna drive  
With no place in mind  
Where the hell we going to oh  
I'm running running  
Got me running running ooh  
I'm running running  
Got me running running ooh  
I'm running running  
Got me running running ooh  
I'm running running  
Got me running running ooh
