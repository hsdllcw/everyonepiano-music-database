### On Chill歌词：

We've been on a tragedy for months  
Why can't you agree with me for once  
Maybe we can be on chill tonight  
Maybe I can give you chills too  
We've been on a tragedy for months  
Why can't you agree with me for once yeah  
Maybe we can be on chill tonight one time  
Maybe I can give you chills too chill  
I'm gettin' mine like fine wine measured in time  
Many other brothers loved you but this pleasure is mine  
It's no pressure for us to say that  
I love you for now  
So f**k that cuffin' s**t  
I just want us be comfortable now for real  
Who you lovin'  
Who you wanna pull up with  
Who don't care you datin' long as  
You care and you trust him  
Tryna hear all your problems so  
I can lighten the load  
No you're not fighting alone  
'Cause I'm protectin' you from 'em so chill  
Life hard and ex lovers is like scars  
'Cause they stop hurtin' but never forgettin' what it was  
I was a youngin' my biggest enemy was the club  
Voicemails on third rings f**ked me up so I don't trust  
We've been on a tragedy for months  
Why can't you agree with me for once Tryin' slow up  
Maybe we can be on chill tonight  
Maybe I can give you chills too  
We've been on a tragedy for months months  
Why can't you agree with me for once yeah  
Maybe we can be on chill tonight  
Maybe I can give you chills too aye shawty look  
Okay they switch up on you I'm gonna stay the same  
I pull up on you then put it in with patience  
I'm good where we got it without no expectations  
What good is a tidal when shawty been the wave yeah  
Let me illustrate ya  
Let my tongue re-paint ya  
It's already wet have you had a brain storm  
Er'where a n***a take you just know that my face good  
Modify your energy so your bank and your skin glow  
Max field let it fly

Just to show you I don't care go  
Wear it to that n***a house  
We don't share our whereabouts or the gossip the hood love  
Just supreme confidence if we good that's good enough whoa yeah
