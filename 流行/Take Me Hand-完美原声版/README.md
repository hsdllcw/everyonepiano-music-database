### Take Me Hand歌词：

In my dreams  
I feel your light  
I feel love is born again  
Fireflies  
In the moonlight  
Rising stars  
Remember  
The day  
I fell in love with you  
Darling won't you break  
My heart  
Take my hand now  
Stay close to me  
Be my lover  
Won't you let me go  
Close your eyes now  
And you will see  
There's a rainbow  
For you and me  
As I wake up  
I see your face  
I feel love is born again  
Cherry blossom  
Flying birds  
In the sky  
Can't you see  
The sun  
That is shining on the fields  
Is it shining in  
Your heart  
Take my hand now  
Stay close to me  
Be my lover  
Won't you let me go  
Close your eyes now  
And you will see  
There's a rainbow  
For you and me  
And I dream of you  
Every night  
Cause's there only you  
In my mind  
Will you be  
A stranger or a friend in my life  
Darling won't you break  
My heart  
Take my hand now  
Stay close to me  
Be my lover  
Won't you let me go  
Close your eyes now  
And you will see  
There's a rainbow  
For you and me  
Take my hand now  
Stay close to me  
Be my lover  
Won't you let me go  
Close your eyes now  
And you will see  
There's a rainbow  
For you and me  
Take my hand now  
Stay close to me  
Be my lover  
Won't you let me go  
Close your eyes now  
And you will see  
There's a rainbow  
For you and me
