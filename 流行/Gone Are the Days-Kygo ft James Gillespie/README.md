### Gone Are the Days歌词：

You were my closest friend  
My strength when days go mad  
But I spent my time and shallow sheets  
I should've seen your hand  
I didn't see the signs  
I was blinded by the lights  
And lost where I belong  
I thought that we grow old  
Give kids all bad advice  
Now I'm alone  
You went and left me with these sleepless nights  
You took my warmth and soul left me with doubt and cold  
Is this where I belong  
Gone are the days of young  
Better run for cover  
There's no one here to save you from yourself  
When you discover it's hard  
You don't know how to carry on  
Gone are the days have of young  
Better run for cover  
When everything you love is lying six feet under I know  
You don't know how but you carry on  
These days are longer now  
My nights spent wondering why  
And I get mad inside  
Did you fight back or even try  
You didn't see the signs  
Were blinded by the lights  
You lost where you came from  
We're not so different no  
We grew up wanting more  
But I found it easy 'cause I left my morals at the door  
You took an honest turn  
I watched you fall apart  
You lost before you started  
Gone are the days of young  
Better run for cover  
There's no one here to save you from yourself  
When you'll discover it's hard  
You don't know how to carry on  
Gone are the days of young  
Better run for cover  
When everything you love is lying six feet under I know  
You don't know how but you carry on  
On  
Gone are the days of young  
Better run for cover  
There's no one here to save you from yourself  
When you'll discover it's hard  
You don't know how to carry on
