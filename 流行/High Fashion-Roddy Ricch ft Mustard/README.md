### High Fashion歌词：

Mustard on the beat ho  
Shawty made that a*s clap she don't need no applause  
High fashion like Goyard  
G-Wagen or the Rover  
I put some ice on you 'cause you got a cold heart  
I know I gotta keep my shawty on go go go  
Drop that a*s to the floor-floor yeah  
Ahh woah  
You ain't gotta deal with none of these n***as no more  
If we hop in the Benz is that okay  
Is it okay if I call you my Prada bae  
I ain't no player I just got a lot of baes  
But let me tell you I like you a lot bae  
I wanna start at the top and the bottom bae  
Know you want the shoe with the red at the bottom bae  
You know I like when you ride at the top bae  
She want Chane'-ne' and Dio'-o'  
I'm only doin' cash out I don't need promo  
I pull up to the high rise I'm in the four-four  
Inside cocoa  
If I got a feeling I keep it inside my heart  
And I keep a Patek too 'cause I don't do facades  
You see my diamonds even when I'm in the dark  
And since you got it it make you go and do anything you want to  
Shawty made that a*s clap she don't need no applause  
No applause  
High fashion like Goyard  
Like Goyard  
G-Wagen or the Rover  
Skrrt  
I put some ice on you 'cause you got a cold heart  
Ooh-ooh  
I know I gotta keep my shawty on go go go  
Shawty on go go yeah  
Drop that a*s to the floor-floor yeah  
Ahh woah  
You ain't gotta deal with none of these n***as no more  
If we hop in the Benz is that okay  
Is it okay if I call you my Prada bae  
I ain't no player I just got a lot of baes  
But let me tell you I like you a lot bae  
I wanna start at the top and the bottom bae  
Know you want the shoe with the red at the bottom bae  
You know I like when you ride at the top bae  
If I hit it from the back she gon' hit the sidewalk  
If she got a best friend with her take her back to my loft  
Got her five in the mornin' wildin' wildin'  
And her name ain't Megan but she a stallion stallion  
Never keep my h*es divided 'member I was pullin' up in the valley  
And you know I take her soul when she ridin'  
Sweater and her sneakers all Kenzo  
Shawty know to drop it low like a limbo every time  
We kick it like Timbo woah woah woah  
Shawty made that a*s clap she don't need no applause  
Nah nah  
I put some ice on you 'cause you got a cold heart  
Ooh-ooh  
I know I gotta keep my shawty on go go go  
Yeah  
Drop that a*s to the floor-floor yeah  
Shawty made that a*s clap she don't need no applause  
High fashion like Goyard  
G-Wagen or the Rover  
I put some ice on you 'cause you got a cold heart  
I know I gotta keep my shawty on go go go  
Drop that a*s to the floor-floor yeah  
Ahh woah  
You ain't gotta deal with none of these n***as no more  
If we hop in the Benz is that okay  
Is it okay if I call you my Prada bae  
I ain't no player I just got a lot of baes  
But let me tell you I like you a lot bae  
I wanna start at the top and the bottom bae  
Know you want the shoe with the red at the bottom bae  
You know I like when you ride at the top bae
