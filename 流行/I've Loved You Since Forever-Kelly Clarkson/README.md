Kelly
Clarkson在比赛过程中总演绎别人的歌。她的声音被人拿来和惠特妮•休斯顿、玛丽亚•凯莉作比较。虽然歌声风格多变，充满灵性，打动了亿万电视观众的心，但多少掩盖了一个事实：在唱功背后，她还是天赋甚好的原创音乐人。

因为你-凯莉-克莱森.html "Because Of You")》的曲谱下载

### I've Loved You Since Forever歌词：

Before birds flew over rainbows  
And monkeys swung on trees  
There was you and there was me  
Before the sun set in the sky  
And honey came from bees  
There was you and there was me  
Before the moon lit up the night  
And elephants wandered free  
There was you and there was me  
Before otters swam together  
And rivers reached the sea  
There was you and there was me  
Waiting for the day our paths would cross  
And you and I turned into we  
Oh I've loved you since forever  
And forever's how long you'll be loved by me
