### Know Your Worth歌词：

He keeps leaving you for dead  
I don't know what you been waiting for  
So you've got your love locked up instead  
But somethin' better's waitin' at your door  
You don't know your worth  
All the things I know that you deserve  
Say it's not real if it doesn't hurt  
Find someone you know will put you first  
Find someone who loves you at your worst  
Gotta keep gotta keep gotta keep your head up  
Gotta keep gotta keep gotta keep your head up  
Gotta keep gotta keep gotta keep your head up  
Who puts you first?  
Find someone who loves you at your worst  
Don't forget the words I said  
Picking you up when you're feelin' down  
You get strung on thoughts left in your head  
When you lose hope soon you will be found  
You don't know your worth  
All the things I know that you deserve  
Say it's not real if it doesn't hurt  
Find someone you know will put you first  
Find someone who loves you at your worst  
Gotta keep gotta keep gotta keep your head up  
Gotta keep gotta keep gotta keep your head up  
Gotta keep gotta keep gotta keep your head up  
Who puts you first?  
Find someone who loves you at your worst  
Find someone who loves you at your worst  
Find someone who loves you at your worst  
Gotta keep gotta keep gotta keep your head up head  
Gotta keep gotta keep gotta keep your head up  
Keep your head up keep your head up  
Gotta keep gotta keep gotta keep your head up  
Who puts you first?  
Find someone who loves you at your worst  
Find someone who loves you at your worst  
Find someone who loves you at your worst
