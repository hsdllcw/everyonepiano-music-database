### Dying in LA歌词：

The moment you arrived  
They built you up  
The sun was in your eyes  
You couldn't believe it  
Riches all around  
You're walking  
Stars are on the ground  
You start to believe it  
Every face along the boulevard  
Is a dreamer just like you  
You looked at death in a tarot card  
And you saw what you had to do  
But nobody knows you now  
When you're dying in LA  
And nobody owes you now  
When you're dying in LA  
When you're dying in LA  
When you're dying in LA  
The power  
The power  
The power  
Oh the power  
The power  
The power  
Of LA  
Nights at the chateau  
Trapped in your sunset bungalow  
You couldn't escape it  
Yeah  
Drink of paradise  
They told you  
Put your blood on ice  
You're not gonna make it  
Every face along the boulevard  
Is a dreamer just like you  
You looked at death in a tarot card  
And you saw what you had to do  
But nobody knows you now  
When you're dying in LA  
And nobody owes you now  
When you're dying in LA  
When you're dying in LA  
When you're dying in LA  
The power the power  
The power  
Oh the power  
The power  
The power  
Of LA
