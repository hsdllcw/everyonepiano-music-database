### I Guess I'm in Love歌词：

Oh I'm obsessed  
With the way your head is laying on my chest  
How you love the things I hate about myself  
And no one knows but with you I see hope again  
Oh I'm a mess  
When I overthink the little things in my head  
You seem to always help me catch my breath  
But then I lose it again when I look at you that's the end  
And why do I get so nervous when I look into your eyes  
Butterflies can't stop me falling for you  
And darling this is more than anything I felt before  
You're everything that I want but I didn't think I'd find  
Someone who is worth the wait of all the years of my heartbreak  
But I know now I found the one I love  
And I love the way  
You can never find the right things to say  
And you can't sit still an hour in the day  
I'm so in love let's run away because us is enough  
And why do I get so nervous when I look into your eyes  
And butterflies can't stop me falling for you  
And darling this is more than anything I felt before  
You're everything that I want but I didn't think I'd find  
Someone who is worth the wait of all the years of my heartbreak  
But I know now I found the one  
Come close let me be home for anything  
Good or bad I know it's worth it  
And darling this is more than anything I felt before  
You're everything that I want but I didn't think I'd find  
Someone who is worth the wait of all the years of my heartbreak  
But I know now I found the one I love
