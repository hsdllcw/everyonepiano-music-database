### Dancing Feet歌词：

Spin you 'round like chandelier  
Head over heels like tears for fears  
Your love no I can't get enough uh  
Losing my cool but I'm stayin' alive  
Dancin' on rain just to kiss the night  
Your touch oh it feels like a love  
Don't need drama  
I just need one word to get to you  
So tell me now do you want it  
'Cause these dancing feet don't cry to the rhythm they cry for you  
And every Saturday night that you ain't here my tears are blue  
And these blinding lights they shine so bright like we're on the moon  
But I don't wanna dance another beat no unless it's with you  
Dancing feet feet feet  
Dancing feet feet feet  
Unless it's with you with you hey  
But I don't wanna dance  
I don't wanna dance another beat no  
Unless it's with you  
Tell me who do I call when I lose my mind  
Four in the morning and I'm on fire  
It's you that I'm running to  
You got a diamond heart you're a work of art  
And nothing compares when I'm in your arms  
No one 'cause they'll never know oh-oh  
Don't need drama  
I just need one word to get to you  
So tell me now do you want it  
'Cause these dancing feet don't cry to the rhythm they cry for you  
And every Saturday night that you ain't here my tears are blue  
And these blinding lights they shine so bright like we're on the moon  
But I don't wanna dance another beat no unless it's with you  
Dancing feet feet feet  
Dancing feet feet feet  
Unless it's with you with you hey  
But I don't wanna dance  
I don't wanna dance another beat no  
Unless it's with you  
Da-da-da-dancin' feet  
Da-da-da-dancin' feet  
Da-da-da-dancin' feet  
They cry they cry  
Da-da-da-dancin' feet  
Da-da-da-dancin' feet  
Da-da-da-dancin' feet  
They cry they  
'Cause these dancing feet don't cry to the rhythm they cry for you  
And every Saturday night that you ain't here my tears are blue  
And these blinding lights they shine so bright like we're on the moon  
But I don't wanna dance another beat no unless it's with you  
Dancing feet feet feet  
Dancing feet feet feet  
Unless it's with you with you hey  
But I don't wanna dance  
I don't wanna dance another beat no  
Unless it's with you  
Da-da-da-dancin' feet  
Da-da-da-dancin' feet  
Da-da-da-dancin' feet  
They cry they cry  
Da-da-da-dancin' feet  
Da-da-da-dancin' feet  
I don't wanna dance another beat no  
Unless it's with you
