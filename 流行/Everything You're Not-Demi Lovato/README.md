### Everything You're Not歌词：

I've been bruised and I've been broken  
Can't believe that I have put up with all this pain  
I've been used and I was choking on the promise  
I would never fall again

I used to sing to your twisted symphony  
The words that had me trapped inside your misery  
But now I know  
The reason why I couldn't breathe

'Cause all I want is everything you're not  
So go ahead and slam the door  
'Cause you can't shut me out  
And no I don't, I don't care what you say  
'Cause all I really, all I really want  
Is everything you're not

Never gonna break my heart again  
Everything you're not  
Never gonna see your face again  
Never wanna feel this way again

Your darkness was my weakness but it turns out  
That it only went so deep, deep  
A meaningless diversion that is all that you  
Ever meant to me

And I am done with your twisted symphony  
The words that had me sound like stolen poetry  
I tore the pages and I can finally breathe

'Cause all I want is everything you're not  
So go ahead and slam the door  
'Cause you can't shut me out  
And no I don't, I don't care what you say  
'Cause all I really, all I really want  
Is everything you're not

Never gonna break my heart again  
Never gonna see your face again

I want a gentlemen who treats me like a queen  
I need respect, I need love  
Nothing in between  
I will not spell it out for you if you can't see  
'Cause you're not worthy, you don't deserve me  
And now I'm gone

Everything you're not, not, not  
Everything you're not, not, not

'Cause all I want is everything you're not  
So go ahead and slam the door  
'Cause you can't shut me out  
And no I don't, I don't care what you say  
'Cause all I really, all I really want  
Is everything you're not

Never gonna break my heart again  
Never gonna see your face again  
Never wanna feel this way again
