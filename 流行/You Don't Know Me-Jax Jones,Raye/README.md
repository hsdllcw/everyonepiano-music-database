### You Don't Know Me歌词：

Ooh, na na yeah  
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah  
I am not your homie, not your, hoo, na na yeah  
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah  
You don't know me

Oh yeah, time is money so don't fuck with mine  
See I'm out with my girls, I'm a have a good time  
Step back with your chit-chat, killin' my vibe

See, I can't get too much of a good thing  
S'why me a dressed up in the finest things  
Well, please hold your tongue, oh, don't say a damn thing  
See your iPhone camera flashin'  
Please step back, it's my style you're crampin'  
"You here for long?" Oh no, I'm just passin'  
"Do you wanna drink?" No, thanks for askin'

Ooh, na na yeah  
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah  
I am not your homie, not your, hoo, na na yeah  
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah  
You don't know me, fuck yeah  
Ooh, na na yeah  
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah  
I am not your homie, not your, hoo, na na yeah  
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah  
You don't know me, fuck yeah

I mean, we could throw shapes together  
But it doesn't mean you're in my circle, yeah  
Cruise through life and I'm feelin' on track  
If you can't keep up, then you better fall back  
'Cause money look better when I see it all stacked up

See, I can't get too much of a good thing  
S'why me a dressed up in the finest things  
Well, please hold your tongue, oh, don't say a damn thing  
See your iPhone camera flashin'  
Please step back, it's my style you're crampin'  
"You here for long?" Oh no, I'm just passin'  
"Do you wanna drink?" No, thanks for askin'

Ooh, na na yeah  
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah  
I am not your homie, not your, hoo, na na yeah  
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah  
You don't know me, fuck yeah  
Ooh, na na yeah  
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah  
I am not your homie, not your, hoo, na na yeah  
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah  
You don't know me, fuck yeah

Do it just slow down  
Won't get what you want, what you want, what you want, want  
Tell you what you don't know  
I get what I want, what I want, what I want, want

See your iPhone camera flashin'  
Please step back, it's my style you're crampin'  
"You here for long?" Oh no, I'm just passin'  
"Do you wanna drink?" No, thanks for askin'

Ooh, na na yeah  
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah  
I am not your homie, not your, hoo, na na yeah  
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah  
You don't know me, fuck yeah

You don't know me, fuck yeah
