### All the Good Girls Go to Hell歌词：

My Lucifer is lonely  
Standing there killing time  
Can't commit to anything but a crime  
Peter's on vacation an open invitation  
Animals evidence  
Pearly Gates look more like a picket fence  
Once you get inside 'em  
Got friends but can't invite them  
Hills burn in California  
My turn to ignore ya  
Don't say I didn't warn ya  
All the good girls go to Hell  
'Cause even God herself has enemies  
And once the water starts to rise  
And Heaven's out of sight  
She'll want the Devil on her team  
My Lucifer is lonely  
Look at you needing me  
You know I'm not your friend without some greenery  
Walk in wearin' fetters  
Peter should know better  
Your cover up is caving in  
Man is such a fool why are we saving him  
Poisoning themselves now  
Begging for our help wow  
Hills burn in California  
My turn to ignore ya  
Don't say I didn't warn ya  
All the good girls go to Hell  
'Cause even God herself has enemies  
And once the water starts to rise  
And Heaven's out of sight  
She'll want the Devil on her team  
My Lucifer is lonely  
There's nothing left to save now  
My god is gonna owe me  
There's nothing left to save now  
I cannot do the snowflake
