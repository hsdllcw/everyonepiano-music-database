意大利摇滚天团Måneskin联合说唱金属乐队Rage Against the Machine的吉他手Tom
Morello于2023年1月13日献上最新单曲《 **Gossip** 》。

重金属配合的节奏感，听起来就非常带劲，密集的鼓声让头脑一下子清醒过来，很喜欢他们酣畅淋漓摇滚的旋律下向大家表述着一些现世的真实。

### Gossip歌词：

Welcome to the city of lies  
Where everything's got a price  
It's gonna be your new favorite place  
You can be a movie star  
And get everything you want  
Just put some plastic on your face  
This place is a circus you just see the surface  
They cover **** under the rug  
You can't see they're faking they'll never be naked  
Just fill your drink with tonic gin this is the American dream so  
Sip the gossip drink 'til you choke  
Sip the gossip burn down your throat  
You're not iconic you are just like them all  
Don't act like you don't know so  
Sip the gossip drink 'til you choke  
Sip the gossip burn down your throat  
You're not iconic you are just like them all  
Don't act like you don't know oh  
Keep drinking and acting cool  
Don't care if your day is blue  
Nobody loves a gloomy face just  
Take your pills and dance all night  
Don't think at all that's the advice  
So c'mon let's try it's just a taste  
This place is a circus you just see the surface  
They cover **** under the rug  
You can't see they're faking they'll never be naked  
Just fill your drink with tonic gin this is the American dream so  
Sip the gossip drink 'til you choke  
Sip the gossip burn down your throat  
You're not iconic you are just like them all  
Don't act like you don't know so  
Sip the gossip drink 'til you choke  
Sip the gossip burn down your throat  
You're not iconic you are just like them all  
Don't act like you don't know oh  
So sip the gossip drink 'til you choke  
Sip the gossip burn down your throat  
You're not iconic you are just like them all  
Don't act like you don't know oh
