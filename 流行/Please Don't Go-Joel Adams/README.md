### Please Don't Go歌词：

Nobody ever knows  
Nobody ever sees  
I left my soul  
Back then no I'm too weak  
Most nights I pray for you to come home  
Praying to the lord  
Praying for my soul  
Now please don't go  
Most nights I hardly sleep when I'm alone  
Now please don't go oh no  
I think of you whenever I'm alone  
So please don't go  
Cause I don't ever wanna know  
Don't ever want to see things change  
Cause when I'm living on my own  
I wanna take it back and start again  
Most nights I pray for you to come home  
I'm praying to the lord  
I'm praying for my soul  
Now please don't go  
Most nights I hardly sleep  
When I'm alone  
Now please don't go oh no  
I think of you whenever I'm alone  
So please don't go  
I sent so many messages  
You don't reply  
Gotta feel around what am I missing babe  
Singing now oh oh oh  
I need you now I need your love oh  
Now please don't go  
I said most nights I hardly sleep  
When I'm alone  
Now please don't go oh no  
I think of you whenever I'm alone  
So please don't go  
So please don't go  
So please don't go  
Oh no  
I think of you whenever I'm alone  
So please don't go
