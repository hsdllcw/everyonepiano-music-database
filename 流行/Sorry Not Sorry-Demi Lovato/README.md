### Sorry Not Sorry歌词：

Payback is a bad bitch  
And baby I'm the baddest I'm the baddest I'm the baddest  
Now I'm out here looking like revenge  
Feelin' like a ten the best I've ever been  
And yeah I know how bad it must hurt  
To see me like this but it gets worse wait a minute  
Now you're out here looking like regret  
Ain't too proud to beg second chance you'll never get  
And yeah I know how bad it must hurt to see me like this  
But it gets worse wait a minute  
Now payback is a bad bitch  
And baby I'm the baddest  
You f**kin' with a savage  
Can't have this can't have this ah  
And it'd be nice of me to take it easy on ya but nah  
Baby I'm sorry I'm not sorry  
Baby I'm sorry I'm not sorry  
Being so bad got me feelin' so good  
Showing you up like I knew that I would  
Baby I'm sorry I'm not sorry  
Baby I'm sorry I'm not sorry  
Feeling inspired 'cause the tables have turned  
Yeah I'm on fire and I know that it burns  
Baby fineness is the way to kill  
Tell me how it feel bet it's such a bitter pill  
And yeah I know you thought you had bigger better things  
Bet right now this stings wait a minute  
'Cause the grass is greener under me  
Brightness Technicolor I can tell that you can see  
And yeah I know how bad it must hurt to see me like this  
But it gets worse wait a minute  
Now payback is a bad bitch  
And baby I'm the baddest  
You f**kin' with a savage  
Can't have this can't have this ah  
And it'd be nice of me to take it easy on ya but nah  
Baby I'm sorry I'm not sorry  
Baby I'm sorry I'm not sorry  
Being so bad got me feelin' so good  
Showing you up like I knew that I would  
Baby I'm sorry I'm not sorry  
Baby I'm sorry I'm not sorry  
Feeling inspired 'cause the tables have turned  
Yeah I'm on fire and I know that it burns  
Talk that talk baby  
Better walk better walk that walk baby  
If you talk if you talk that talk baby  
Better walk better walk that walk baby  
Oh yeah talk that talk baby  
Better walk better walk that walk baby  
If you talk if you talk that talk baby  
Better walk better walk that walk baby  
Baby I'm sorry I'm not sorry  
Baby I'm sorry I'm not sorry  
Being so bad got me feelin' so good  
Showing you up like I knew that I would  
Baby I'm sorry I'm not sorry  
Baby I'm sorry I'm not sorry  
Feeling inspired 'cause the tables have turned  
Yeah I'm on fire and I know that it burns  
Payback is a bad bitch  
And baby I'm the baddest  
I'm the baddest I'm the baddest
