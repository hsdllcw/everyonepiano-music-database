**Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall**
是Coldplay的歌曲，歌词简直是“神的孩子都跳舞”的最佳注解，整个篇章都和以往的作品一样，充满了非常容易被理解的宏大诗意。诸如“And all the
kids they dance，all the kids all night，until Monday morning feels another
life”（所有的孩子都在跳舞，跳一整晚，直到周一的早晨感知到新的生命）这样的字句统统表达着关于时代和理想的明喻和暗喻。在歌词里，他们把自己比喻成“夹缝中的一代”，还把这一代的眼泪比成瀑布，最终用“高举旗帜”点题，秉承了Coldplay一贯的歌词含义走向：在这个轻飘的时代，宁愿用反叛的方式继续承重的理想，那真是相当的励志

_Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall_
此曲与之前作品风格有较大不同，更多的电子气息和更少的Britpop及摇滚元素为年底发行的新专辑做了铺垫。

### Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall歌词：

I turn the music up, I got my records on  
I shut the world outside until the lights come on  
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone  
I feel my heart stop beating to my favorite song

And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night  
Until Monday morning feels another life  
I turn the music up  
I'm on a roll this time  
And heaven is in sight

I turn the music up, I got my records on  
From underneath the rubble sing a rebel song  
Don't want to see another generation drop  
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop

Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees  
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes  
But my heart is beating and my pulses start  
Cathedrals in my heart

As we saw oh this light I swear you'll,  
Emerge blinking into to tell me it's alright  
As we soar walls, every siren is a symphony  
And every tear's a waterfall  
Is a waterfall  
Ah  
Is a waterfall  
Ah ah ah  
Is a is a waterfall  
Every tear  
Is a waterfall  
Ah ah ah

So you can hurt, hurt me bad  
But still I'll raise the flag

It was a wa wa wa wa wa-terfall  
A wa wa wa wa wa-terfall

Every tear  
Every tear  
Every teardrop is a waterfall

Every tear  
Every tear  
Every teardrop is a waterfall

Every tear  
Every tear  
Every teardrop is a waterfall

Every tear  
Every tear  
Every teardrop is a waterfall

Every tear  
Every tear  
Every teardrop is a waterfall
