### Torn歌词：

You you take all of the li-li-light away  
But but then you give me fireworks  
I I think of leaving ni-ni-night and day  
But but then you always find the words  
You're contagious baby  
Love when you love me hate me  
The way you rock ro-ro-rock my body lately  
You set the rain on fire  
I wish the lows were higher  
Wish I could stop stop stop to save me  
Oh I wanna stay wanna walk out the door  
Oh no right now baby I'm torn  
I can't get enough can't take anymore  
Oh no right now baby I'm torn  
You dry my tears and make it pour  
You show me love and give me war  
I can't get enough can't take anymore  
Oh no right now baby I'm torn  
I I always want to run run run away  
But but then I crawl into your arms  
It it's like we're starting drama every day  
But but you know that's my favorite part  
You're contagious baby  
Love when you love me hate me  
The way you rock ro-ro-rock my body lately  
You set the rain on fire  
I wish the lows were higher  
Wish I could stop stop stop to save me  
Oh I wanna stay wanna walk out the door  
Oh no right now baby I'm torn  
I can't get enough can't take anymore  
Oh no right now baby I'm torn  
You dry my tears and make it pour  
You show me love and give me war  
I can't get enough can't take anymore  
Oh no right now baby I'm torn  
Torn baby I'm torn torn  
Torn torn baby I'm torn torn  
Torn from the pages out of our book  
A beautiful tragedy  
I'm torn in between heaven and hell  
'Cause baby when I'm with you  
I just don't know where I'd rather be  
Oh I wanna stay wanna walk out the door  
Oh no right now baby I'm torn  
I can't get enough can't take anymore  
Oh no right now baby I'm torn  
You dry my tears and make it pour  
You show me love and give me war  
I can't get enough can't take anymore  
Oh no right now baby I'm torn
