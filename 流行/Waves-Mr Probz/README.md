### Waves歌词：

My face above the water  
My feet can't touch the ground,  
Touch the ground, and it feels like  
I can see the sands on the horizon  
Everytime you are not around

I'm slowly drifting away  
Wave after wave, wave after wave  
I'm slowly drifting (drifting away)  
And it feels like I'm drowning  
Pulling against the stream  
Pulling against the stream

I wish I could make it easy  
Easy to love me, love me  
But still I reach  
To find a way  
I'm stuck here in between  
I'm looking for the right words to say

I'm slowly drifting, drifting away  
Wave after wave, wave after wave  
I'm slowly drifting (drifting away)  
And it feels like I'm drowning  
Pulling against the stream  
Pulling against the stream
