### Anyone歌词：

Dance with me under the diamonds  
See me like breath in the cold  
Sleep with me here in the silence  
Come kiss me silver and gold  
You say that I won't lose you  
But you can't predict the future  
So just hold on like you will never let go  
Yeah if you ever move on without me  
I need to make sure you know  
That you are the only one I'll ever love  
I gotta tell ya gotta tell ya  
Yeah you  
If it's not you it's not anyone  
I gotta tell ya gotta tell ya  
Looking back on my life  
You're the only good I've ever done  
Ever done  
Yeah you  
If it's not you it's not anyone  
Anyone  
Not anyone  
Forever's not enough time to  
Love you the way that I want  
Love you the way that I want  
'Cause every morning I'll find you  
I fear the day that I don't  
You say that I won't lose you  
But you can't predict the future  
'Cause certain things are out of our control  
Yeah if you ever move on without me  
I need to make sure you know  
That you are the only one I'll ever love  
Only one  
I gotta tell ya gotta tell ya  
Yeah you  
If it's not you it's not anyone  
I gotta tell ya gotta tell ya  
Looking back on my life  
You're the only good I've ever done  
I've ever done  
Yeah you  
If it's not you it's not anyone  
It's not anyone  
Not anyone  
If it's not you it's not anyone  
Oh yeah  
Ooh  
Yeah you are the only one I'll ever love  
I gotta tell ya gotta tell ya  
Yeah you  
If it's not you it's not anyone  
I gotta tell ya gotta tell ya  
Looking back on my life  
You're the only good I've ever done  
Ever done  
Yeah you  
If it's not you it's not anyone
