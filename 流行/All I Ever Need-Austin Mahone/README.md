### All I Ever Need歌词：

Don't the water grow the trees  
Don't the moon pull the tide  
Don't the stars light the sky  
Like you need to light my life  
If you need me anytime  
You know I'm always right by your side  
See I've never felt this love  
You're the only thing that's on my mind

[Pre-chorus:]  
You don't understand how much you really mean to me  
I need you in my life  
You're my necessity  
But believe me you're everything  
That just makes my world complete  
And my love is clear the only thing that I'll ever see

[Chorus:]  
You're all I ever need  
Baby you're amazing  
You're my angel come and save me  
You're all I ever need  
Baby you're amazing  
You're my angel come and save me

Don't the water grow the trees  
Don't the moon pull the tide  
Don't the stars light the sky  
Like you need to light my life  
We can do anything you like  
I know we both can get it right tonight  
You got your walls built up high  
I can tell by looking in your eyes

[Pre-chorus:]  
You don't understand how much you really mean to me  
I need you in my life  
You're my necessity  
But believe me you're everything  
That just makes my world complete  
And my love is clear the only thing that I'll ever see

[Chorus:]  
You're all I ever need  
Baby you're amazing  
You're my angel come and save me  
You're all I ever need  
Baby you're amazing  
You're my angel come and save me

[2x]  
When it comes to you  
Baby I'm addicted  
You're like a drug, no rehab can fix it  
I think you're perfect baby even with your flaws  
You ask what I like about you  
Ooh, I love it all

[Chorus 2x:]  
You're all I ever need  
Baby you're amazing  
You're my angel come and save me  
You're all I ever need  
Baby you're amazing  
You're my angel come and save me
