### Cool歌词：

I saw stars on the pavement  
California dreams  
Looked up through the bright lights  
No stars that I see

You said, "It’s all yours if you take it there."  
I said, "I can’t do it alone, I swear."  
You said, "It’s all yours,  
It’s all yours when you smile."

It’s only you  
Who loves me like you do  
Trying to keep it cool  
But I can’t keep cool about it  
Acting like a fool  
Wanna scream it from the roof  
I’m trying to keep it cool  
But I can’t keep cool about it (about it)

Before you, love, I was lost  
Drifting at sea  
You were the beacon I’d followed home  
You were the one who rescued me

You said, "It’s all yours if you take it there."  
I said, "I can’t do it alone, I swear."  
You said, "It’s all yours,  
It’s all yours when you smile."

It’s only you  
Loves me like you do  
Trying to keep it cool  
But I can’t keep cool about it  
Acting like a fool  
Wanna scream it from the roof  
I’m trying to keep it cool  
But I can’t keep cool about it (about it)

You said, "Oh, whoa.  
I won’t lose you, no, whoa."

It’s only you  
Loves me like you do  
Trying to keep it cool  
But I can’t keep cool about it  
Acting like a fool  
Wanna scream it from the roof  
I’m trying to keep it cool  
But I can’t keep cool about it (about it)
