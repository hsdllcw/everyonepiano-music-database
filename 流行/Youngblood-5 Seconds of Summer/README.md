### Youngblood歌词：

Remember the words you told me love me 'til the day I die  
Surrender my everything 'cause you made me believe you're mine  
Yeah you used to call me baby now you calling me by name  
Takes one to know one yeah  
You beat me at my own d**n game  
You're pushing and pushing and I'm pulling away  
Pulling away from you  
I give I give I give you take give and you take  
Young blood  
Say you want me  
Say you want me  
Out of your life  
And I'm just a dead man walking tonight  
But you need it yeah you need it  
All of the time  
Yeah ooh ooh ooh  
Young blood  
Say you want me  
Say you want me  
Back in your life  
So I'm just a dead man crawling tonight  
Cause I need it yeah I need it  
All of the time  
Yeah ooh ooh ooh  
Lately our conversations end like it's the last goodbye  
Yeah one of us gets too drunk and calls about a hundred times  
So who you been calling baby nobody could take my place  
When you looking at those strangers hope to god you see my face  
Young blood  
Say you want me  
Say you want me  
Out of your life  
And I'm just a dead man walking tonight  
But you need it yeah you need it  
All of the time  
Yeah ooh ooh ooh  
Young blood  
Say you want me  
Say you want me  
Back in your life  
So I'm just a dead man crawling tonight  
Cause I need it yeah I need it  
All of the time  
Yeah ooh ooh ooh  
You're pushing and pushing and I'm pulling away  
Pulling away from you  
I give and I give and I give and you take give and you take  
You're running and running and I'm running away  
Running away from you from you  
Young blood  
Say you want me  
Say you want me  
Out of your life  
And I'm just a dead man walking tonight  
But you need it yeah you need it  
All of the time  
Yeah ooh ooh ooh  
Young blood  
Say you want me  
Say you want me  
Back in your life  
So I'm just a dead man crawling tonight  
Cause I need it yeah I need it  
All of the time  
Yeah ooh ooh ooh  
You're pushing and pushing and I'm pulling away  
Pulling away from you  
I give I give I give you take give and you take  
Young blood  
Say you want me  
Say you want me  
Out of your life  
And I'm just a dead man walking tonight
