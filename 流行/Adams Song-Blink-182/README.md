《 **Adam's Song** 》是美国流行朋克乐队Blink-182演唱的歌曲，收录在他们的第三张专辑《Enema of the
State》中，正是这张专辑为乐队带来了成功。

《 _Adam's Song_ 》是Blink-182在美国现代摇滚歌曲排行榜上排名第二的五首歌曲之。2000年9月5日，这首歌作为专辑《What's My
Age Again?》和《AII the Small Things》之后的第三首CD单曲发行。

这是一首悲伤的慢歌，歌词涉及抑郁和自杀，人声部分由Mark
Hoppus演唱。“Adam”其实是用来比喻主唱Mark在与Blink-182巡演时经历的抑郁。Mark在采访时说:
"Tom和Travis总是有女朋友等在家里，所以他们在巡演结束时有一些期待。但我没有，所以我在巡演时总是很孤独。”哎，多么孤独的主唱。

### Adam's Song歌词：

I never thought I'd die alone  
I laughed the loudest who'd have known  
I traced the cord back to the wall  
No wonder it was never plugged in at all  
I took my time I hurried up  
The choice was mine I didn't think enough  
I'm too depressed to go on  
You'll be sorry when I'm gone  
I never conquered rarely came  
16 just held such better days  
Days when I still felt alive  
We couldn't wait to get outside  
The world was wide too late to try  
The tour was over we'd survived  
I couldn't wait 'til I got home  
To pass the time in my room alone  
I never thought I'd die alone  
Another six months I'll be unknown  
Give all my things to all my friends  
You'll never step foot in my room again  
You'll close it off board it up  
Remember the time that I spilled the cup  
Of apple juice in the hall  
Please tell mom this is not her fault  
I never conquered rarely came  
16 just held such better days  
Days when I still felt alive  
We couldn't wait to get outside  
The world was wide too late to try  
The tour was over we'd survived  
I couldn't wait 'til I got home  
To pass the time in my room alone  
I never conquered rarely came  
Tomorrow holds such better days  
Days when I can still feel alive  
When I can't wait to get outside  
The world is wide the time goes by  
The tour is over I've survived  
I can't wait 'til I get home  
To pass the time in my room alone
