### Amaranth歌词：

Baptized with a perfect name  
The doubting one by heart  
Alone without himself  
War between him and the day  
Need someone to blame  
In the end, little he can do alone  
You believe but what you see  
You receive but what you give  
Caress the one  
The never-fading rain in your heart  
The tears of snow-white sorrow  
Caress the one  
The hiding amaranth  
In a land of the daybreak  
Apart from the wandering pack  
In this brief flight of time we reach  
For the ones, whoever dare  
You believe but what you see  
You receive but what you give  
Caress the one  
The never-fading rain in your heart  
The tears of snow-white sorrow  
Caress the one  
The hiding amaranth  
In a land of the daybreak  
Reaching, searching for something untouched  
Hearing voices of the never-fading calling  
Caress the one  
The never-fading rain in your heart  
The tears of snow-white sorrow  
Caress the one  
The hiding amaranth  
In a land of the daybreak
