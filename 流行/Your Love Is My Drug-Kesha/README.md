### Your Love Is My Drug歌词：

Maybe I need some rehab  
Or maybe just need some sleep  
I got a sick obsession  
I'm seeing it in my dreams  
I'm looking down every alley  
I'm making us desperate cause  
I'm staying up all night hoping  
Hitting my head against the wall  
What you got boy is hard to find  
I think about it all the time  
I'm all strung out my heart is fried  
I just can't get you off my mind  
Because your love your loveyour love is my drug  
Your love your love your love  
I said your love your loveyour love is my drug  
Your love your love your love  
Won't listen to any advice  
Momma's telling me I should think twice  
But love to my own devices  
I'm addicted it's a crisis  
My friends think I've gone crazy  
My judgements getting kind of hazy  
My esteem is gonna be affected  
If I keep it up like a lovesick crack-head  
What you got boy is hard to find  
I think about it all the time  
I'm all strung out my heart is fried  
I just can't get you off my mind  
Because your love your loveyour love is my drug  
Your love your love your love  
I said your love your loveyour love is my drug  
Your love your love your love  
I don't care what people say  
The rush is worth the price I pay  
I get so high when you're with me  
But crash and crave you when you leave  
Hey so I got a question  
Do you wanna have a slumber party  
in my basement  
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum  
Is my love your drug  
Huh your drug  
Huh your drug  
Huh your drug  
Is my love your drug  
Because your love your loveyour love is my drug  
Your love your love your love  
I said your love your loveyour love is my drug  
Your love your love your love  
Because your love your loveyour love is my drug  
Your love your love your love  
I said your love your loveyour love is my drug  
Your love your love your love  
Hey Hey  
So  
Your love your love your love your love is my drug  
I like your beard
