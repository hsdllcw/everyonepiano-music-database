### I Hope歌词：

I I hope she makes you smile  
The way you made me smile on the other end of a phone  
In the middle of a highway driving alone  
Oh baby I I hope you hear a song  
That makes you sing along and gets you thinking about her  
Then the last several miles turns into a blur yeah  
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive  
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night  
I hope you never ever felt more free  
Tell your friends that you're so happy  
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans  
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand  
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams  
She's everything you're ever gonna need  
And then I hope she cheats like you did on me  
And then I hope she cheats like you did on me  
Yeah then I hope she shows up in a 2 am pic from her friend  
Hanging on to a guy and you just ain't him  
I hope you stay up all night all alone waiting by the phone  
And then she calls  
And baby I I hope you work it out  
Forgive and just about forget and take her on a first date again  
And when you lean in for a kiss  
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive  
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night  
I hope you never ever felt more free  
Tell your friends that you're so happy  
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans  
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand  
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams  
She's everything you're ever gonna need  
And then I hope she cheats like you did on me  
And then I hope she cheats like you did on me  
I hope what goes comes all the way around  
I hope she makes you feel the same way  
About her that I feel about you right now  
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive  
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night  
I hope you never ever felt more free  
Tell your friends that you're so happy  
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans  
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand  
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams  
She's everything you're ever gonna need  
And then I hope she cheats like you did on me  
And then I hope she cheats like you did on me  
Like you did on me
