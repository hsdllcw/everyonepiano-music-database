### Babylon歌词：

We only have the weekend  
You can serve it to me ancient city style  
We can party like it's B.C.  
With a pretty sixteenth century smile  
It's the thing that chya' bring  
That chya' bring that chya' bring him  
You and me  
That's gossip  
Strut it out walk a mile  
Serve it ancient city style  
Talk it out babble on  
Battle for your life Babylon  
That's gossip  
What you on  
Money don't talk  
Rip that song  
Gossip babble on  
Battle for your life Babylon  
Ba-ba-Babylon  
Gossip gossip  
Ba-ba-Babylon  
Battle for your life  
Gossip gossip  
Ba-ba-Babylon  
Gossip gossip  
Ba-ba-Babylon  
Bodies moving like a sculpture  
On the top of tower of Babel tonight  
We are climbing up to heaven  
Speaking languages in a BloodPop®  
Moonlight  
It's the thing that chya' bring  
That chya' bring that chya' bring him  
You and me  
That's gossip  
That's gossip  
Strut it out walk a mile  
Serve it ancient city style  
Talk it out babble on  
Battle for your life Babylon  
That's gossip  
What you on  
Money don't talk  
Rip that song  
Gossip babble on  
Battle for your life Babylon  
Ba-ba-Babylon  
Gossip gossip

Talk it out babble on  
Battle for your life Babylon

Rip that song
