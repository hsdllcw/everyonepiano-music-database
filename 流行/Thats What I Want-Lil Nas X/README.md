### Thats What I Want歌词：

One two three four  
Need a boy who can cuddle with me all night  
Keep me warm love me long be my sunlight  
Tell me lies we can argue we can fight  
Yeah we did it before but we'll do it tonight  
That afro black boy with the gold teeth  
He dark skin lookin' at me like he know me  
I wonder if he got the G or the B  
Let me find out and see he comin' over to me yeah  
These days I'm way too lonely  
I'm missin' out I know  
These days I'm way too alone  
And I'm known for givin' love away but  
I want  
I  
Someone to love me  
I need  
I  
Someone who needs me  
'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night  
And it's just me in my dreams  
So I want  
I  
Someone to love  
That's what I f**kin' want  
Look you know it's harder to find in these times  
But I got nothin' but love on my mind  
My mind  
I need a baby while I'm in my prime  
Need an adversary to my down and weary  
Like tell me that's life when I'm stressin' at night  
Be like "You'll be okay" and "Everything is alright" uh  
Love me or nothin' 'cause I'm not wanting anything  
But your loving your body and a little bit of your brain  
These days I'm way too lonely  
I'm missin' out I know  
These days I'm way too alone  
And I'm known for givin' love away but  
I want  
I  
Someone to love me  
I need  
I  
Someone who needs me  
'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night  
And it's just me in my dreams  
So I want  
I  
Someone to love  
That's what I f**kin' want  
I want  
I  
Someone to love me  
I need  
I  
Someone who needs me  
'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night  
And it's just me in my dreams  
So I want  
I  
Someone to love  
That's what I f**kin' want
