**Angels like You** 是由Miley Cyrus录唱的一首歌曲，被收录在于2020年11月27日发行的专辑《Plastic
Hearts》。

这首歌唱得真是让人心碎，其实两人无所谓好坏，只是彼此不合适，做不了对方的Angel，Baby angles like you can't fly down
hell with me，这句包含了多少心酸。Miley带沙哑的音色真是绝了，唱出了破碎感。

### Angels like You歌词：

Mmm mmm mmm  
Flowers in hand waiting for me  
Every word in poetry  
Won't call me by name only baby  
The more that you give the less that I need  
Everyone says I look happy  
When it feels right  
I know that you're wrong for me  
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave  
I brought you down to your knees  
'Cause they say that misery loves company  
It's not your fault I ruin everything  
And it's not your fault I can't be what you need  
Baby angels like you can't fly down hell with me  
I'm everything they said I would be  
La la la  
I'm everything they said I would be  
I'll put you down slow love you goodbye  
Before you let go just one more time  
Take off your clothes pretend that it's fine  
A little more hurt won't kill you tonight  
Your mama says you don't look happy  
Close your eyes  
I know that you're wrong for me  
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave  
I brought you down to your knees  
'Cause they say that misery loves company  
It's not your fault I ruin everything  
And it's not your fault I can't be what you need  
Baby angels like you can't fly down hell with me  
I'm everything they said I would be  
La la la  
La la la la  
La la la  
Oh ah ah  
Ah oh  
I know that you're wrong for me  
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave  
I brought you down to your knees  
'Cause they say that misery loves company  
It's not your fault I ruin everything everything  
And it's not your fault I can't be what you need  
Baby angels like you can't fly down hell with me oh  
Angels like you can't fly down hell with me
