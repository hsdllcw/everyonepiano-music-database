### Selfie (#SELFIE)歌词：

When Jason was at the table  
I kept on seeing him look at me while he was with that other girl  
Do you think he was just doing that to make me jealous?  
Because he was totally texting me all night last night  
and I don't know if it's a booty call or not  
So... like what do you think?  
Did you think that girl was pretty?  
How did that girl even get in here?  
Do you see her?  
She's so short and that dress is so tacky  
Who wears Cheetah?  
It's not even summer, why does the DJ keep on playing "Summertime Sadness"?  
After we go to the bathroom, can we go smoke a cigarette?  
I really need one  
But first,  
LET ME TAKE A SELFIE

[Beat drops]

Can you guys help me pick a filter?  
I don't know if I should go with XX Pro or Valencia  
I wanna look tan  
What should my caption be?  
I want it to be clever  
How about "Livin' with my bitches, hash tag LIVE"  
I only got 10 likes in the last 5 minutes  
Do you think I should take it down?  
LET ME TAKE ANOTHER SELFIE

[Beat drops]

Wait, pause, Jason just liked my selfie  
What a creep  
Is that guy sleeping over there?  
Yeah, the one next to the girl with no shoes on  
That's so ratchet  
That girl is such a fake model  
She definitely bought all her Instagram followers  
Who goes out on Mondays?  
OK, let's go take some shots  
Oh no, ugh I feel like I'm gonna throw up  
Oh wait, nevermind I'm fine  
Let's go dance  
There's no vodka at this table  
Do you know anyone else here?  
Oh my god, Jason just texted me  
Should I go home with him?  
I guess I took a good selfie

Selfie [on repeat]

LET ME TAKE A SELFIE
