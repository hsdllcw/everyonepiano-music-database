### Call Me歌词：

You can call me 4 in the morning, I'll give you what you need  
Yeah, 4 in the morning, everyone's 'bout to leave  
I usually don't give in so damn easily  
But you hit bottoms, hit them like no other  
You give me feels, you give me feels, yeah  
Something that's real, I wanna let you know that  
You can call me, oh, if you're lonely and need somebody  
You can call me, middle of the night when you need my body  
You can call me, you can call me, you know that you can tell everyone  
If you want me the way I want you, got my number, you know what to do, yeah  
Run it by you, 4 in the morning, you put me in the mood  
Yeah, 4 in the morning, I'm smoking on the roof  
We are young, baby, so it's the night we can rendezvous  
'Cause you hit bottoms, hit them like no other  
You give me feels, you give me feels, yeah  
Something that's real, I wanna let you know that  
You can call me, oh, if you're lonely and need somebody  
You can call me, middle of the night when you need my body  
You can call me, you can call me, you know that you can tell everyone  
If you want me the way I want you, got my number, you know what to do, yeah  
It's a beautiful night, got a beautiful meal for two  
If you don't eat me up soon, it's likely that I call you  
We are young, baby, so it's the night we can rendezvous  
'Cause you hit bottoms, hit them like no other  
You can call me, oh, if you're lonely and need somebody  
You can call me, middle of the night when you need my body  
You can call me, you can call me, you know that you can tell everyone  
If you want me the way I want you, got my number, you know what to do, yeah
