**Loyal** 是R&B天王Chris Brown联手Lil
Wayne和Tyga的强势新单。最喜欢这种中板的R&B节奏，轻松欢快中扭动身体什么的最给力了！当然我吸在欢乐的party人潮中还是会秀秀舞技，耍耍萌~更有天王#Usher#头戴貂毛帽出镜，与陕北天王一起型男二人组亮瞎全场。

  
_Chris Brown_ 是美国当红流行小天王、演员。2005年末，年仅16岁的他发布了首张同名专辑《Chris
Brown》。该专辑中收录了打榜单曲《Run It!》，该曲曾登上告示牌单曲榜头名，这使得他成为继1995年蒙蒂尔·乔丹（英文：Montell
Jordan）之后，首位出道单曲即登上排行榜头名的男性歌手。该专辑在全美销售量超过二百万拷贝，并被美国唱片业协会（RIAA）认证为双白金销量唱片。

### Loyal歌词：

I wasn't born last night  
I know this hoes ain't right  
But you was blowning up her phone last night  
But she ain't have her ring nor her ring on last night, oh  
Nigga, that's that nerve  
Why give a bitch your heart?  
When she rather have a purse  
Why give a bitch your inch?  
When she rather have nine  
You know how the game goes  
She be mine by half time, I'm the shit, oh  
Nigga, that's that nerve  
You all about her, and she all about hers  
Birdman Junior in this bitch, no flamingos  
And I done did everything but trust these hoes  
(CB fuck with me!)  
When a rich nigga want you  
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya  
These hoes ain't loyal  
These hoes ain't loyal  
Yeah, yeah, let me see  
Just got rich  
Took a broke nigga's bitch  
I can make a broke bitch rich  
But I don't fuck with broke bitches  
Got a white girl with some fake titties  
I took her to the bay with me  
Eyes closed smoking marijuana  
Rolling up the bomb molly I'm a rockstar  
She wanna do drugs, smoke weed, get drunk  
She wanna see a nigga trapped  
She wanna fuck all the rappers  
When a rich nigga want you  
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya  
These hoes ain't loyal  
These hoes ain't loyal  
Yeah, yeah, let me see  
Black girl with a big booty  
If she a bad bitch, let's get to it, right away  
We up in this club  
Bring me the bottles  
I know girl, that you came in this bitch with your man  
That's a no-no girl  
All this money in the air  
I wanna see you dance  
Just got rich  
Took a broke nigga's bitch  
I can make a broke bitch rich  
But I don't fuck with broke bitches  
When a rich nigga want you  
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya  
These hoes ain't loyal  
These hoes ain't loyal  
Yeah, yeah, let me see  
Once the roc in the system?  
Ain't no tell her will I fuck them, will I diss them  
That's what they be yelling, I'm a pimp by blood  
No relation, I don't chase some, I replay some  
LVs, Hermes, Dolces  
Them hoes, ain't loyal, they rotate  
School me to the game, now I'm on a goody  
Put it in the loader  
She was riding in the hoot  
Fuck that bitch  
I got my own ho  
Fuck your weed  
I got my own smoke  
Had to put my mink back on  
Tell that bitch, put her ring back on  
Montana  
Come on, come on, girl  
Why you frontin'?  
Baby show me something  
When I call her, she gon' leave  
And I bet that bottom dollar she gon' cheat  
Come on, come on, girl  
Why you frontin'?  
Baby show me something  
You just spent your ring on her  
And it's all for nothing  
When a rich nigga want you  
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya  
These hoes ain't loyal  
These hoes ain't loyal  
Yeah, yeah, let me see  
When a rich nigga want you  
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya  
These hoes ain't loyal
