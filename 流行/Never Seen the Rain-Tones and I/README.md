### Never Seen the Rain歌词：

All your life no  
You couldn't be mad about it  
You've been sailing sailing oh  
You couldn't be sad about it  
And it's been all this time  
And you haven't lived without it  
You are shining shining it seems though  
That your life you've found it  
No oh oh oh  
But you've never  
No you've never seen the rain  
No oh oh oh  
But you've never  
No oh oh oh  
You've never seen the rain  
And it gets you down  
But that's okay  
You've been pushed 'round  
You feel the pain  
And when you fall  
Just lean on me  
'Cause you've never known  
Never seen never smelt never felt  
The rain  
Rain' never felt the rain rain rain  
It's a cold dark night and  
No ones tryin' to find ya  
You're just coasting coasting by  
'Cause nothing seems to mind ya  
No oh oh oh  
But you've never  
No you've never seen the rain  
No oh oh oh  
But you've never  
No oh oh oh  
You've never seen the rain  
And it gets you down  
But that's okay  
You've been pushed 'round  
You feel the pain  
And when you fall  
Just lean on me  
'Cause you've never known  
Never seen never smelt never felt  
The rain  
Rain never felt the rain rain rain  
And it gets you down  
But that's okay  
You've been pushed 'round  
You feel the pain  
And when you fall  
Just lean on me  
'Cause you've never known  
Never seen never smelt never felt  
The rain  
Rain never felt the rain rain rain
