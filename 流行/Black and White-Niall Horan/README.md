### Black and White歌词：

That first night we were standin' at your door  
Fumblin' for your keys then I kissed you  
Ask me if I wanna come inside  
'Cause we didn't wanna end the night  
Then you took my hand and I followed you  
Yeah I see us in black and white  
Crystal clear on a starlit night  
In all your gorgeous colours  
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life  
See you standing in your dress  
Swearin' in front of all our friends  
There'll never be another  
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life  
Now we're sittin' here in your livin' room  
Tellin' stories while we share a drink or two  
And there's a vision I've been holdin' in my mind  
We're sixty-five and you asked  
When did I first know I always knew  
And I see us in black and white  
Crystal clear on a starlit night  
In all your gorgeous colours  
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life  
See you standing in your dress  
Swearin' in front of all our friends  
There'll never be another  
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life  
And I want the world to witness when we finally say "I do"  
It's the way you love I gotta give it back to you  
I can't promise picket fences or sunny afternoons  
But at night when I close my eyes  
I see us in black and white  
Crystal clear on a starlit night  
There'll never be another  
I promise that I'll love you  
I see us in black and white  
Crystal clear on a starlit night  
In all your gorgeous colours  
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life  
See you standing in your dress  
Swearin' in front of all our friends  
There'll never be another  
Never be  
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life  
And there'll never be another  
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life
