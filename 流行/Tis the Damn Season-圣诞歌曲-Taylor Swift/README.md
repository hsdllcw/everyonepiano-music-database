### 'Tis the Damn Season歌词：

If I wanted to know who you were hanging with  
While I was gone I would have asked you  
It's the kind of cold fogs up windshield glass  
But I felt it when I passed you  
There's an ache in you  
Put there by the ache in me  
But if it's all the same to you  
It's the same to me  
So we could call it even  
You could call me "babe" for the weekend  
'Tis the d**n season write this down  
I'm staying at my parents' house  
And the road not taken looks real good now  
And it always leads to you and my hometown  
I parked my car right between the Methodist  
And thе school that used to be ours  
The holidays linger like bad perfume  
You can run but only so far  
I escaped it too remember how you watched me leave  
But if it's okay with you it's okay with me  
We could call it even  
You could call me "babe" for the weekend  
'Tis the d**n season write this down  
I'm staying at my parents' house  
And the road not taken looks real good now  
Time flies messy as the mud on your truck tires  
Now I'm missing your smile hear me out  
We could just ride around  
And the road not taken looks real good now  
And it always leads to you and my hometown  
Sleep in half the day just for old times' sake  
I won't ask you to wait if you don't ask me to stay  
So I'll go back to L A and the so-called friends  
Who'll write books about me if I ever make it  
And wonder about the only soul who can tell which smiles I'm faking  
And the heart I know I'm breaking is my own  
To leave the warmest bed I've ever known  
We could call it even  
Even though I'm leaving  
And I'll be yours for the weekend  
'Tis the d**n season  
We could call it even  
You could call me "babe" for the weekend  
'Tis the d**n season write this down  
I'm staying at my parents' house  
And the road not taken looks real good now  
Time flies messy as the mud on your truck tires  
Now I'm missing your smile hear me out  
We could just ride around  
And the road not taken looks real good now  
And it always leads to you and my hometown  
And it always leads to you and my hometown
