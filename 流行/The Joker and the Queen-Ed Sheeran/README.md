### The Joker and the Queen歌词：

How was I to know  
It's a crazy thing  
I showed you my hand  
And you still let me win  
Who was I to say  
That this was meant to be  
The road that was broken brought us together  
And I know you could fall for a thousand kings  
And hearts that could give you a diamond ring  
When I fold you see the best in me  
The joker and the queen  
I was upside down from the outside in  
You came to the table and you went all in  
With a single word and a gentle touch  
You turned a moment into forever  
And I know you could fall for a thousand kings  
And hearts that could give you a diamond ring  
When I fold you see the best in me  
The joker and the queen  
And I know you could fall for a thousand kings  
And hearts that could give you a diamond ring  
When I folded you saw the best in me  
The joker and the queen  
The joker and the queen
