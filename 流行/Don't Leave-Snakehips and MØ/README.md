### Don't Leave歌词：

[Verse 1]  
You know me  
Now and then, I'm a mess  
Please don't hold that against me  
I'm a girl with a temper and heat  
I know I can be crazy  
[Pre-Chorus 1]  
But I'm not just a fuck-up, I'm the fuck-up you need  
I don't hear nobody when you focus on me  
Perfectly imperfect, yeah, I hope that you see  
Tell me you see  
'Cause I know that you've been thinking 'bout it  
[Chorus]  
Don't leave  
Shut your mind off and let your heart breathe  
You don't need to be worried  
I may not ever get my shit together  
But ain't nobody gonna love you better  
Don't go  
What we have here is irreplaceable  
No, I won't trade this for nothing  
I may not ever get my shit together  
But ain't nobody gonna love you better than me, yeah  
Love you better than me (oh, whoa-oh)  
[Verse 2]  
In a room full of people with you  
I don't see anybody else, no  
When we fight, and you're right  
So sorry, I make it just so difficult  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
But I'm not just a fuck-up, I'm the fuck-up you love  
We ain't like nobody else, tell me so what  
Perfectly imperfect, yeah, baby, that's us  
Baby, that's us  
'Cause I know that you've been thinking 'bout it  
[Chorus]  
Don't leave  
Shut your mind off and let your heart breathe  
You don't need to be worried  
I may not ever get my shit together  
But ain't nobody gonna love you better  
Don't go  
What we have here is irreplaceable  
No, I won't trade this for nothing  
I may not ever get my shit together  
But ain't nobody gonna love you better  
[Bridge]  
Sitting in the living room  
You look at me, I stare at you  
I see the doubt, I see the love  
I have and it is all for you  
Let me wrap myself around you, baby  
Let me tell you you are everything, you are  
Losing my words, I don't know where to start  
But baby, don't leave me  
Shut your mind off and let your heart hear me  
I won't trade this for nothing  
I may not ever get my shit together  
But ain't nobody gonna love you better  
[Chorus]  
Don't leave  
Shut your mind off and let your heart breathe  
You don't need to be worried  
I may not ever get my shit together  
But ain't nobody gonna love you better  
(There ain't nobody gonna love you better than me)  
Don't go  
What we have here is irreplaceable  
No, I won't trade this for nothing  
I may not ever get my shit together  
But ain't nobody gonna love you better than me, yeah  
Love you better than me
