### Fallin'歌词：

Jonah Marais：  
Caught in the moment not even thinkin' twice  
Everything's frozen nothing but you and I  
Can't stop my heart from beating why do I love this feeling  
Make me a promise tell me you'll stay with me  
If I'm bein' honest I don't know where this leads  
But that's the only question baby don't keep me guessin'  
Daniel Seavey：  
Ooh you are my muse I feel so reckless  
Oh you're makin' me makin' me makin' me give in  
Zach Herron：  
Oh baby I can feel the rush of adrenaline  
I'm not scared to jump if you want to  
Let's just fall in love for the hell of it  
Maybе just keep fallin'  
I can feel the rush of adrenaline  
I'm not scared to jump 'cause I want you  
Let's just fall in love for the hell of it  
Maybe just keep fallin'  
Corbyn Besson：  
When I'm around ya I feel it in my veins  
Something about ya that's makin' me go insane  
We have a storm to weather my little sweet surrender  
Daniel Seavey：  
Ooh you are my muse I feel so reckless  
Oh you're makin' me makin' me makin' me give in  
Zach Herron/Both：  
Oh baby I can feel the rush of adrenaline  
I'm not scared to jump if you want to  
Let's just fall in love for the Hell of it  
Maybe just keep fallin'  
I can feel the rush of adrenaline  
I'm not scared to jump 'cause I want you  
Let's just fall in love for the Hell of it  
Maybe just keep fallin'  
Daniel Seavey/Both：  
Fallin' fallin'
