### Perfect歌词：

I found a love for me  
Darling just dive right in and follow my lead  
Well I found a girl beautiful and sweet  
OhI never knew you were the someone waiting for me  
Cause we were just kids when we fell in love  
Not knowing what it was I will not give you up this time  
But darling just kiss me slow your heart is all I own  
And in your eyes you're holding mine  
Baby I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms  
Barefoot on the grass listening to our favourite song  
When you said you looked a mess I whispered underneath my breath  
But you heard it darling you look perfect tonight  
Well I found a woman stronger than anyone I know  
She shares my dreams I hope that someday I'll share her home  
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets  
To carry love to carry children of our own  
We are still kids but we're so in love fighting against all odds  
I know we'll be alright this time  
Darling just hold my hand be my girl I'll be your man  
I see my future in your eyes  
Baby I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms  
Barefoot on the grass listening to our favourite song  
When I saw you in that dress looking so beautiful  
I don't deserve this darling you look perfect tonight  
Baby I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms  
Barefoot on the grass listening to our favourite song  
I have faith in what I see  
Now I know I have met an angel in person  
And she looks perfect I don't deserve this  
You look perfect tonight
