_NASA_ 是由美国流行女歌手Ariana Grande录唱的一首歌曲，被收录在她2019年2月8日发行的录音室专辑Thank
U，Next。俏皮的声音和空灵的鼓点声给人一种在太空中遨游的错觉，流行偏爵士的风格更为这份迷幻感添了几抹浅蓝色。

### NASA歌词：

This is one small step for woman  
One giant leap for woman-kind  
I'd rather be alone tonight  
You can say I love you through the phone tonight  
Really don't wanna be in your arms tonight  
I'll just use my covers to stay warm tonight  
Think I'm better off here all alone tonight  
Ain't no checkin' on when I get home tonight  
Just makin' sure I'm good on my own tonight  
Even though there isn't nothin' wrong tonight  
Yeah I'm just sayin' baby  
I can't really miss you if I'm with you  
And when I miss you it'll change the way I kiss you  
Baby you know time apart is beneficial  
It's like I'm the universe and you'll be N-A-S-A  
Give you the whole world I'ma need space  
I'ma need space I'ma I'ma need  
You know I'm a star space I'ma need space  
I'ma need space I'ma I'ma need space N-A-S-A  
Give you the whole world I'ma need space  
I'ma need space I'ma I'ma need  
You know I'm a star space I'ma need space  
I'ma need space I'ma I'ma need space N-A-S-A  
Bottom line  
Usually I would love it if you stayed the night  
I just think I'm on another page tonight  
It ain't nothing wrong with saying I need me time  
Usually I would orbit around you  
But gravity seems to be the only thing that's pulling me  
You'll be my rise and shine soon as them stars align mmm  
Baby I can't really miss you if I'm with you  
And when I miss you it'll change the way I kiss you  
Baby you know time apart is beneficial  
It's like I'm the universe and you'll be N-A-S-A  
Give you the whole world I'ma need space  
I'ma need space I'ma I'ma need  
You know I'm a star space I'ma need space  
I'ma need space I'ma I'ma need space N-A-S-A  
Give you the whole world I'ma need space  
I'ma need space I'ma I'ma need  
You know I'm a star space I'ma need space  
I'ma need space I'ma I'ma need space N-A-S-A  
You don't wanna leave me but I'm tryna self-discover  
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under  
You don't wanna leave me but I'm tryna self-discover  
You don't wanna leave me but I'm tryna self-discover  
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under  
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under  
Alone tonight  
You can say I love you through the phone tonight
