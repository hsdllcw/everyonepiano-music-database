### Comfort Crowd歌词：

This hurt that I'm holding's getting heavy  
But I'mma keep a smile on my shoulders 'til I'm sweaty  
Begging on my knees  
Screamin' someone come and help me  
But by the time they're there  
I've already hid the body  
My breath's gettin' short and I'm unsteady  
Wellin' up in tears as I lay upon your belly  
Telling you I'm fine  
I don't really need nobody  
But you say through a sigh  
That I said that lie already  
I just needed company now  
Yeah I just needed someone around  
Yeah I don't care what song that we play  
Or mess that we make  
Just company now  
Comfort crowd  
Comfort crowd  
We rot thinkin' lots about nothing  
Yeah I could spend a lifetime  
Sitting here talkin'  
And even if I cry all over your body  
You don't really mind  
Say you like your shirt soggy  
Yeah I just needed company now  
Yeah I just needed someone around  
Yeah I don't care what song that we play  
Or mess that we make  
Just company now  
Comfort crowd  
Comfort crowd  
We mess around  
And laugh too loud  
And make the sounds  
We try to hide when people are around  
By blood we're bound  
Through ups and downs  
Their smiles and pouts  
Comfort crowd  
You can always count  
Yeah I just needed company now  
Yeah I just needed someone around  
Yeah I don't care what song that we play  
Or mess that we make  
Just company now  
Comfort crowd
