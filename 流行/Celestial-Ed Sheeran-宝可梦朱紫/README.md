### Celestial歌词：

You see tonight it could go either way  
Hearts balanced on a razer blade  
We are designed to love and break  
Until rince and repeat it all again  
I get stuck when the world's too loud  
And things don't look up when you're going down  
And I know your arms are reaching out  
From somewhere beyond the clouds  
You make me feel  
Like my troubled heart is a million miles away  
You make me feel  
Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out in the space  
Celestial  
Celestial  
You see the light shinin' through the rain  
A thousand colors in thе brighter shade  
Needed to rise from the lowest place  
There's a silver lining that surrounds the gray  
When I get lost will you come back around  
Things don't look up when you're going down  
Know your arms are reaching out  
From somewhere beyond the clouds  
You make me feel  
Like my troubled heart is a million miles away  
You make me feel  
Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out in the space  
Celestial  
Celestial ohh  
We were made to be  
Nothing more than this  
Finding magic in all the smallest things  
When we notice that's what really matters is  
Make tonight go on and on and on  
You make me feel  
We were made to be  
Nothing more than this  
Finding magic in all the smallest things  
You make me feel  
When we notice that's what really matters is  
Let's make tonight go on and on and on  
You make me feel  
Like my troubled heart is a million miles away  
You make me feel  
Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out in the space  
Celestial ohh  
Celestial ohh  
Celestial ohh  
We were made to be  
Nothing more than this  
Finding magic in all the smallest things  
When we notice that's what really matters is  
Make tonight go on and on and on  
Celestial
