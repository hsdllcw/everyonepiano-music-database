### Mary's Boy Child歌词：

Long time ago in Bethlehem  
So the Holy Bible says  
Mary's Boy Child, Jesus Christ  
Was born on Christmas Day.  
Hark, now hear the angels sing  
New King's born today  
And man will live forevermore  
Because of Christmas day.  
Trumpet sound and angels sing  
Listen to what they say  
And man will live forevermore  
Because of Christmas day.  
While shepherds watched their flocks by night  
They saw a bright new shining star  
And heard a choir from heaven sing  
The music came from afar.  
Now Joseph and his wife Mary  
Came to Bethlehem that night  
They found no place to bear her Child  
Not a single room was in sight.  
Hark, now hear the angels sing,  
New King's born today  
And man will live forevermore  
Because of Christmas day.  
Trumpet sound and angels sing  
Listen to what they say  
And man will live forevermore  
Because of Christmas day.  
Christmas day.  
Christmas day.  
By and by they found a little nook  
In a stable all forlorn  
And in a manger cold and dark  
Mary's little Boy Child was born.  
Trumpets sound and angels sing  
Listen to what they say  
That man will live forevermore  
Because of Christmas day...
