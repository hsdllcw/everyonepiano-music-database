**Conversations in the Dark双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Conversations in the Dark_ 是美国歌手、词曲作者John
Legend演唱的歌曲。歌词中充满着一个人温柔浓烈的爱，却没有回应的感觉，像是爱而不得，或是简单的情话，于无声处。John的音乐就像是咖啡，浓和香才是评判的惟一标准。他是一个学者型的灵魂乐歌者，他不仅只是一个歌手，更像是一个R&B音乐和灵魂乐的布道者。

### Conversations in the Dark歌词：

Talk less our conversations in the dark  
World is sleeping I'm awake with you with you  
Watch movies that we've both already seen  
I ain't even looking at the screen  
It's true I got my eyes on you  
And you say that you're not worth it  
You get hung up on your flaws  
With my eyes you are perfect as you are  
I won't ever try to change you change you  
I will always want the same you same you  
Swear on everything I pray to  
That I won't break your heart  
I'll be there when you get lonely lonely  
Keep the secrets that you told me told me  
And your love is all you owe me  
And I won't break your heart  
On Sunday mornings we sleep in 'til noon  
Oh I could sleep wherever next to you next to you  
And we we got places we both gotta be  
But there ain't nothing I would rather do  
Than blow off all my plans for you  
And you say that you're not worth it  
And get hung up on your flaws  
But in my eyes you are perfect as you are  
As you are  
I won't ever try to change you change you  
I will always want the same you same you  
Swear on everything I pray to  
That I won't break your heart  
I'll be there when you get lonely lonely  
Keep the secrets that you told me told me  
And your love is all you owe me  
And I won't break your heart  
When no one seems to notice  
And your days they seem so hard  
My darling you should know this  
My love is everywhere you are  
I won't ever try to change you change you  
Yeah  
I will always want the same you same you  
Oh-oh  
Swear on everything I pray to  
That I won't break your heart  
Yeah  
I'll be there when you get lonely lonely  
Oh when you get lonely  
Keep the secrets that you told me told me  
Yeah-yeah  
And your love is all you owe me  
And I won't break your heart  
Ooh  
Ooh  
I won't break your heart
