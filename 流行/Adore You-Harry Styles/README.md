### Adore You歌词：

Walk in your rainbow paradise  
Strawberry lipstick state of mind  
I get so lost inside your eyes  
Would you believe it  
You don't have to say you love me  
You don't have to say nothing  
You don't have to say you're mine  
Honey  
I'd walk through fire for you  
Just let me adore you  
Oh honey  
I'd walk through fire for you  
Just let me adore you  
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do  
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do  
Your wonder under summer skies  
Brown skin and lemon over ice  
Would you believe it  
You don't have to say you love me  
I just wanna tell you something  
Lately you've been on my mind  
Honey  
I'd walk through fire for you  
Just let me adore you  
Oh honey  
I'd walk through fire for you  
Just let me adore you  
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do  
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do  
It's the only thing I'll ever do  
It's the only thing I'll ever do  
It's the only thing I'll ever do  
It's the only thing I'll ever do  
It's the only thing I'll ever do  
It's the only thing I'll ever do  
It's the only thing I'll ever do  
It's the only thing I'll ever do  
I'd walk through fire for you  
Just let me adore you  
Oh honey  
I'd walk through fire for you  
Just let me adore you  
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do  
I'd walk through fire for you  
Just let me adore you  
Oh honey  
It's the only thing I'll ever do  
Oh honey  
It's the only thing I'll ever do  
I'd walk through fire for you  
Just let me adore you  
It's the only thing I'll ever do  
Oh honey  
Just let me adore you  
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
