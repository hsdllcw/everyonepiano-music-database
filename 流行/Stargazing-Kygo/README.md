### Stargazing歌词：

You're saying it's hopeless  
That I should hope less  
Heaven can help us  
Well maybe she might  
You say it's beyond us  
What is beyond us  
Let's see and decide decide  
We've been meteoric  
Even before this  
Burns half as long when it's  
Twice as bright  
So if it's beyond us  
Then it's beyond us  
Let's see and decide decide  
And I will still be here  
Stargazing  
I still look up look up look up for love  
I will still be here  
Stargazing  
I still look up look up look up for love  
For love  
For love  
For love  
For love  
I'm trying to save us  
You don't wanna save us  
You blame human nature and  
Say it's unkind  
Let's make up our own minds  
We've got our whole lives  
Let's see and decide  
Decide  
And I will still be here  
Stargazing  
I still look up look up look up for love  
Stars don't disappear  
They keep blazing  
Even when the night is over  
And I will still be here  
Stargazing  
I still look up look up look up for love  
Stars don't disappear  
They keep blazing  
Even when the night is over  
That's how I find the light  
That's how I find the light  
For love  
For love  
That's how I find the light  
That's how I find the light  
For love
