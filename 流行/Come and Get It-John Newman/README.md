### Come and Get It歌词：

I have been crazy  
But that’s just alright, alright  
I have been lonely  
But that’s just alright, alright

My feelings I don’t  
Hide them, hide them, hide them  
Inside they keep on  
Burning, burning, burning  
Your feelings you shouldn’t  
Hide them, hide them, hide them  
From me..  
Nah na na nooo ‘right

Come and get it if you really want it  
Come and get it if you really need it  
[x4]

I don’t feel so unfortunate  
But that’s just alright, alright  
I have been treated so badly  
But that’s just alright, alright

My feelings I don’t  
Hide them, hide them, hide them  
Inside they keep on  
Burning, burning, burning  
Your feelings you shouldn’t  
Hide them, hide them, hide them  
From me..  
Nah na na nooo ‘right

Come and get it if you really want it  
Come and get it if you really need it  
[x4]

Every man have been broken  
Every women too  
The reason I think I’m something special baby  
Is ‘cos I was never broken by you

Come and get it if you really want it  
Come and get it if you really need it  
[x4]
