### Somebody Like U歌词：

Reflections in the mirror bathroom light  
Both hands on the sink I'm holding tight  
Why are you still glued in my mind  
Silly little me can't win this fight  
Even though I know that you're far gone  
And instead of maybe moving on  
I'm catching these feelings  
Holding on to the pieces  
It's hitting me hard now that I'm  
Dancing with somebody like you  
Lose myself in every move  
Oh I hate the things you're making me do  
Somebody like you  
It hurts like hell  
Searching for you in someone else  
But I can't help myself I do  
Somebody like you  
Looking for your Prius in the parking lot  
I know it's not there but it's all I got  
Rain is pouring down drowning my thoughts  
Guess you found yourself another spot  
Even though I know that you're far gone  
And instead of maybe moving on  
I'm catching these feelings  
Holding on to the pieces  
It's hitting me hard now that I'm  
Dancing with somebody like you  
Lose myself in every move  
Oh I hate the things you're making me do  
Somebody like you  
It hurts like hell  
Searching for you in someone else  
But I can't help myself I do  
Somebody like you  
Somebody like you  
Somebody like you
