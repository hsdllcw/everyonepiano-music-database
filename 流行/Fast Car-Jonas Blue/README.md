### Fast Car歌词：

You got a fast car  
I want a ticket to anywhere  
Maybe we make a deal  
Maybe together we can get somewhere  
Any place is better  
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose  
Maybe we'll make something  
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove  
You got a fast car  
And I got a plan to get us out of here  
I've been working at a convenience store  
Managed to save just a little bit of money  
We won't have to drive too far  
Just across the border and into the city  
You and I can both get jobs  
And finally see what it means to be living  
You got a fast car  
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?  
We gotta make a decision  
We leave tonight or live and die this way  
So I remember we were driving, driving in your car  
The speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk  
City lights lay out before us  
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder  
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged  
And I, I had a feeling that I could be someone  
Had a feeling that I could be someone  
You see, my old man's got a problem  
He lives with the bottle, that's the way it is  
He says his body's too old for working  
I say, his body's too young to look like his  
My mama went off and left him  
She wanted more from life than he could give  
I said, somebody's got to take care of him  
So I quit school and that's what I did  
You got a fast car  
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves  
You still ain't got a job  
And I work in a market as a checkout girl  
I know things will get better  
You'll find work and I'll get promoted  
We'll move out of the shelter  
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs  
You got a fast car  
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?  
We gotta make a decision  
We leave tonight or live and die this way  
So I remember we were driving, driving in your car  
The speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk  
City lights lay out before us  
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder  
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged  
And I, I had a feeling that I could be someone  
Had a feeling that I could be someone
