### It's Ok歌词：

She could always hear every word they say  
Everybody walks like they just know the way  
Every single day holding back the tears  
She'd never say a word 'cause there's nobody that hears  
It's okay to be not okay  
It's just fine to be out of your mind  
Breathe in deep just a day at a time  
'Cause it's okay to be out of your mind mind  
Mine is broken  
How is yours  
Sure it helps to hear the news and political discourse  
Fear that is what he felt  
Every single day 'cause all the boys would play  
Don't you dare be weak emasculated freak  
Last up on the fence tell me where's the sense  
It's okay to be not okay  
It's just fine to be out of your mind  
Breathe in deep just a day at a time  
'Cause it's okay to be out of your mind  
I don't want this body I don't want this voice  
I don't wanna be here but I guess I have no choice  
Just let me live my truth that's all I wanna do  
Baby you're not broken just a little bit confused  
It's okay to be not okay  
I need you here with me  
It's just fine to be out of your mind  
I can't do it all alone  
Breathe in deep just a day at a time  
'Cause it's okay to be out of your mind  
It's okay out of your mind  
It's okay to be not okay  
I need you here with me  
It's just fine to be out of your mind  
I can't do it all alone  
Breathe in deep just a day at a time  
'Cause it's okay to be out of your mind  
It's okay come on and on and on and on  
La la la la-la la la la la-la  
La la la la-la la la la la-la  
La la la la-la la la la la-la  
La la la la-la la la la la-la la
