英伦独立流行天后Marina于5月19日发布了单曲 **Ancient Dreams In A Modern Land**
，且此曲收录在同名专辑Ancient Dreams In A Modern Land中。

_Ancient Dreams In A Modern Land_ 是MARINA出道以来对社会现状批判最辛辣最生猛的一张专辑。Purge the
Poison中屡屡指名道姓地点出一些让美国尴尬的事件，让人直呼过瘾。除了歌词中宣泄的情感外，专辑的音乐性也一如既往的强。MARINA回归了Electra
Heart时期的电气流行（Electro-pop）风格，让我们又想起了那个巅峰时期的马钻，洋溢着青春活力和性感。

同时，网站还为大家提供了《[ **Purge the Poison**](Music-13011-Purge-the-Poison-Marina.html
"Purge the Poison")》曲谱下载

### Ancient Dreams in a Modern Land歌词：

Our ancestors had to fight to survive  
Just so we could have a chance of a life  
We're not here so we can blow it all  
We could bear witness to the rise and the fall  
Ancient dreams in a modern land  
I'm trying to get back as fast I can  
Back to a time before I had form  
Back to a time before I was born  
You don't have to be like everybody else  
You don't have to fit into the norm  
You are not here to conform  
I am here to take a look inside myself  
Recognize that I could be the eye the eye of the storm  
I am not my body not my mind or my brain  
Ha  
Not my thoughts or feelings I am not my DNA  
I am the observer I'm a witness of life  
I live in the space between the stars and the sky  
What's your purpose why were you put on Earth  
You could be lost but you belong to the world  
We're now living in a seminal age  
The walls are being broken and we're ready for change  
Ancient dreams in a modern land  
I'm trying to get back as fast I can  
Back to a time before I had form  
Back to a time before I was born  
You don't have to be like everybody else  
You don't have to fit into the norm  
You are not here to conform  
I am here to take a look inside myself  
Recognize that I could be the eye the eye of the storm  
I am not my body not my mind or my brain  
Ha  
Not my thoughts or feelings I am not my DNA  
I am the observer I'm a witness of life  
I live in the space between the stars and the sky  
From the heart of Malaysia  
To the dark Himalayas  
From the day you were born  
You are not here to conform  
You don't have to be like everybody else  
You don't have to fit into the norm  
You are not here to conform  
I am here to take a look inside myself  
Recognize that I could be the eye the eye of the storm  
I am not my body not my mind or my brain  
Ha  
Not my thoughts or feelings I am not my DNA  
I am the observer I'm a witness of life  
I live in the space between the stars and the sky
