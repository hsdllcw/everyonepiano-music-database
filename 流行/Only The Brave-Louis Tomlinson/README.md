**Only The Brave双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Only The Brave_ 是英国男歌手Louis Tomlinson演唱的歌曲。收录在其专辑Walls
中。这是一首只为勇敢者唱的歌，其实你才是最勇敢的男孩，总能将身边的人保护的很好。你是经历了尘世的brave
man，如果生活无法将你打倒，那就将它征服。这首歌是全专最爱很有质感，和别的歌都不一样，副歌只重复了一遍，让人意犹未尽。

### Only The Brave歌词：

Pour mercy mercy on me set fire to history  
I'm breakin' my own rules I'm cryin' like a fool  
Tall stories on the page short glories on the fade  
I been close enough to touch but I never cared for love  
It's a church of burnt romances  
And I'm too far gone to pray  
It's a solo song and it's only for the brave  
If the truth tell darling you'd feel  
Like there ain't enough dying stars in your sky  
It's a tall tale and it's only hello hello no goodbye  
Goodbye  
Pour mercy mercy on me I'll fall upon my knees  
And they'll say "I told you so  
Come on when you know you know"  
All the lonely shadow dances from the cradle to the grave  
It's a solo song and it's only for the brave
