### Ordinary Love歌词：

The sea wants to kiss the golden shore  
The sunlight warms your skin  
All the beauty that's been lost before  
Wants to find us again

I can't fight you anymore  
It's you I'm fighting for  
The sea throws rocks together  
But time leaves us polished stones

We can't fall any further  
If we can't feel ordinary love  
And we cannot reach any higher  
If we can't deal with ordinary love

Birds fly high in the summer sky  
And rest on the breeze  
The same wind will take care of you and I  
We'll build our house in the trees

Your heart is on my sleeve  
Did you put it there with a magic marker?  
For years I would believe  
That the world couldn't wash it away

'Cause we can't fall any further  
If we can't feel ordinary love  
And we cannot reach any higher  
If we can't deal with ordinary love

Are we tough enough  
For ordinary love

We can't fall any further  
If we can't feel ordinary love  
And we cannot reach any higher  
If we can't deal with ordinary love

We can't fall any further  
If we can't feel ordinary love  
And we cannot reach any higher  
If we can't deal with ordinary love
