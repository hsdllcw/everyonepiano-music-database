### Boyfriend歌词：

I'm a mother fuckin' train wreck  
I don't wanna be too much  
But I don't wanna miss your touch  
And you don't seem to give a f**k  
I don't wanna keep you waiting  
But I do just what I have to do  
And I might not be the one for you  
But you ain't about to have no boo  
'Cause I know we be so complicated  
But we be so smitten it's crazy  
I can't have what I want but neither can you  
You ain't my boyfriend  
Boyfriend  
And I ain't your girlfriend  
Girlfriend  
But you don't want me to see nobody else  
And I don't want you to see nobody  
But you ain't my boyfriend  
Boyfriend  
And I ain't your girlfriend  
Girlfriend  
But you don't want me to touch nobody else  
Baby we ain't gotta tell nobody  
Even though you ain't mine I promise the way we fight  
Make me honestly feel like we just in love  
Baby when push comes to shove  
D**n baby I'm a train wreck too  
I lose my mind when it comes to you  
I take time with the ones I choose  
And I don't want to smile if it ain't from you yeah  
I know we be so complicated  
Lovin' you sometimes drive me crazy  
'Cause I can't have what I want and neither can you  
You ain't my boyfriend  
Boyfriend  
And I ain't your girlfriend  
Girlfriend  
But you don't want me to see nobody else  
And I don't want you to see nobody  
But you ain't my boyfriend  
Boyfriend  
And I ain't your girlfriend  
Girlfriend  
But you don't want me to touch nobody else  
Baby we ain't gotta tell nobody  
I wanna kiss you  
Yeah  
Don't wanna miss you  
Yeah  
But I can't be with you 'cause I got issues  
Yeah on the surface seem like it's easy  
Careful with words but it's still hard to read me  
Stress high when the trust low  
Bad vibes where'd the fun go  
Try to open up and love more  
Try to open up and love more  
If you were my boyfriend  
And you were my girlfriend  
I probably wouldn't see nobody else  
But I can't guarantee that by myself  
You ain't my boyfriend  
Boyfriend  
And I ain't your girlfriend  
Girlfriend  
But you don't want me to see nobody else  
And I don't want you to see nobody  
But you ain't my boyfriend  
Boyfriend  
And I ain't your girlfriend  
Girlfriend  
But you don't want me to touch nobody else  
Baby we ain't gotta tell nobody  
You ain't my boyfriend  
Boyfriend  
And I ain't your girlfriend  
Girlfriend  
But you don't want me to see nobody else  
And I don't want you to see nobody  
But you ain't my boyfriend  
Boyfriend  
And I ain't your girlfriend  
Girlfriend  
But you don't want me to touch nobody else  
Baby we ain't gotta tell nobody
