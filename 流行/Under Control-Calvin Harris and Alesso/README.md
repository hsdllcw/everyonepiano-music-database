### Under Control歌词：

I might be anyone I long for out in the sun  
Your heartbeat of solid gold  
I love you, you'll never know  
When the daylight comes  
You feel so cold, you know  
I'm too afraid of my heart to let you go  
Waiting for the fire to light  
A feeling like we could do right  
Be the one who makes tonight  
'Caus freedom is a lonely road  
Under Control  
Under Control  
I might be anyone I long for out in the sun  
Your heartbeat of solid gold  
I know  
When the daylight comes  
You feel so cold, you know  
I'm too afraid of my heart to let you go  
Waiting for the fire to light  
A feeling like we could do right  
Be the one who makes tonight  
'Caus freedom is a lonely road  
Under Control  
Waiting for the fire to light  
A feeling like we could do right  
Be the one who makes tonight  
'CauI might be anyone I long for out in the sun  
Your heartbeat of solid gold  
I love you, you'll never know  
When the daylight comes  
You feel so cold, you know  
I'm too afraid of my heart to let you go  
Waiting for the fire to light  
A feeling like we could do right  
Be the one who makes tonight

Waiting for the fire to light  
A feeling like we could do right  
Be the one who makes tonight  
'Cause freedom is a lonely roads freedom is a lonely road
