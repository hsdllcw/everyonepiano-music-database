### Love Again歌词：

Can we go back to how it was  
Before my pride got in-between us  
Go ahead and hit me where it hurts  
Because at least then I'll feel something  
Screaming in my face  
Kicked me out your place  
I got nowhere to go  
Can we find love again  
Is this time the end  
Tell me how many more tears will drop  
'Til you hit me with "Can we talk"  
And try love again  
Can we find love again  
Is this time the end  
Tell me how many more tears will drop  
'Til you hit me with "Can we talk"  
And try love again  
I crashed my car into a wall  
I tried to text I shoulda called  
Seen blue and red it won't be long  
Ooh uh  
We went to war it didn't end  
I bit my tongue you hit my chin  
Worst enemy is my best friend  
Ooh  
Screaming in my face  
Kicked me out your place  
I got nowhere to go  
Can we find love again  
Is this time the end  
Tell me how many more tears will drop  
'Til you hit me with "Can we talk"  
And try love again  
Can we find love again  
Is this time the end  
Tell me how many more tears will drop  
'Til you hit me with "Can we talk"  
And try love again
