### In This Together歌词：

Is it really over  
The echoes just seem to get longer  
How did we get here  
There was so much love in us  
And all I have left is my faith  
I can change  
I can't watch this burn  
I can't watch this burn to the ground  
You'd have thought we'd learn you'd have thought we'd learn by now  
I can hear the whole world singing together  
Together together  
I can hear the whole world sing  
It's now or never never never  
'Cause it's not too late if we change our ways  
And connect the dots to our problems  
I can hear the whole world sing  
We're in this together  
We're in this together  
Pickin' up the pieces  
I listen out for beating hearts  
And now it's time for healing  
The sun will rise but this time it's so bright  
And all I have left is my faith that we could change  
'Cause I can't watch us lose like  
I watch us lose what we found  
You'd have thought we'd learn you'd have thought we'd learn by now  
I can hear the whole world singing together together together  
I can hear the whole world sing  
It's now or never never never  
'Cause it's not too late if we change our ways  
And connect the dots to our problems  
I can hear the whole world sing  
We're in this together  
We're in this together together  
Oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-oh  
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  
Oh I can hear the whole world singing together  
And I can hear the whole world sing  
It's now or never  
'Cause it's not too late if we change our ways  
And connect the dots to our problems  
I can hear the whole world sing  
We're in this together  
We're in this together  
Ah-ooh-ooh-ooh  
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  
Ooh-ooh-ooh  
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
