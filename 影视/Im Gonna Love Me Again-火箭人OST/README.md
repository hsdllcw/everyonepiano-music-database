### (I'm Gonna) Love Me Again歌词：

Elton John：  
Oh the joke was never hard to tell  
Threw my fair change in the wishing well  
The dream alone is always in your hands  
If that don't fill the boy and build the man  
A heart has many secrets so I'm told  
Through the years a theory can grow cold  
I'm up to be the king it's gotten clear  
The voice inside my head is the one I hear  
Singing I'm gonna love me again  
Check in on my very best friend  
Find the will to fill my cells  
Rise above the broken rails  
Unbound by any ties that break or bend  
I'm free and don't you know  
No clown that claimed he used to know me then  
I'm free and don't you know  
And oh-oh-oh I'm gonna love me again  
Taron Egerton：  
The golden age was somehow bittersweet  
But now the past lies sleepin' in the deep  
The peaceful days that followed hollow nights  
A kiss or touch could feel like Kryptonite  
Praise the saints that hung up on my wall  
For trust is left in lovers after all  
A whispered word emergin' from a tale  
My wake-up call to claim the cursed spell  
Well I'm gonna love me again  
Check in on my very best friend  
Find the will to fill my cells  
Rise above the broken rails  
Unbound by any ties that break or bend  
I'm free and don't you know  
No clown that claimed he used to know me then  
I'm free and don't you know  
And oh-oh-oh I'm gonna love me again  
Sing I'm gonna love me again  
Check in on my very best friend  
Find the will to fill my cells  
Rise above the broken rails  
Unbound by any ties that break or bend  
I'm free and don't you know  
No clown that claimed he used to know me then  
I'm free don't you know  
And oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh I'm gonna love me again  
I'm gonna love me again  
I'm gonna love me again
