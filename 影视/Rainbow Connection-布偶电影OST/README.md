Rainbow Connection歌词：

  
Why are there so many songs about rainbows  
And what's on the other side  
Rainbows are visions  
But only illusions  
And rainbows have nothing to hide

So we've been told  
And some choose to believe it  
I know they're wrong, wait and see  
Some day we'll find it  
The rainbow connection  
The lovers, the dreamers, and me

Who said that every wish  
Would be heard and answered  
When wished on the morning star  
Somebody thought of that  
And someone believed it  
And look what it's done so far

What's so amazing  
That keeps us stargazing  
And what do we think we might see  
Some day we'll find it  
The rainbow connection  
The lovers, the dreamers, and me

All of us under its spell, we know that it's probably magic

Have you been half asleep?  
And have you heard voices?  
I've heard them calling my name  
Is this the sweet sound  
That called the young sailors?  
The voice might be one and the same

I've heard it too many times to ignore it  
It's something that I'm supposed to be  
Some day we'll find it  
The rainbow connection  
The lovers, the dreamers, and me

La da da di da da dum da duh da da dum di da
