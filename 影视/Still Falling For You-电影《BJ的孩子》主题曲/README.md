_Still Falling For You_ 是Ellie
Goulding为电影《BJ的孩子》献唱的主题曲。整首歌节奏欢快，旋律紧凑，充满了自信女性的光环。多听刷自信，哈哈。

Ellie以惊艳空灵的声音开唱，与无限激流中感受带来微妙情谊。听完她的歌会发现，一向将电音进行到底的“绵羊音”原来也可唱出磅礴大气。强烈的节奏感，狂野的魅力，神秘的热情，奔放的烈爱，时高时低，时重时轻的唱腔给人带来新鲜感。

### Still Falling For You歌词：

Fire and ice  
This love is like fire and ice  
This love is like rain and blue skies  
This love is like sun on the rise  
This love got me rolling the dice  
Don't let me lose  
Still falling for you  
Still falling for you  
Beautiful mind  
Your heart got a story with mine  
Your heart got me hurting at times  
Your heart gave me new kind of highs  
Your heart got me feeling so fine  
So what to do  
Still falling for you  
Still falling for you  
It took us a while  
With every breath a new day  
With love on the line  
We've had our share of mistakes  
But all your flaws and scars are mine  
Still falling for you  
Still falling for you  
And just like that  
All I breathe  
All I feel  
You are all for me  
I'm in  
And just like that  
All I breathe  
All I feel  
You are all for me  
No one can lift me catch me the way that you do  
I'm still falling for you  
Brighter than gold  
This love shining brighter than gold  
This love is like letters in bold  
This love is like out of control  
This love is never growing old  
You make it new  
Still falling for you  
Still falling for you  
It took us a while  
Because we were young and unsure  
With love on the line  
What if we both would need more  
But all your flaws and scars are mine  
Still falling for you  
Still falling for you  
Still falling for you  
And just like that  
All I breathe  
All I feel  
You are all for me  
I'm in  
And just like that  
All I breathe  
All I feel  
You are all for me  
No one can lift me catch me the way that you do  
I'm still falling for you  
Falling crash into my arms  
Love you like this  
Like a first kiss  
Never let go  
Falling crash into my arms  
Never breaking what we got  
Still falling for you  
Still falling for  
And just like that  
All I breathe  
All I feel  
You are all for me  
I'm in  
And just like that  
All I breathe  
All I feel  
You are all for me  
All for me  
And just like that  
All I feel is you  
All I feel is you  
You are all for me  
I'm still falling  
And just like that  
All I feel is you  
All I feel is you  
You are all for me  
No one can lift me catch me the way that you do  
I'm still falling for you
