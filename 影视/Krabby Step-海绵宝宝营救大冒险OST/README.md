### Krabby Step歌词：

Let me guess tiny a small salad  
I'll take a double triple party deluxe on a raft  
Four by four animal style  
Ayy big racks I need that  
Well done where the cheese at  
Ayy big flex believe that  
My friends got my back sheesh  
To the left to the left to the left  
Yay  
To the right to the right you're the best  
Yay  
Stand up stand up hands up  
Yay  
You're the best you're the best never give up  
Yay  
I'm flipping them patties I'm chillin' with Patrick  
Then both pull up backwards and they full of laughter  
See Sandy Cheeks I'm burstin' her bubble  
A jellyfish lover I'll catch me a couple  
Yeah  
A magical world the F is for fun  
I'd run to the sun if only I could  
Now turn to your neighbor to make sure they're swell  
I probably will be forever be young  
I'm feeling a little bit krabby  
How can I be happy when people are spending me money  
The barnacles blue in the morning I'm skipping outside  
And yeah I hope that it's sunny  
Aye aye Captain gettin' the check and I'm gettin' deposits  
Aye aye captain spark like a dolphin I'm duckin' the Dutchman  
To the left to the left to the left  
Yay  
To the right to the right you're the best  
Yay  
Stand up stand up hands up  
Yay  
You're the best you're the best never give up  
Yay  
Never wastin' my time  
Young still in my prime  
I got fun on my mind  
Pineapple on the side  
Starfish and I shine  
Yeah  
Friends coming outside real friends I got five  
Sandy Patrick it's a vibe  
Mrs. Puff let me drive  
Whippin' the boat I'm fine  
You good  
Hello Mrs. Puff  
Riding drop to top in Bikini Bottom  
Drop it  
Krabby Patties you know I got 'em  
I got 'em  
In the ocean you know I'm poppin'  
I'm poppin'  
And my pet Gary can't leave without him  
Yay  
To the left to the left to the left  
Yay  
To the right to the right you're the best  
Yay  
Stand up stand up hands up  
Yay  
You're the best you're the best never give up  
Yay  
Are you ready  
Aye Aye Captain  
I can't hear you  
Aye Aye Captain  
Ooh I hop in the boat and I roll in the sun  
No license but Mrs. Puff but she givin' it to me  
A beautiful day  
So jellyfish yeah we just caught like three  
But hold on  
Hold on  
We on a mission right now to find Gary he long gone  
All of my friends and we never get scared it's me and  
Spongebob Squarepants  
Squidward and Patrick and Sandy and

To the right to the right you're the best  
Yay

You're the best you're the best never give up  
Yay
