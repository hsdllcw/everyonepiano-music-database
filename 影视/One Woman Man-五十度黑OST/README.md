是美国环球影业出品的爱情片《五十度黑》的原声音乐。该片2017年2月10日在美国上映，讲述格雷希望安娜重新回到他身边，而安娜也不再只是被动接受，她也提出了自己的要求。就在两人重新投入恋情中时，格雷过去生活中发生的事情，像阴影一样笼罩在他们头顶上。

另外，此曲由John Legend演唱。John
Legend是一个学者型的灵魂乐歌者，他不仅只是一个歌手，更像是一个R&B音乐和灵魂乐的布道者，他与满大街的R&B和灵魂乐歌手的区别就在于，很多歌手可以因为R&B和灵魂乐风格不再时尚而转行，而John
Legend却会守着这些传统一路坚持下去。

### One Woman Man歌词：

I always believed that love will surrender  
And I wouldn't go down without a fight  
I always left room for other contenders  
'Cause I might change my mind  
Damn I used to be so cold  
We never ever get too close  
Didn't ever wanna lose control  
But from the moment that I tasted  
I knew that I would have to chase it  
You say hold up I won't you to be  
A one woman man  
A one woman man oh  
Want you all to my side  
Don't want nobody else  
Oh you love it  
Oh you love it  
Won't you be  
A one woman man one woman  
A one woman man oh one woman  
You made me believe that love was forever  
And love could sustain us through every fight  
I'll let go of all of the other  
Pretenders they'll be wasting my time  
I never thought that I would say this  
But I can see it haven Baby's  
I can see it from the stars  
That I might give you my heart  
From the moment that I met you  
Knew that I would never let you  
Slip away it's okay  
You can make me  
A one woman man  
A one woman man oh  
Want you all to my side  
Don't want nobody else  
Oh my love it  
Oh you love it  
Won't you be  
A one woman man one woman  
A one woman man uh one woman  
I can never say I loved you  
I kept all my  
But you broke in my house  
You've stolen my heart  
Now I'm giving you the key  
That all of you for all of me  
But baby I promise you'll be  
A one woman man oh  
Want you all to myself  
Don't want nobody else  
Oh I love it  
Oh they love it  
I can be  
A one woman man one woman  
A one woman man uh one woman
