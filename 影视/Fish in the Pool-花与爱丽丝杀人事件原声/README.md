### Fish in the Pool歌词：

Let me hear the sound of your heartbeat  
On my toes  
Let me touch my ear on your chest  
It rains cats and dogs  
I'm a little soaking mouse  
Here wet with a blanket of rain  
And I dream of you  
I don't like this time we have  
Cause I'm here afraid of when we lose it  
Can you hear the rain above  
It sounds like a tiny march of angels  
Please don't leave me here just watch me dance  
Pointé passé fouetté  
Whenever we meet it rains cats and dogs  
I'm a little soaking mouse  
I'm wet with a blanket of rain  
And I dream of you  
La la you know  
I knew you'd no longer be here when the summer was over  
And now I knew you'd be back without any words or hints  
It must be fate  
The world is a dream in rain  
The splashes of water shines don't you see  
Watch out  
Don't step on the fish in the pool  
I'm a little soaking mouse  
I'm wet with a blanket of rain  
And I dream of you  
Let me hear the sound of your heartbeat  
On my toes  
Let me touch my ear on your chest  
It rains cats and dogs  
I'm a little soaking mouse  
Here wet with a blanket of rain  
And I'm dreaming of you
