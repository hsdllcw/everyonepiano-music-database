### Blowin' In The Wind歌词：

How many roads must a man walk down  
Before you call him a man?  
How many seas must a white dove sail  
Before she sleeps in the sand?  
How many times must the cannon balls fly  
Before they're forever banned?

The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind  
The answer is blowin' in the wind.

How many years can a mountain exist  
Before it's washed to the sea?  
How many years can some people exist  
Before they're allowed to be free?  
How many times can a man turn his head  
And pretend that he just doesn't see?

The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind  
The answer is blowin' in the wind.

How many times must a man look up  
Before he can really see the sky?  
How many ears must one person have  
Before he can hear people cry?  
How many deaths will it take 'til he knows  
That too many people have died?

The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind  
The answer is blowin' in the wind.
