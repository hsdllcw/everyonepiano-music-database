### Second Chance歌词：

Who knew that love could be so bittersweet  
Oh when it finally meets the end  
But there is somethin' in this summer wind  
A moment to begin again  
I know that every time a door is shut  
A window opens up for me  
It's all wide open down this road I'm on  
I'm findin' who I want to be  
I've got a second chance to fly  
I've got a second chance to fall  
What can make the tide turn  
What can make the fire burn  
A second chance is all  
Was I a fool to read between the lines  
Did I misread the signs that much  
Who would've thought we'd come this far as friends  
Maybe that should've been enough  
Maybe I'm safer when I'm on the run  
No time to open up my heart  
Maybe I'll hide behind my walls again  
Instead of tearing them apart  
I've got a second chance to fly a chance to fly  
I've got a second chance to fall a chance to fall  
What can make the tide turn  
What can make the fire burn  
A second chance is all  
I'm finding who I wanna be begin  
Who I wanna be begin  
I'm safer when I'm on the run  
I've got a second chance to fly  
I've got a second chance to fall  
What can make the tide turn  
What can make the fire burn  
A second chance is all  
I've got a second chance to fly  
I've got a second chance to fall  
I wonder what can make the tide turn  
What can make the fire burn  
A second chance is all  
I'm finding who I wanna be  
I'm finding who I wanna be  
A second chance is all
