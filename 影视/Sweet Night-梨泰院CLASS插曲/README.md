**Sweet Night双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Sweet Night_ 是由韩国流行男团防弹少年团成员V（金泰亨）录唱的一首歌曲，亦是JTBC电视剧《梨泰院Class》的原声作品之一。

此曲是以Acoustic Sound为基础的INDIE Pop。 以不插电吉他为基础，后半部出现的V的哼唱和小提琴所构成的和谐音韵令人刮目相看。
就像歌曲《Sweet Night》的题目一样，这首歌表达了希望能给跌入无尽痛苦的夜晚的朴世路带去甜蜜夜晚的安慰

### Sweet Night歌词：

On my pillow  
Can't get me tired  
Sharing my fragile truth  
That I still hope the door is open  
Cuz the window  
Opened one time with you and me  
Now my forever's falling down  
Wondering if you'd want me now  
How could I know  
One day I'd wake up feeling more  
But I had already reached the shore  
Guess we were ships in the night  
Night night  
We were ships in the night night night  
I'm wondering  
Are you my best friend  
Feel's like a river's rushing through my mind  
I wanna ask you  
If this is all just in my head  
My heart is pounding tonight  
I wonder  
If you  
Are too good to be true  
And would it be alright if I  
Pulled you closer  
How could I know  
One day I'd wake up feeling more  
But I had already reached the shore  
Guess we were ships in the night  
Night night  
We were ships in the night  
Night night
