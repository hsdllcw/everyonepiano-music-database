### The Night We Met歌词：

Ohoo  
Ohoo  
Ohoo  
Ohoo  
I am not the only traveler  
Who has not repaid his debt  
I've been searching for a trail to follow again  
Take me back to the night we met  
And then I can tell myself  
What the hell I'm supposed to do  
And then I can tell myself  
Not to ride along with you  
I had all and then most of you  
Some and now none of you  
Take me back to the night we met  
I don't know what I'm supposed to do  
Haunted by the ghost of you  
Oh take me back to the night we met  
When the night was full or terror  
And your eyes were filled with tears  
When you had not touched me yet  
Oh take me back to the night we met  
I had all and then most of you  
Some and now none of you  
Take me back to the night we met  
I don't know what I'm supposed to do  
Haunted by the ghost of you  
Take me back to the night we met
