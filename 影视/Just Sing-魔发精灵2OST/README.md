_Just Sing_
是影片《魔发精灵2：世界之旅》的插曲。2020年3月22日据外媒报道，环球影业对《魔发精灵2》进行院线和线上同步发行的策略，引起了电影院方面的不满。美国影院业主协会主席John
Fithian在接受外媒采访时，谈及了新冠肺炎疫情下的美国影院现状。他着重谈到了各大电影公司对新片采取的策略：未上映新片推迟上映，已上映的院线新片提前开放在线点播。他对此表示理解，但唯一不满的是环球影业对《魔发精灵2》的安排。《魔发精灵2》将按原档期（4月10日）在北美上映，并在同天开放在线点播，John
Fithian表示“院线不会忘记这件事”。

### Just Sing歌词：

Let me hear you sing  
Sing it together  
Louder than ever  
Forget everything  
Just sing  
Like it's what we've been missin'  
And they're gonna listen listen  
Forget everything  
Just sing  
You think you've gotta hide it  
Don't keep it on the shelf  
Let your waist start movin'  
Watch the way I do it do it  
See me do it like nobody else  
If we sing it all together  
If we sing it all as one  
It's louder than yourself  
All together everyone  
Everybody's lookin'  
Watch the way we do it do it  
'Cause we do it like nobody else  
Let me hear you sing  
Don't you stop it don't you fight it  
Let me hear you sing  
If you got it can't deny it  
Let me hear ya  
It's waitin' for ya already  
You know that you do it like nobody else  
Just sing  
Sing it together  
Louder than ever ever  
Forget everything  
Just sing  
Like it's what we've been missin'  
And they're gonna listen listen  
Forget everything  
Let me hear ya  
Hey I been right here where you standin'  
I've been standin' on the ground  
And the walls are cavin' in  
All the walls are fallin'  
But my lips start movin'  
With the soul I put into it  
And you've never heard it done like this  
Let me hear you sing  
It's waitin' for ya already  
You know that you do it like nobody else  
Just sing  
Sing it together  
Louder than ever ever  
Forget everything  
Just sing  
Like it's what we've been missin'  
And they're gonna listen listen  
Forget everything  
Let me hear you sing  
Let me hear you  
Let me hear you sing  
Let me hear you sing  
Let me hear you  
Let me hear you sing  
It's waitin' for ya already  
You know that you do it like nobody else  
Just sing  
Sing it together  
Louder than ever ever  
Forget everything  
Just sing  
Like it's what we've been missin'  
And they're gonna listen listen  
Forget everything  
Just sing  
Sing it together  
Louder than ever ever  
Forget everything  
Just sing  
Like it's what we've been missin'  
And they're gonna listen listen  
Forget everything  
Just sing
