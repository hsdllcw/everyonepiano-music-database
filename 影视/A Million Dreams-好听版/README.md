### A Million Dreams歌词：

I close my eyes and I can see  
The world that's waiting up for me  
That I call my own  
Through the dark through the door  
Through where no one's been before  
But it feels like home  
They can say they can say it all sounds crazy  
They can say they can say I've lost my mind  
I don't care I don't care so call me crazy  
We can live in a world that we design  
'Cause every night I lie in bed  
The brightest colors fill my head  
A million dreams are keeping me awake  
I think of what the world could be  
A vision of the one I see  
A million dreams is all it's gonna take  
A million dreams for the world we're gonna make  
There's a house we can build  
Every room inside is filled  
With things from far away  
The special things I compile  
Each one there to make you smile  
On a rainy day  
They can say they can say it all sounds crazy  
They can say they can say we've lost our minds  
I don't care I don't care if they call us crazy  
Runaway to a world that we design  
Every night I lie in bed  
The brightest colors fill my head  
A million dreams are keeping me awake  
I think of what the world could be  
A vision of the one I see  
A million dreams is all it's gonna take  
A million dreams for the world we're gonna make  
However big however small  
Let me be part of it all  
Share your dreams with me  
You may be right you may be wrong  
But say that you'll bring me along  
To the world you see  
To the world I close my eyes to see  
I close my eyes to see  
Every night I lie in bed  
The brightest colors fill my head  
A million dreams are keeping me awake  
A million dreams a million dreams  
I think of what the world could be  
A vision of the one I see  
A million dreams is all it's gonna take  
A million dreams for the world we're gonna make  
For the world we're gonna make
