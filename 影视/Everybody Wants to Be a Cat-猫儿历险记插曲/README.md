### Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat歌词：

Everybody wants to be a cat  
Because a cat's the only cat  
Who knows where it's at  
Everybody's pickin' up on that feline beat  
'Cause everything else is obsolete  
Now a square with a horn  
Can make you wish you weren't born  
Ever'time he plays  
And with a square in the act  
You can set music back  
To the caveman days  
I've heard some corny birds who tried to sing  
But still a cat's the only cat  
Who knows how to swing  
Who wants to dig  
A long-haired gig  
Or stuff like that  
When everybody wants to be a cat  
A square with that horn  
Makes you wish you weren't born  
Ever'time he plays  
With a square in the act  
You can set this music back  
To the caveman days  
Everybody wants to be a cat  
Because a cat's the only cat  
Who knows where it's at  
While playin' jazz she's always  
Welcome back to mat  
'Cause everybody digs a swingin' in cat  
I want you to know  
I want you to know  
Beware of a square  
When he offers to share  
His milk to sip  
If it hasn't been tried  
I suggest you provide  
Your own catnip  
Everybody wants to be a cat  
Because a cat's the only cat  
Who knows where it's at  
Who knows where it's at  
Everybody's pickin' up on that feline beat  
'Cause everybody wants to be a cat  
Be a cat  
Be a cat  
Listen up  
I mean all your felines to meet me at the fronty of the stage  
Welcome to the sleep cat cafe baby  
Everybody  
Everybody  
Everybody  
Everybody  
Everybody  
Everybody  
Everybody  
Everybody  
Everybody  
Everybody  
Everybody
