Sia，澳大利亚流行女歌手、词曲作者，毕业于阿德莱德高中。她的嗓音有种扭曲的质感，沙哑时像刀锉，嗞嗞作响，高音嘹亮引人入胜，即便有几个小破音，也成了歌中真挚情感的佐料，再加上澳洲人独特的英语发音，让她的歌声别具一格。而Sia随意慵懒的唱腔，像把急速的城市节奏重新调整，也恰好反映了她不想做巨星的真实心情。

### Rainbow歌词：

I know you  
You're a special one  
Some see crazy where I see love  
You fall so long  
But soar so high  
Big dreamer shoot for open sky  
So much life in those open eyes  
So much depth you look forward to life  
When your wounds open  
You will cry  
Cry oh no and you'll question why  
I can see a rainbow  
In your tears as they're fallin' down  
I can see your soul grow uoo  
Through the pain as they hit the ground  
I can see a rainbow  
In your tears as the sun comes out  
As the sun comes out  
I am here  
And I see your pain  
Through the storms  
Through the clouds the rain  
I'm telling you  
You cannot escape  
You can do it  
Just feel baby  
I can see a rainbow  
In your tears as they're fallin' down  
I can see your soul grow uoo  
Through the pain as they hit the ground  
I can see a rainbow  
In your tears as the sun comes out  
As the sun comes out  
Here comes the sun  
Smiling down  
Here comes the sun  
Smiling down  
Here comes the sun  
Smiling now  
Smiling now  
I can see a rainbow  
In your tears as they're fallin' down  
I can see your soul grow uoo  
Through the pain as they hit the ground  
I can see a rainbow  
In your tears as the sun comes out  
As the sun comes out  
I can see a rainbow  
In your tears as they're fallin' down  
I can see your soul grow uoo  
Through the pain as they hit the ground  
I can see a rainbow  
In your tears as the sun comes out  
As the sun comes out
