### Is There Still Anything That Love Can Do歌词：

Born with nothing in my hands  
I stumbled upon this place  
Falling through a crack in time  
I was writhing in pain  
When those who make it in this age  
Are only those who learn how to take  
And everyone is giving up  
Where do we all take a breath?  
Governors and gods alike  
Try to turn the other cheek  
But even if you look away  
The truth is always facing you  
Courage and the strength of hope  
The magical bond we share  
We grow up only to forget  
How we ever used them here  
But same as you were on that day  
I see you still standing there  
Glowing in your innocence  
You were always standing there  
When the world turns its back on you  
You find a way to stand and fight  
Ready to face it all  
I see you here, shining bright  
I need to know  
If there's still anything that love can do?  
I need to know  
If there's still anything that I can do?  
You are the one who found  
My courage and I knew  
I wanna pay it back and spend it all on you  
You gave me love, we share  
It's all because of you  
You are the reason  
Let me share this love with you  
I need to know  
If there's still anything that love can do?  
I need to know  
If there's still anything that I can do?  
What if our destiny  
Was just a roll of the dice  
Or if it's up to the Gods?  
And if they feel like playing nice  
A mission that we didn't choose  
Like armor that we can't remove  
Or maybe it's a distant wish?  
Something that we can't refuse  
Prayers that are never heard  
Reunions that never occur  
Arguments that never clear  
Hate that doesn't disappear  
I hear the voices that forgive  
I see them standing hand in hand  
But with its arms open wide  
The earth embraces all again  
I need to know  
If there's still anything that love can do?  
I need to know  
If there's still anything that I can do?  
You are the one who found  
My courage and I knew  
I wanna pay it back and spend it all on you  
This love we raised together  
Shaped by me and you  
You are the reason  
Let me live this love with you  
I need to know  
If there's still anything that love can do?  
I need to know  
If there's still anything that I can do?  
So insignificant just you and me  
So why were we given this dream?  
And if this life is just going to end  
Tell me, why were we allowed to feel hope?  
And if it's just gonna slip out of my hands  
Then why even give it to me?  
'Cause ain't it sad how we try to hold on  
Knowing one day, it'll be gone  
Or maybe it's beautiful?  
Answer me!  
All these love songs we hear  
Already, they've been sung to death  
All the movies that we've seen  
They said everything they can  
But somehow you and me  
Fell into this wilderness  
But still, I need to know  
I need to know  
If there's still anything that love can do?  
I need to know  
If there's still anything that I can do?
