### One Last Time歌词：

Mr President you asked to see me  
I know you're busy  
What do you need sir  
Sir  
I wanna give you a word of warning  
Sir I don't know what you heard  
But whatever it is Jefferson started it  
Thomas Jefferson resigned this morning  
You're kidding  
I need a favor  
Whatever you say sir Jefferson will pay for his behavior  
Shh talk less  
I'll use the press  
I'll write under a pseudonym you'll see what I can do to him  
I need you to draft an address  
Yes he resigned  
You can finally speak your mind  
No he's stepping down so he can run for President  
Ha Good luck defeating you sir  
I'm stepping down I'm not running for President  
I'm sorry what  
One last time  
Relax have a drink with me  
One last time  
Let's take a break tonight  
And then we'll teach them how to say goodbye  
To say goodbye  
You and I  
No sir why  
I wanna talk about neutrality  
Sir with Britain and France on the verge of war is this the best time  
I want to warn against partisan fighting  
But  
Pick up a pen start writing  
I wanna talk about what I have learned  
The hard-won wisdom I have earned  
As far as the people are concerned  
You have to serve you could continue to serve  
No one last time  
The people will hear from me  
One last time  
And if we get this right  
We're gonna teach 'em how to say  
Goodbye  
You and I  
Mr President they will say you're weak  
No they will see we're strong  
Your position is so unique  
So I'll use it to move them along  
Why do you have to say goodbye  
If I say goodbye the nation learns to move on  
It outlives me when I'm gone  
Like the scripture says  
Everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree  
And no one shall make them afraid  
They'll be safe in the nation we've made  
I wanna sit under my own vine and fig tree  
A moment alone in the shade  
At home in this nation we've made  
One last time  
One last time  
Though in reviewing the incidents of my administration  
I am unconscious of intentional error  
I am nevertheless too sensible of my defects not  
To think it probable that I may have committed many errors  
I shall also carry with me  
The hope  
That my country will  
View them with indulgence  
And that  
After forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service with an upright
zeal  
The faults of incompetent abilities will be  
Consigned to oblivion as I myself must soon be to the mansions of rest  
I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat in which  
I promise myself to realize the sweet enjoyment of partaking  
In the midst of my fellow-citizens  
The benign influence of good laws  
Under a free government the ever-favorite object of my heart  
And the happy reward as I trust  
Of our mutual cares labors and dangers  
One last time  
George Washington's going home  
Teach 'em how to say goodbye  
George Washington's going home  
You and I  
George Washington's going home  
Going home  
George Washington's going home  
History has its eyes on you  
George Washington's going home  
We're gonna teach 'em how to  
Say goodbye  
Teach 'em how to  
Say goodbye  
To say goodbye  
Say goodbye  
One last time
