### Goodbye歌词：

So long goodbye  
I'll see you when I see you  
You can pick the street  
I'll meet you on the other side  
So long goodbye  
Do I really have to finish  
Do returns always diminish  
Did I say that right  
Does anybody want to joke  
When no one's laughing in the background  
So this is how it ends  
I promise to never go outside again  
So long bye  
I'm slowly losing power  
Has it only been an hour  
No that can't be right  
So long goodbye  
Hey here's a fun idea  
How 'bout I sit on the couch  
And I watch you next time  
I wanna hear you tell a joke  
When no one's laughing in the background  
So this is how it ends  
I promise to never go outside again  
Am I going crazy  
Would I even know  
Am I right back where I started fourteen years ago  
Wanna guess the ending if it ever does  
I swear to God that all I've ever wanted was  
A little bit of everything all of the time  
A bit of everything all of the time  
Apathy's a tragedy and boredom is a crime  
I'm finished playing and I'm staying inside  
If I wake up in a house that's full of smoke  
I'll panic so call me up and tell me a joke  
When I'm fully irrelevant and totally broken  
Dammit call me up and tell me a joke  
Oh s**t you're really joking at a time like this  
Well well look who's inside again  
Went out to look for a reason to hide again  
Well well buddy you found it  
Now come out with your hands up we've got you surrounded
