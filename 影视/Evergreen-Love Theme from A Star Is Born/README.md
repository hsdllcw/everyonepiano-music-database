### Evergreen歌词：

Love soft as an easy chair  
Love fresh as the morning air  
One love that is shared by two  
I have found with you  
Like a rose under the April snow  
I was always certain love would grow  
Love ageless and evergreen  
Seldom seen by two  
You and I will  
Make each night the first  
Everyday a beginning  
Spirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed  
They warm and excite us  
'Cause we have the brightest love  
Two lights that shine as one Morning glory and midnight sun  
Time we've learned to sail above  
Time won't change the meaning of one love  
Ageless and ever evergreen
