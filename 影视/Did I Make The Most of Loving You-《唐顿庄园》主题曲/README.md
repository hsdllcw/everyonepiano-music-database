### Did I Make The Most of Loving You歌词：

Did I make the most of loving you?  
So many things we didn’t do.  
Did I give you all my heart could give?  
Two unlived lives with lives to live.  
When these endless, lonely days are through,  
I’ll make the most of loving you.  
I’ll make the most of loving you.  
Did we make the most of all we had?  
Not seeing you makes my heart sad.  
Did we make the most of summer days?  
We still have time to change our ways.  
When these endless, lonely days are through,  
I’ll make the most of loving you.  
I’ll make the most of loving you.  
I’ll make the most of loving you.  
I’ll make the most of loving you.  
Did those tender words stay in my head?  
So many things were left unsaid.  
Did I give you all my heart could give?  
Two unlived lives with lives to live.  
When these endless, lonely days are through,  
I’ll make the most of loving you.  
I’ll make the most of loving you.  
I’ll make the most of loving you.  
I’ll make the most of loving you.
