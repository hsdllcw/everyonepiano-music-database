### You’ll Be in My Heart歌词：

Come stop your crying  
It will be alright  
Just take my hand  
Hold it tight  
I will protect you  
From all around you  
I will be here  
Don't you cry  
For one so small  
You seem so strong  
My arms will hold you  
Keep you safe and warm  
This bond between us  
Can't be broken  
I will be here  
Don't you cry  
Cause you'll be in my heart  
Yes you'll be in my heart  
From this day on  
Now and forever more  
You'll be in my heart  
No matter what they say  
You'll be here in my heart  
Always  
Why can't they understand the way we feel  
They just don't trust what they can't explain  
I know we're different but deep inside us  
We're not that different at all  
And you'll be in my heart  
Yes you'll be in my heart  
From this day on  
Now and forever more  
Don't listen to them  
'Cause what do they know  
We need each other to have to hold  
They'll see in time I know  
When destiny calls you you must be strong  
I may not be with you  
But you've got to hold on  
They'll see in time I know  
We'll show them together  
Cause you'll be in my heart  
Believe me you'll be in my heart  
I'll be there from this day on  
Now and forever more  
You'll be in my heart  
You'll be here in my heart  
No matter what they say  
I'll be with you  
You'll be here in my heart  
I'll be there  
Always  
Always I'll be with you  
I'll be there for you always  
Always and always  
Just look over your shoulder  
Just look over your shoulder  
Just look over your shoulder  
I'll be there  
Always
