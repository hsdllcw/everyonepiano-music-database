### Enemy歌词：

Look out for yourself  
I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows  
For my mind to run around with my ear up to the ground  
I'm searching to behold the stories that are told  
When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned  
Tell you you're the greatest  
But once you turn they hate us  
Oh the misery  
Everybody wants to be my enemy  
Spare the sympathy  
Everybody wants to be  
My enemy  
Look out for yourself  
My enemy  
Look out for yourself  
But I'm ready  
Your words up on the wall as you're praying for my fall  
And the laughter in the halls and the names that I've been called  
I stack it in my mind and I'm waiting for the time  
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic  
Tell you you're the greatest  
But once you turn they hate us  
Oh the misery  
Everybody wants to be my enemy  
Spare the sympathy  
Everybody wants to be  
My enemy  
Look out for yourself  
My enemy  
Look out for yourself  
Look Okay  
I'm hoping that somebody pray for me  
I'm praying that somebody hope for me  
I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be P-p-posted  
Being a wreck of emotions  
Ready to go whenever just let me know  
The road is long so put the pedal into the floor  
The enemy's on my trail my energy unavailable  
Imma tell 'em hasta luego  
They wanna plot on my trot to the top  
I've been outta shape thinkin' out the box  
I'm an astronaut I blasted off the planet rock  
To cause Catastrophe and it matters more because I had it not  
Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition  
Kinda shockin' they wanted static with precision I'm automatic quarterback  
I ain't talkin' sacking pack it pack it up I don't panic batter batter up  
Who the baddest it don't matter cause we at ya throat  
Everybody wants to be my enemy  
Spare the sympathy  
Everybody wants to be  
My enemy  
Oh the misery  
Everybody wants to be my enemy  
Spare the sympathy  
Everybody wants to be  
My enemy  
Pray it away I swear I'll never be a saint no way  
My enemy  
Pray it away I swear I'll never be a saint  
Look out for yourself
