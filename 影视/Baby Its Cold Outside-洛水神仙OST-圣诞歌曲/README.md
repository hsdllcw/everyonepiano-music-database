### Baby, It's Cold Outside歌词：

Baby it's cold outside  
I really can't stay  
But baby it's cold outside  
I Got to go away  
But baby it's cold outside  
This evening has been  
Been hoping you'd drop in  
So very nice  
I'll hold your hands they're just like ice  
My mother will start to worry  
Beautiful watch you're wearing  
My father will be pacing the floor  
Listen to the fireplace roar  
So really I'd better scurry  
Beautiful please don't hurry  
Well maybe just a half a drink more  
Put some records on while I pour  
The neighbors might think  
Baby it's bad out there  
Say what's in this drink  
No cabs to be had out there  
I wish I knew how  
Your eyes are like starlight now  
To break this spell  
I'll take your hat your hair looks swell  
I ought to say no no sir  
Mind if closerI move in  
At least I'm going to say that I tried  
What's the sense of hurting my pride  
I really can't stay  
Baby don't hold out  
Baby it's cold outside  
I simply must go  
Baby it's cold outside  
The answer is no  
Baby it's cold outside  
The welcome has been  
How lucky that you dropped in  
So nice and warm  
Look out the window at the storm  
My sister will be suspicious  
Gosh your lips look delicious  
My brother will be there at the door  
Waves upon a tropical shore  
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious  
Gosh your lips are delicious  
But maybe just a cigarette more  
Never such a blizzard before  
I got to get home  
But baby you'd freeze out there  
Say lend me a comb  
It's up to your knees out there  
You've really been grand  
I thrill when you touch my hand  
But don't you see  
How can you do this thing to me  
There's bound to be talk tomorrow  
Think of my life long sorrow  
At least there will be plenty implied  
If you caught pneumonia and died  
（I really can't stay  
Get over that old doubt  
Baby it's cold  
Get no it's cold outside
