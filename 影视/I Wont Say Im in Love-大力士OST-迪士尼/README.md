### I Won't Say (I'm in Love)歌词：

If there's a prize for rotten judgment  
I guess, I've already won that  
No man is worth the aggravation  
That's ancient history, been there, done that  
Who do you think you're kiddin'?  
He's the earth and heaven to you  
Try to keep it hidden  
Honey, we can see right through you  
Girl, you can't conceal it  
We know how you feel and  
Who you're thinking of?  
No chance, no way  
I won't say it, no, no  
You swoon, you sigh  
Why deny it? Uh, oh  
It's too cliche  
I won't say I'm in love  
I thought my heart had learned its lesson  
It feels so good when you start out  
My head is screaming, get a grip, girl  
Unless you're dying to cry your heart out, oh  
You keep on denying  
Who you are and how you're feeling?  
Baby, we're not buying  
Hon, we saw you hit the ceiling  
Face it like a grown up  
When you gonna own up  
That you got, got, got it bad  
No chance, now way  
I won't say it, no, no  
Give up, give in  
Check the grin you're in love  
This scene won't play  
I won't say I'm in love  
You're doin' flips read our lips  
You're in love  
You're way off base  
I won't say it  
Get off my case  
I won't say it  
Girl, don't be proud  
It's okay, you're in love  
At least out loud  
I won't say I'm in love
