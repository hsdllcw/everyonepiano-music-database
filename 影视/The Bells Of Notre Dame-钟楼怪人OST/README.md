### The Bells Of Notre Dame歌词：

Morning in Paris the city awakes  
To the bells of Notre Dame  
The fisherman fishes the bakerman bakes  
To the bells of Notre Dame  
To the big bells as loud as the thunder  
To the little bells soft as a psalm  
And some say the soul of the city's  
The toll of the bells  
The bells of Notre Dame  
Listen they're beautiful no  
So many colors of sound so many changing moods  
Because you know they don't ring all by themselves  
They don't  
No silly boy  
Up there high high in the dark bell tower  
Lives the mysterious bell ringer  
Who is this creature  
Who  
What is he  
What  
How did he come to be there  
How  
Hush and clopin will tell you  
It is a tale a tale of a man and a monster  
Dark was the night when our tale was begun  
On the docks near Notre Dame  
Shup it up will you  
We'll be spotted  
Hush little one  
Four frightened gypsies slid silently under  
The docks near Notre Dame  
Four guilders for safe passage into Paris  
But a trap had been laid for the gypsies  
And they gazed up in fear and alarm  
At a figure whose clutches  
Were iron as much as the bells  
Judge Claude Frollo  
The bells of Notre Dame  
Jehan Jehan lord have mercy  
Judge Claude Frollo longed  
To purge the world  
Of vice and sin  
Jehan Jehan lord have mercy  
And he saw corruption  
Ev'rywhere  
Except within'  
Bring these gypsy vermin to the palace of justice  
You there what are you hiding  
Stolen goods no doubt take them from her  
She ran  
Dies irae dies illa day of wrath that day  
Solvet saeclum in favilla shall consume the world in ashes  
Teste David cum sibylla as prophesied by David and the sibyl  
Quantus tremor est futurus what trembling is to be  
Quando judex est venturus when the judge is come  
Sanctuary please give us sanctuary  
A baby a monster  
Archdeacon  
Stop  
Cried the archdeacon  
This is an unholy deamon  
I'm sending it back to hell where it belongs  
See there the innocent blood you have spilt  
On the steps of Notre Dame  
I am guiltless she ran I pursued  
Now you would add this child's blood to your guilt  
On the steps of Notre Dame  
My conscience is clear  
You can lie to yourself and your minions  
You can claim that you haven't a qualm  
But you never can run from  
Nor hide what you've done from the eyes  
The very eyes of Notre Dame  
Jehan Jehan lord have mercy  
And for one time in his live  
Of power and control  
Jehan Jehan lord have mercy  
Frollo felt a twinge of fear  
For his immortal soul  
What must I do  
Care for the child and raise it as your own  
What I'd be settled with this misshapen  
Very well let him live with you in your church  
Live here where  
Anywhere  
Just so he's kept locked away  
Where no one else can see  
The bell tower perhaps  
And who knows our lord works in mysterious ways  
Even this foul creature may  
Yet prove one day to be  
Of use to me  
And Frollo gave the child a cruel name  
A name that means half formed quasimodo  
Now here is a riddle to guess if you can  
Sing the bells of Notre Dame  
Who is the monster and who is the man  
Sing the bells bells bells bells  
Bells bells bells bells  
Bells of Notre Dame
