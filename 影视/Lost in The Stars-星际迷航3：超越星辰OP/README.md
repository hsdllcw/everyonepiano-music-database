### Lost in the Stars歌词：

It's a big world  
And it's so full of love  
Round and round  
Can't seem to get enough  
Of the thrill  
Hope the fun last forever forever  
Can't you feel  
The force pull us together together  
Turn it up  
Let the music take you high  
Feel the love  
Put your hearts up to the sky  
Every time that the music plays  
It's a sweet escape  
When you feel this way  
You know it's right  
When the music plays  
It's a sweet escape  
When you feel this way  
You know it's right  
Live your life  
No need to dim your light  
Don't think twice  
When it feels alright  
Let's get lost in the stars  
And dance on the moon tonight tonight  
Let's get lost in the stars  
And dance on the moon tonight tonight  
Turn it up  
Let the music take you high  
Feel the love  
Put your hearts up to the sky  
Every time that the music plays  
It's a sweet escape  
When you feel this way  
You know it's right  
When the music plays  
It's a sweet escape  
When you feel this way  
You know it's right  
I could be your star  
So bright just shinning through the night  
I'll take you far so far  
Just find your love  
I'll go to Mars Mars  
Tonight wishing that you'll be my star my star  
For the whole night  
Just be my star ohh  
You'll be a star ohh  
I'll take you far ohh  
Just be my star ohh  
Turn it up  
Let the music take you high  
Feel the love  
Put your hearts up to the sky  
Every time that the music plays  
It's a sweet escape  
When you feel this way  
You know it's right  
When the music plays  
It's a sweet escape  
When you feel this way  
You know it's right
