### SET A FIRE歌词：

Sorry I'm still in a pain  
All words still unspoken  
Let my pain I'm counting word  
She say  
Say be mine I'm always be by  
Sying  
Your side  
Set a fire  
Set a fire  
Dying my heart  
No matter where you are  
Don't tell lies  
Who is liar  
You are in my heart  
No matter where you are  
Come set a fire  
Where did I what did I do you wrong  
Where did I what did I do you wrong  
Where did I what did I do you wrong  
For long did when I how did when I live  
This lonley world  
Let your hands on me  
Coming trust me  
I'm your hands  
So your heart to me  
Come and dance with me  
I'm boro babos your hands  
Set a fire  
Set a fire  
Dying my heart  
No matter where you are  
Don't tell lies  
Who is liar  
You are in my heart  
No matter where you are  
Come set a fire
