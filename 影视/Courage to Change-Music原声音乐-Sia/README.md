Sia新曲“ **Courage to Change** ”
于2020年9月24日上线，歌曲为Sia自编自导新片“Music”的主题曲，本片讲述了一个患有自闭症的少女Music发觉自己正在被以贩
DU为生的姐姐Zu（凯特•哈德森扮演）所悉心照料的故事。

非常励志且具有Sia姐强烈个人风格的一首歌。Sia的嗓音有种扭曲的质感，沙哑时像刀锉，嗞嗞作响，高音嘹亮引人入胜，即便有几个小破音，也成了歌中真挚情感的佐料，再加上澳洲人独特的英语发音，让她的歌声别具一格。

### Courage to Change歌词：

World I want to leave you better  
I want my life to matter  
I am afraid I have no purpose here  
I watch the news on TV  
Abandon myself daily  
I am afraid to let you see the real me  
Rain it falls rain it falls  
Pouring on me  
And the rain it falls rain it falls  
Sowing the seeds of love and hope love and hope  
We don't have to stay here stuck in the weeds  
Have I the courage to change  
Have I the courage to change  
Have I the courage to change today  
Have I the courage to change  
Have I the courage to change  
Have I the courage to change today  
You're not alone in all this  
You're not alone I promise  
Standing together we can do anything  
You're not alone in all this  
You're not alone I promise  
Standing together we can do anything  
World you're not alone in all this  
You're not alone I promise  
Standing together we can do anything  
I want to leave you better  
I want my life to matter  
I am afraid I have no purpose here  
The rain it falls rain it falls  
Pouring on me  
And the rain it falls rain it falls  
Sowing the seeds of love and hope love and hope  
You don't have to stay here stuck in the weeds  
Have I the courage to change  
Have I the courage to change  
Have I the courage to change today  
Have I the courage to change  
Have I the courage to change  
Have I the courage to change today  
You're not alone in all this  
You're not alone I promise  
Standing together we can do anything  
You're not alone in all this  
You're not alone I promise  
Standing together we can do anything  
Have I the courage to change  
Have I the courage to change  
Have I the courage to change today  
Have I the courage to change  
Have I the courage to change  
Have I the courage to change today  
You're not alone in all this  
You're not alone I promise  
Standing together we can do anything  
You're not alone in all this  
You're not alone I promise  
Standing together we can do anything  
You're not alone in all this  
You're not alone I promise  
Standing together we can do anything  
You're not alone in all this  
You're not alone I promise  
Standing together we can do anything
