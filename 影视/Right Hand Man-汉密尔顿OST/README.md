### Right Hand Man歌词：

British admiral howe's got troops on the water  
Thirty-two thousand troops in New York harbour  
Thirty-two thousand troops in New York harbour  
Thirty-two thousand troops in New York harbour  
When they surround our troops  
They surround our troops they surround our troops  
As a kid in the Caribbean I wished for a war  
I knew that I was poor I knew it was the only way to  
Rise up if they tell my story  
I am either gonna die on the battlefield in glory or  
Rise up I will fight for this land but there's only one man  
Who can give us a command so we can  
Rise up understand it's the only way to rise up rise up  
Here he comes  
Here comes the general  
Ladies and gentlemen  
Here comes the general  
The moment you've been waiting for  
Here comes the general  
The pride of mount Vernon  
Here comes the general  
George Washington  
We are out-gunned what  
Out-manned what  
Out-numbered out-planned buck buck buck buck  
Buck  
We gotta make an all-out stand  
Hey yo I'm gonna need a right-hand man buck buck buck buck  
Buck  
Check it  
Can I be real a second for just a millisecond  
Let down my guard and tell the people how I feel a second  
Now I'm the model of a modern major general  
The venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all  
Lining up to put me up on a pedestal writing letters to relatives  
Embellishing my elegance and eloquence  
But the elephant is in the room the truth is in your face  
When you hear the British cannons go boom  
Any hope of success is fleeting  
How can I keep leading when the people I'm leading keep retreating  
We put a stop to the bleeding as the British take Brooklyn  
Knight takes rook but look  
We are out-gunned what  
Out-manned what  
Out-numbered out-planned buck buck buck buck  
Buck  
We gotta make an all-out stand  
Ayo I'm gonna need a right-hand man buck buck buck buck  
Buck  
Incoming  
They're battering down the battery check the damages brrah  
We gotta stop em and rob em of their advantages brrah  
Let's take a stand with the stamina god has granted us  
Hamilton won't abandon ship yo let's steal their cannons  
Shh-boom  
Boom goes the cannon watch the blood and the sh*t spray and  
Boom goes the cannon we're abandoning kips bay and  
Boom there's another ship and  
Boom we just lost the southern tip and  
Boom we've gotta run to Harlem quick we can't afford another slip  
Guns and horses giddy up I decide to divvy up  
My forces they're skittish as the British cut the city up  
This close to giving up facing mad scrutiny  
I scream in the face of this mass mutiny  
Are these the men with which I am to defend America  
We ride at midnight Manhattan in the distance  
I cannot be everywhere at once people  
I'm in dire need of assistance  
Your excellency sir  
Who are you  
Aaron burr sir  
Permission to state my case  
As you were  
Sir I was a captain under general Montgomery  
Until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec and well in summary  
I think that I could be of some assistance  
I admire how you keep firing on the British from a distance  
Huh  
I have some questions a couple of suggestions  
On how to fight Instead of fleeing west  
Yes  
Well  
Your excellency you wanted to see me  
Hamilton come in have you met burr  
Yes sir  
We keep meeting  
As I was saying sir  
I look forward to seeing your strategy play out  
Burr  
Sir  
Close the door on your way out  
Have I done something wrong sir  
On the contrary  
I called you here because our odds are beyond scary  
Your reputation precedes you but I have to laugh  
Sir  
Hamilton how come no one can get you on their staff  
Sir  
Don't get me wrong you're a young man of great renown  
I know you stole British cannons when we were still downtown  
Nathanael Greene and Henry Knox wanted to hire you  
To be their secretary I don't think so  
Now why are you upset  
I'm not  
It's alright you want to fight you've got a hunger  
I was just like you when I was younger  
Head full of fantasies of dying like a martyr  
Yes  
Dying is easy young man living is harder  
Why are you telling me this  
I'm being honest  
I'm working with a third of what our congress has promised  
We are a powder keg about to explode  
I need someone like you to lighten the load  
So  
I am not throwing away my shot  
I am not throwing away my shot  
Hey yo I'm just like my country  
I'm young scrappy and hungry  
I am not throwing away my shot  
Son we are outgunned out manned  
You need all the help you can get I have some friends  
Lauren's mulligan marquis DE Lafayette okay what else  
Outnumbered out planned  
We'll need some spies on the inside  
Some king's men who might let some things slide  
Boom whoa whoa whoa  
I'll write to congress and tell them we need supplies  
You rally the guys master the element of surprise  
Chicka-boom whoa whoa whoa  
I'll rise above my station organize your information  
Til we rise to the occasion of our new nation sir  
Here comes the general  
Rise up what  
Here comes the general  
Rise up what  
Here comes the general  
Rise up what  
Here comes the general  
What  
And his right hand man  
Boom
