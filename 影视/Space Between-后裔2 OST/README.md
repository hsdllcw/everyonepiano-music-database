### Space Between歌词：

[Evie:] I didn't know what you were goin' through  
I thought that you were fine  
Why did you have to hide  
[Mal:] I didn't want to let you down  
But the truth is out  
It's tearin' me apart, not listenin' to my heart  
[Mal:] I really had to go  
[Evie:] And I would never stop you  
[Mal:] Even though we've changed  
[Evie:] Nothing has to change  
[Both:] And you can find me in the space between  
Where two worlds come to meet  
I'll never be out of reach  
'Cause you're a part of me  
So you can find me in the space between  
You'll never be alone  
No matter where you go  
We can meet in the space between  
[Mal:] Nothing can stay the same  
It's growing pains  
[Evie:] Be proud of all the scars  
They make you who you are  
[Evie:] I know you have to stay  
[Mal:] But I'll never really leave you  
[Evie:] Nothing has to change  
[Mal:] Even though we've changed  
[Both:] You can find me in the space between  
Where two worlds come to meet  
I'll never be out of reach  
'Cause you're a part of me  
So you can find me in the space between  
You'll never be alone  
No matter where you go  
We can meet in the space between  
[Mal:] There are no words left to say  
[Evie:] I know you gotta find your place  
[Mal:] But this is not the end  
[Evie:] No  
[Mal:] You're part of who I am  
[Both:] Even if we're worlds apart  
You're still in my heart  
It will always be you and me, yeah!  
[Evie:] You can find me in the space between  
[Both:] Where two worlds come to meet  
[Evie:] I'll never be out of reach  
[Mal:] I'll never be out of reach  
[Evie:] No  
[Both:] 'Cause you're a part of me  
So you can find me in the space between  
[Evie:] You'll never be alone  
[Mal:] No matter where you go  
[Both:] We can meet in the space between  
[Evie:] Yeah  
[Mal:] No matter where you go  
[Evie:] No matter where you go  
[Both:] We can meet in the space between
