### I Will Follow Him歌词：

I will follow him  
Follow him where ever he may go  
And near him I always will be  
For nothing can keep me away;  
He is my destiny  
I will follow him  
Ever since he touched my heart I knew  
There isn't an ocean too deep  
A mountain so high it can keep  
Keep me away  
Away from his love  
I love him  
I love him  
I love himAnd where he goes I'll follow  
I'll follow I'll follow  
I will follow him  
Follow him where ever he may go  
There isn't an ocean too deep  
A mountain so high it can keep  
Keep me away  
We will follow him  
Follow him where ever he may go  
There isn't an ocean too deep  
A mountain so high it can keep  
Keep us away  
Away from his love  
I love him oh yes I love him;  
I'll follow  
I'm gonna follow  
True love  
He'll always be my true love  
Forever from now until forever  
I love him I love him I love him  
And where he goes I'll follow  
I'll follow I'll follow  
I'll follow  
He'll always be my true love  
My true love  
My true love from now until forever  
Forever forever  
There isn't an ocean too deep  
A mountain so high it can keep  
Nothing can keep us away  
Away from his love
