_Jenny of Oldstones_
被视为可能是暗示后面剧情的歌曲，也成为了《冰与火之歌：权力游戏》最终季第二集的的片尾曲。片尾曲版本由英国独立乐团芙萝伦丝机进份子（Florence +
the Machine）的主唱芙萝伦丝威尔希（Florence Leontine Mary
Welch）演唱，在结束后MV立刻在社群网站洗版，被称赞是：最适合中古世纪的嗓音。

同时，网站还为大家提供了《[The Night King](Music-10415-The-Night-King-权力的游戏第八季OST.html "The

### Jenny of Oldstones歌词：

High in the halls of the kings who are gone  
Jenny would dance with her ghosts  
The ones she had lost and the ones she had found  
And the ones who had loved her the most  
The ones who'd been gone for so very long  
She couldn't remember their names  
They spun her around on the damp old stones  
Spun away all her sorrow and pain  
And she never wanted to leave never wanted to leave  
Never wanted to leave never wanted to leave  
They danced through the day  
And into the night through the snow that swept through the hall  
From winter to summer then winter again  
'Til the walls did crumble and fall  
And she never wanted to leave never wanted to leave  
Never wanted to leave never wanted to leave  
And she never wanted to leave never wanted to leave  
Never wanted to leave never wanted to leave  
High in the halls of the kings who are gone  
Jenny would dance with her ghosts  
The ones she had lost and the ones she had found  
And the ones  
Who had loved her the most
