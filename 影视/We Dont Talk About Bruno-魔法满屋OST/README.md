### We Don't Talk About Bruno歌词：

We don't talk about Bruno no no no  
We don't talk about Bruno but  
It was my wedding day  
It was our wedding day  
We were getting ready  
And there wasn't a cloud in the sky  
No clouds allowed in the sky  
Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin  
Thunder  
You telling this story or am I  
I'm sorry mi vida go on  
Bruno says &quot;It looks like rain&quot;  
Why did he tell us  
In doing so he floods my brain  
Abuela get the umbrellas  
Married in a hurricane  
What a joyous day but anyway  
We don't talk about Bruno no no no  
We don't talk about Bruno  
Hey grew to live in fear of Bruno stuttering or stumbling  
I can always hear him sort of muttering and mumbling  
I associate him with the sound of falling sand ch ch ch  
It's a heavy lift with a gift so humbling  
Always left Abuela and the family fumbling  
Grappling with prophecies they couldn't understand  
Do you understand  
A seven-foot frame rats along his back  
When he calls your name it all fades to black  
Yeah he sees your dreams and feasts on your screams  
Hey  
We don't talk about Bruno no no no  
We don't talk about Bruno  
He told me my fish would die the next day dead  
No no  
He told me I'd grow a gut and just like he said  
No no  
He said that all my hair would disappear now look at my head  
No no  
Your fate is sealed when your prophecy is read  
He told me that the life of my dreams  
Would be promised and someday be mine  
He told me that my power would grow  
Like the grapes that thrive on the vine  
Óye Mariano's on his way  
He told me that the man of my dreams  
Would be just out of reach  
Betrothed to another  
It's like I hear him now  
Hey sis I want not a sound out of you  
It's like I can hear him now I can hear him now  
Um Bruno  
Yeah about that Bruno  
I really need to know about Bruno  
Gimme the truth and the whole truth Bruno  
Isabela your boyfriend's here  
Time for dinner  
A seven-foot frame rats along his back  
It was my wedding day it was our wedding day  
When he calls your name it all fades to black  
We were getting ready and there wasn't a cloud in the sky  
Yeah he sees your dreams and feasts on your screams  
Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin  
You telling this story or am I  
Óye Mariano's on his way  
Bruno says &quot;It looks like rain&quot;  
He told me that the man of my dreams would be just out of reach  
In doing so he floods my brain  
Betrothed to another another  
Married in a hurricane  
And I'm fine and I'm fine and I'm fine I'm fine  
He's here  
Don't talk about Bruno no  
Why did I talk about Bruno  
Not a word about Bruno  
I never shoulda brought up Bruno
