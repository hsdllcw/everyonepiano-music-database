### All Eyes On Me歌词：

Get your f**kin' hands up  
Get on out of your seats  
All eyes on me all eyes on me  
Get your f**kin' hands up  
Get on out of your seats  
All eyes on me all eyes on me  
Are you feeling nervous  
Are you having fun  
It's almost over it's just begun  
Don't overthink this look in my eye  
Don't be scared don't be shy  
Come on in the water's fine  
We're goin' to go where everybody knows  
Everybody knows everybody oh  
We're goin' to go where everybody knows  
Everybody knows  
Get your f**kin' hands up  
Get on out of your seat  
All eyes on me all eyes on me  
Ayy come on get your f**kin' hands up  
Get on out of your seat  
All eyes on me all eyes on me yeah come on  
Heads down pray for me  
Heads down now pray for me  
Get your f**kin' hands up  
Get on out of your seat  
All eyes on me all eyes on me  
You wanna hear a funny story  
So uh five years ago I quit performing live comedy  
Because I was beginning to have uh severe panic attacks while on stage  
Which is not a great place to have them  
So I I quit and I didn't perform for five years  
And I spent that time trying to improve myself mentally  
And you know what  
I did I got better  
I got so much better in fact that in January of 2020  
I thought "You know what  
I should start performing again  
I've been hiding from the world and I need to re-enter"  
And then the funniest thing happened  
Are you feeling nervous  
Are you having fun  
It's almost over it's just begun  
Don't overthink this look in my eye  
Don't be scared don't be shy  
Come on in the water's fine  
You say the ocean's rising like I give a s**t  
You say the whole world's ending honey it already did  
You're not gonna slow it Heaven knows you tried  
Got it  
Good now get inside  
We're goin' to go where everybody knows  
Everybody knows everybody knows  
We're goin' to go where everybody knows  
Everybody knows  
Come on get your f**kin' hands up  
Get on out of your seat  
All eyes on me all eyes on me  
Hey come on get your f**kin' hands up  
Get on out of your seats  
All eyes on me all eyes on me yeah  
Heads down pray for me  
Heads down now pray for me  
I said get your f**kin' hands up  
Get up get up  
I'm talkin' to you get the f**k up  
Get your f**kin' hands up  
Get on out of your seat  
All eyes on me all eyes on me

Get on out of your seat  
All eyes on me all eyes on me yeah  
Come on heads down pray for me  
Heads down now pray for me  
I said get your f**kin' hands up  
Get on
