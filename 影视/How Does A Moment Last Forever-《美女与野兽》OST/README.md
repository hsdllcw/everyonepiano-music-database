### How Does A Moment Last Forever歌词：

How does a moment last forever  
How can a story never die  
It is love we must hold onto  
Never easy but we try  
Sometimes our happiness is captured  
Somehow our time and place stand still  
Love lives on inside our hearts and always will  
Minutes turn to hours days to years and gone  
But when all else has been forgotten  
Still our song lives on  
Maybe some moments weren't so perfect  
Maybe some memories not so sweet  
But we have to know some bad times  
Or our lives are incomplete  
Then when our shadows overtake us  
Just when we feel our hope is gone  
We'll hear our song and know once more  
Our love lives on  
How does a moment last forever  
How does our happiness endure  
Through the darkest of our troubles  
Love is beauty love is pure  
Love pays no mind to desolation  
It flows like a river through the soul  
Protects perceives and perseveres  
And makes us whole  
Minutes turn to hours days to years then gone  
But when all else has been forgotten  
Still our song lives on  
How does a moment last forever  
When our song lives on
