还记得Billie Eilish巡演时，引起全场粉丝尖叫的背景短片么？短片叫做 **Not My Responsibility** ，是Billie
Eilish对那些攻击她的人的正面回击。

Billie用MV来回击那些对她外貌，形体，着装，音乐风格等持有偏见的人群。并表示自己的价值不在于他人的看法，他人对自己的一系列看法没有必要负责！其中一段讲到：「如果我穿的舒适，我就不是女人；如果我脱掉衣服，我就是
slut. 尽管你从未看过我的身体，却仍旧评判。」不愧是酷盖女孩，爱了爱了！

### Not My Responsibility歌词：

Do you know me?  
Really know me?  
You have opinions  
About my opinions  
About my music  
About my clothes  
About my body  
Some people hate what I wear  
Some people praise it  
Some people use it to shame others  
Some people use it to shame me  
But I feel you watching  
Always  
And nothing I do goes unseen  
So while I feel your stares  
Your disapproval  
Or your sigh of relief  
If I lived by them  
I'd never be able to move  
Would you like me to be smaller?  
Weaker?  
Softer?  
Taller?  
Would you like me to be quiet?  
Do my shoulders provoke you?  
Does my chest?  
Am I my stomach?  
My hips?  
The body I was born with  
Is it not what you wanted?  
If I wear what is comfortable  
I am not a woman  
If I shed the layers  
I'm a slut  
Though you've never seen my body  
You still judge it  
And judge me for it  
Why?  
We make assumptions about people  
Based on their size  
We decide who they are  
We decide what they're worth  
If I wear more  
If I wear less  
Who will decide what that makes me?  
What that means?  
Is my value based only on your perception?  
Or is your opinion of me?  
Not my responsibility
