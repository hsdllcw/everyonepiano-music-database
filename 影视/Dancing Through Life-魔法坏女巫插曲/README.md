_Dancing Through Life_ 是薇尼•霍兹曼创作的音乐剧《魔法坏女巫》的插曲。《魔法坏女巫》（Wicked）
自2003年在百老汇首演以来已经吸引了世界范围内超过5000万观众，获得了超过100个奖项，风靡百老汇与西区十余年。其中所获奖项包括1座格莱美、2座奥利弗奖和3座托尼奖。《魔法坏女巫》是有史以来世界上最受瞩目、最壮观也是最成功的剧作之一，至今已经在14个国家上演，有6种语言版本。

《泰晤士报》称其为“《歌剧魅影》后最宏大的作品”。《魔法坏女巫》是对家喻户晓的《绿野仙踪》故事创造性的解构与重述。通体翠绿、遭人排挤的艾芙芭Elphaba，和娇俏讨喜、志存高远的格琳达Glinda，在经历了一系列理想与幻灭，背叛与宽恕之后，结下了深厚而难言的友谊，并收获了各自的历练与成长，其中体现的女性自我意识觉醒以及有关话语权的思考，在当今时代的语境下愈久弥新。宏大而极富想象力的布景舞美亦是一大看点。从天而降的泡泡船，悬于穹顶的神秘地图，浮华艳丽的奥兹人服装，不失为现今百老汇舞台上数一数二的视听盛宴。

### Dancing Through Life歌词：

The trouble with schools is  
They always try to teach the wrong lessons  
Believe me I've been kicked out  
Of enough of them to know  
They want you to become less callow  
Less shallow  
But I say why invite stress in  
Stop studying strife  
And learn to live the unexamined life  
Dancing through life  
Skimming the surface  
Gliding where turf is smooth  
Life's more painless  
For the brainless  
Why think too hard  
When it's so soothing  
Dancing through life  
No need to tough it  
When you can slough it off as I do  
Nothing matters  
But knowing nothing matters  
It's just life  
So keep dancing through  
Dancing through life  
Swaying and sweeping  
And always keeping cool  
Life is fraught-less  
When you're thoughtless  
Those who don't try  
Never look foolish  
Dancing through life  
Mindless and careless  
Make sure you're where less trouble is rife  
Woes are fleeting  
Blows are glancing  
When you're dancing  
Through life  
So  
What's the most swankified place in town  
That would be the Ozdust Ballroom  
Sounds perfect  
Let's go down to the Ozdust Ballroom  
We'll meet there later tonight  
We can dance till it's light  
Find the prettiest girl  
Give 'er a whirl  
Right on down to the Ozdust Ballroom  
Come on  
Follow me  
You'll be happy to be there  
Dancing through life  
Down at the Ozdust  
If only because dust  
Is what we come to  
Nothing matters  
But knowing nothing matters  
It's just life  
So keep dancing through  
M-Miss Galinda  
I I hope you'll save at least one dance for me  
I'll be right there waiting all night  
Oh that's so kind  
But you know what would be even kinder  
See that tragically beautiful girl  
The one in the chair  
It seems so unfair  
We should go on a spree  
And not she  
Gee  
I know someone would be my hero  
If that someone were to go invite her  
Well maybe I could invite her  
Oh Biq really  
You would do that for me  
I would do anything for you Miss Galinda  
So  
So I'll be picking you up around eight  
After all  
Now that we've met one another  
It's clear we deserve each other  
You're perfect  
You're perfect  
So we're perfect together  
Born to be forever  
Dancing through life  
Oh Elphaba isn't it wonderful  
Finally for this one night  
I'm about to have a fun night  
With this Munchkin boy Galinda found for me  
And I only wish there were  
Something I could do for her to repay her  
Elphaba see  
We deserve each other  
And Galinda helped it come true  
We deserve each other  
Me and Boq  
Please Elphaba try to understand  
I do  
Listen Galinda  
Nessa and I were talking about you just now  
And I was just talking about you  
I thought you might want to wear this hat to the party tonight  
It's really uh sharp don't you think  
You know black is this year's pink  
You deserve each other  
This hat and you  
You're both so smart  
You deserve each other  
So here out of the goodness of my heart  
Listen Nessa  
Yes  
Uh Nessa  
I've got something to confess a  
Reason why well  
Why I asked you here tonight  
Now I know it isn't fair  
Oh Boq I know why  
You do  
It's because I'm in this chair  
And you felt sorry for me  
Well isn't that right  
No  
No it's because uh because  
Because you are so beautiful  
Oh Boq I think you're wonderful  
And we deserve each other  
Don't you see this is our chance  
We deserve each other  
Don't we Boq  
You know what  
Let's dance  
What  
Let's dance  
Dancing through life  
Down at the Ozdust  
If only because dust  
Is what we come to  
And the strange thing  
Your life could end up changing  
While you're dancing  
Through
