### On Me歌词：

You could call you could call on me  
You could fall you could fall on me  
And if you want to tell me what you gon' do  
You could put it all put it all on me  
Speedin' 90 in a 65  
Grabbed the keys and didn't tell 'em why  
Just hit the road  
When you need me relaxin' gettin' in my way  
I'm flyin' down the interstate  
Just know just know  
When you can't pull through when life's hard on you  
Know it ain't no thing know it ain't no thing  
You know what to do  
You could call you can call on me On me  
You could fall you can fall on me On me  
And if you want to tell me what you're gon' do  
You could put it all put it all on me  
You can count on me one two three  
Make it easy for you A B C  
And if you want to tell me what you're gon' do  
You could put it all put it all on me  
I walk in Yeah you did  
Help you get up off that floor Come on  
You ain't gotta be alone no more No more  
Just know just know  
When you can't pull through when life's hard on you So hard  
Know it ain't no thing know it ain't no thing  
You know what to do  
You could call you could call on me On me  
You could fall you could fall on me On me  
And if you want to tell me what you're gon' do
