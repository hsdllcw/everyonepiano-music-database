很多人看《权力的游戏》会有种心酸的感觉，特别是当听到《The Rains of
Castamere》（卡斯特梅的雨季）的时候尤其强烈，在全剧中，每次这歌曲一出现，必有人将要悲剧。

实际上是因为你习惯性的代入了自己，而代入对象正好就是看起来似乎是主角的狼家史塔克。第一季，爹死了。第二季，家破人亡。血色婚礼中更加的惨，可谓是灭顶之灾。

实际上，这首曲子是描写泰温•兰尼斯特的超神战歌，《The Rains of
Castamere》是一首描写泰温清理对家族不敬的封臣，让雷耶斯家族和塔贝克家族彻底被消灭，满门抄斩，整个城成为一片废墟的歌曲。

### The Rains of Castamere歌词：

And who are you the proud Lord said  
That I must bow so low  
Only a cat of a different coat  
That's all the truth I know  
In a coat of gold or a coat of red  
A lion still has claws  
And mine are long and sharp my lord  
As long and sharp as yours  
And so he spoke and so he spoke  
That Lord of Castamere  
But now the rains weep over his hall  
And not a soul to hear  
And who are you the proud Lord said  
That I must bow so low  
Only a cat of a different coat  
That's all the truth I know  
And so he spoke and so he spoke  
That Lord of Castamere  
But now the rains weep over his hall  
And not a soul to hear  
And so he spoke and so he spoke  
That Lord of Castamere  
But now the rains weep over his hall  
And not a soul to hear  
And so he spoke and so he spoke  
That Lord of Castamere  
But now the rains weep over his hall  
And not a soul to hear  
And not a soul to hear
