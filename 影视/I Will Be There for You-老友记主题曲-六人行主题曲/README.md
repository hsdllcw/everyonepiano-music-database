### I'll Be There for You歌词：

So no one told you life was gonna be this way  
Your job's a joke' you're broke' your love life's D O A  
It's like you're always stuck in second gear  
When it hasn't been your day' your week' your month' or even your year  
But I'll be there for you  
(When the rain starts to pour)  
I'll be there for you  
(Like I've been there before)  
I'll be there for you  
('Cause you're there for me too)  
You're still in bed at ten and work began at eight  
You've burned your breakfast; so far' things are going great  
Your mother warned you there'd be days like these  
But she didn't tell when the world has brought you down to your knees  
But I'll be there for you  
(When the rain starts to pour)  
I'll be there for you  
(Like I've been there before)  
I'll be there for you  
('Cause you're there for me too)  
No one could ever know me' no one could ever see me  
Seems you're the only one who knows what it's like to be me  
Someone to face the day with' make it through all the rest with  
Someone I will always laugh with  
Even at my worst' I'm best with you  
Yeah  
It's like you're always stuck in second gear  
When it hasn't been your day' your week' your month' or even your year  
I'll be there for you  
(When the rain starts to pour)  
I'll be there for you  
(Like I've been there before)  
I'll be there for you  
('Cause you're there for me too)  
I'll be there for you  
I'll be there for you  
I'll be there for you  
Cause you're there for me too
