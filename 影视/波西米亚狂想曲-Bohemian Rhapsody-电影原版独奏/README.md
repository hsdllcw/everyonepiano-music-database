《 **波西米亚狂想曲** 》（英语：Bohemian
Rhapsody）是皇后乐队（Queen）的歌曲。也是音乐传记电影《波西米亚狂想曲》的骨干歌曲，为电影开启及总结佛莱迪·摩克瑞璀璨的一生。

该歌曲结构极为特殊，副歌部分并没有重复，而是由几个风格差异甚大的部分构成，包括乡谣、吉他独奏、歌剧、硬摇滚等，并且充满着猛烈的意识流与噩梦色彩。该歌曲是一首精心设计的复杂作品，亦是皇后乐队的标志性作品，作为一支全篇没有重复段落的华丽摇滚艺术作品，该歌曲从开篇开始突然进入歌剧部分，然后又忽然转入摇滚，最后又归于抒情。

### 波西米亚狂想曲-Bohemian Rhapsody歌词：

Is this the real life  
Is this just fantasy  
Caught in a landslide no escape from reality  
Open your eyes look up to the skies and see  
I'm just a poor boy I need no sympathy  
Because I'm easy come easy go little high little low  
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me to me  
Mama just killed a man  
Put a gun against his head  
Pulled my trigger now he's dead  
Mama life had just begun  
But now I've gone and thrown it all away  
Mama ooh didn't mean to make you cry  
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow  
Carry on carry on as if nothing really matters  
Too late my time has come  
Sends shivers down my spine  
My body's aching all the time  
Goodbye everybody I've got to go  
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth  
Mama ooh  
Any way the wind blows  
I don't wanna die  
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all  
I see a little silhouetto of a man  
Scaramouche Scaramouche will you do the Fandango  
Thunderbolt and lightning very very fright'ning me  
Galileo  
Galileo Galileo  
Galileo Galileo Figaro magnifico  
I'm just a poor boy nobody loves me  
He's just a poor boy from a poor family  
Spare him his life from this monstrosity  
Easy come easy go will you let me go  
Bismillah  
No we will not let you go  
Let him go  
Bismillah  
We will not let you go  
Let him go  
Bismillah  
We will not let you go  
Let me go  
Will not let you go  
Let me go  
Will not let you go  
Let me go  
Ah  
No no no no no no no  
Oh mamma mia mamma mia  
Mamma mia let me go  
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me for me for me  
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye  
So you think you can love me and leave me to die  
Oh baby can't do this to me baby  
Just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here  
Nothing really matters anyone can see  
Nothing really matters  
Nothing really matters to me
