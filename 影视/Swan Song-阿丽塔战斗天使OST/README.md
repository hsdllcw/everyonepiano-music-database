### Swan Song歌词：

I I can't lie  
I'm scared to open my eyes  
'Cause what if I find nothing at all  
Nothing at all  
What is the point of my lips  
If they don't make noise ah  
What is the point of doing nothing at all  
Watching it fall  
The flicker burning  
You know the time's running running out  
Only I see all the diamonds diamonds  
Breaking down  
I won't stay quiet I won't stay quiet  
Cause staying silent's the same as dying  
I won't stay quiet the flicker's burning low  
This is not a this is not a  
Swan swan song  
This is not a this is not a  
Swan swan song  
We just gotta we just gotta hold on tonight  
This is not a this is not a  
Swan song swan song  
Swan dive yeah  
It's a new life  
Real fantasy  
Wishing it was make believe  
What is the reason of doing nothing at all  
Watching it fall  
The flicker burning  
You know the time's running running out  
Only I see all the diamonds diamonds  
Breaking down  
I won't stay quiet I won't stay quiet  
Cause staying silent's the same as dying  
I won't stay quiet the flicker's burning low  
This is not a this is not a  
Swan swan song  
This is not a this is not a  
Swan swan song  
We just gotta we just gotta hold on tonight  
This is not a this is not a  
Swan song swan song  
Swan dive yeah  
It's a new life  
Tread heavily around me  
Tread heavily around me  
Tread heavily  
Tread heavily around me  
Tread heavily tread  
This is not a this is not a  
Swan  
Tread heavily  
Swan song  
Tread  
This is not a this is not a  
Swan  
Tread heavily  
Swan song  
Tread  
We just gotta we just gotta hold on tonight  
This is not a this is not a  
Swan song swan song  
Swan dive yeah  
Yeah it's a new life  
It's a new life
