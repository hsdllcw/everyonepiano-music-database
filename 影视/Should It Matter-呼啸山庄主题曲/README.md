《 **Should It Matter** 》由挪威女歌手Sissel演唱，同时也是《呼啸山庄》的主题曲。

歌词描写的是一个女生在情感失意时的追悔和感伤。宛如天籁的女声，像不食人间烟火的北欧女神，她的嗓子完美得像通透无暇的水晶，令人目眩心动，不能自己；尤其高音部分，能高耸入云，永无止境。

### Should It Matter歌词：

I look at you  
Please don't walk away  
I see you're about to  
There is just something I'd really like to say  
So please don't walk away  
I know that you're there  
Still you pretend you're not  
Yes I know it hurts  
I have also felt the pain  
So should it matter  
What I do or what I've done  
As long as in my heart  
You're still the only one  
I hear you say it  
But I don't think you understand  
I can be trusted now' I swear to you I can  
It's been a year  
A memory from my past  
I know what I did wrong  
I wish to change  
Just to make it last  
But I guess it's been too long  
Easy to move on  
To forget to about it all  
Is that what you do' hoping I will be gone  
So should it matter  
What I do or what I've done  
As long as in my heart  
You're still the only one  
I hear you say it  
But I don't think you understand  
I can be trusted now' I swear to you I can  
If you got to know me again  
Maybe then maybe then  
We could see what what we should do  
But that's all up to you  
I'll be waiting for you  
So should it matter  
What I do or what I've done  
As long as in my heart  
You're still the only one  
I hear you say it  
But I don't think you understand  
I can be trusted now' I swear to you I can  
I hear you say it  
But I don't think you understand  
I can be trusted now' I swear to you I can
