### Cold歌词：

Love's getting cold  
My heart is cold  
Time's getting slow  
We gotta go  
I'm standing here  
I'm waiting still  
I can't tolerate though  
When you promise you'll be there  
Always be you sweared  
But now it is buried  
No one I can share  
Driving my heart away  
Losing my breath  
A million words left to say  
It's too late that I'm speechless  
My days are blue  
I wonder you  
There's nothing new  
I wonder you  
Life's standing here  
And waiting still  
But memories still kill  
When you promise you'll be there  
Always be you sweared  
But now it is buried  
No one I can share  
Driving my heart away  
Losing my breath  
A million words left to say  
It's too late that I'm speechless  
I'm just cold so cold  
How I'm missing you  
Talking to myself  
I hate that I still care  
Ah  
When you promise you'll be there  
Always be you sweared  
But now it is buried  
No one could save it  
Driving my heart away  
Losing my base  
How can I keep on and stay  
That's too late now we're speechless
