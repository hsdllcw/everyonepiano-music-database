### Is That Alright歌词：

Life is so simple  
A little boy a little girl  
Laughing and loving  
Trying to figure out the world  
It felt like summer  
When I kissed you in the rain  
And I know your story  
But tell me again  
Nothing you say wouldn't interest me  
All of your words are like poems to me  
I would be honored if you would take me as I am  
I want you to look right in my eyes  
To tell me you love me to be by my side  
I want you at the end of my life  
I wanna see your face when I fall with grace  
At the moment I die  
Is that alright  
Is that alright  
I hope you're still with me when I'm not quite myself  
And I pray that you'll lift me when you know I need help  
It's a warm celebration of all of our years  
I dream of our story of our fairy tale  
Family dinners and family trees  
Teaching the kids to say thank you and please  
Knowing if we stay together that things will be right  
I want you to look right in my eyes  
To tell me you love me to be by my side  
I want you at the end of my life  
I wanna see your face when I fall with grace  
At the moment I die  
Is that alright  
Is that alright  
Is that alright
