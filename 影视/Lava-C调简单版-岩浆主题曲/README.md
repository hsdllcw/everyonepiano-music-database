### Lava歌词：

A long long time ago  
There was a volcano  
Living all alone in the middle of the sea  
He sat high above his bay  
Watching all the couples play  
And wishing that he had someone too  
And from his lava came this song of hope  
That he sang out loud  
Everyday for years and years  
I have a dream I hope will come true  
You're here with me and I'm here with you  
I wish that the earth sea the sky up above  
Will send me someone to lava  
Years of singing all alone turned his lava into stone  
Until he was on the brink of extinction  
But little did he know that living in the sea below  
Another volcano was listening to his song  
Everyday she heard his tune her lava grew and grew  
Because she believed his song was meant for her  
Now she was so ready to meet him above the sea  
As he sang his song of hope for the last time  
I have a dream I hope will come true  
That you're here with me and I'm here with you  
I wish that the earth sea the sky up above  
Will send me someone to lava  
Rising from the sea below stood a lovely volcano  
Looking all around but she could not see him  
He tried to sing to let her know  
That she was not there alone  
But with no lava his song was so gone  
He filled the sea with his tears  
And watched his dreams disappear  
As she remembered what his song meant to her  
I have a dream I hope will come true  
That you're here with me and I'm here with you  
I wish that the earth sea the sky up above  
Will send me someone to lava  
Oh they were so happy  
To finally meet above the sea  
All together now their lava grew and grew  
The longer are they all alone with aloha as their new home  
And when you visit them this is what they sing  
I have a dream I hope will come true  
That you'll grow old with me and I'll grow old with you  
We thank the earth sea the sky we've been to  
I lava you  
I lava you  
I lava you
