《 **Hold My Hand** 》是电影《壮志凌云2：独行侠》的主题曲，由Lady Gaga演唱，词曲由Lady
Gaga和BloodPop创作，作为单曲于2022年5月3日发行。

此曲充满正能量，Lady Gaga的歌声带有浓烈的混响效果，而轰鸣的鼓声和电吉他独奏使得该曲带有中音民谣的风格。

在MV中，出现了影片的许多镜头。可以看出，由汤姆•克鲁斯所扮演的飞行员，并未从过去的失意中走出。过去的种种，总会如影随形地在他身边出现。整支主题曲显得非常大气与高亢。

### Hold My Hand歌词：

To tell me you need me  
Hold my hand everything will be okay  
I heard from the heavens that clouds have been grey  
Pull me close wrap me in your aching arms  
I see that you're hurtin' why'd you take so long  
To tell me you need me  
I see that you're bleedin'  
You don't need to show me again  
But if you decide to I'll ride in this life with you  
I won't let go 'til the end  
So cry tonight  
But don't you let go of my hand  
You can cry every last tear  
I won't leave 'til I understand  
Promise me just hold my hand  
Raise your head look into my wishful eyes  
That fear that's inside you will lift give it time  
I can see everything you're blind to now  
Your prayers will be answered let God whisper how  
To tell me you need me  
I see that you're bleedin'  
You don't need to show me again  
But if you decide to I'll ride in this life with you  
I won't let go 'til the end  
So cry tonight  
But don't you let go of my hand  
You can cry every last tear  
I won't leave 'til I understand  
Promise you'll just hold my hand  
Hold my hand hold my  
Hold my hand my hand  
I'll be right here hold my hand  
Hold my hand hold my  
Hold my hand my hand  
I'll be right here hold my hand  
I know you're scared and your pain is imperfect  
But don't you give up on yourself  
I've heard a story a girl she once told me  
That I would be happy again  
Hold my hand  
Hold my hand  
Hold my hand hold my hand  
Hold my hand hold my hand  
Hold my hand  
I heard from the heavens
