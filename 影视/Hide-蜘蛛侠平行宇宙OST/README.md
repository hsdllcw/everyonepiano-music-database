### Hide歌词：

Need a drink  
Hoo ayy ayy  
Found my home  
Hoo ooh hoo oh  
She make me leave the thrills at home and I'm fine  
Really think I found my home shorty made me feel at home  
She made me leave the thrills at home  
And I'm fine with it  
She really made me lose control  
I'ma let my love unfold  
We're just two lost souls but we're fine with it  
Fine with it  
There's love at my front door short notice  
She not like the sane girls I noticed  
Think I met my soulmate yeah I know it  
When it gets dark outside in you I confide  
You help me face my demons I won't hide hide  
Girls like you are hard to find  
I hope you don't mind  
If I give you the time of your life life life  
Really think I found my home  
Shorty made me feel at home  
She made me leave the thrills at home  
And I'm fine with it  
She really made me lose control  
I'ma let my love unfold  
We're just two lost souls  
But we're fine with it  
Life is not the same with your pictures in my frame  
Now that you're here  
I want nothing to change  
You pick me up when I'm down I need you around  
You seen me through my darkest times  
Girl is there something that you try to find  
You brought meaning to my life  
All because of you I do right  
Because of you I have a purpose  
Fight for the world because you're worth it  
Really think I found my home shorty made me feel at home  
She made me leave the thrills at home  
And I'm fine with it  
She really made me lose control  
I'ma let my love unfold  
We're just two lost souls but we're fine with it
