### I'll Never Love Again歌词：

[Lady Gaga:]  
Wish I could  
I could have said goodbye  
I would have said what I wanted to  
Maybe even cried for you  
If I knew it would be the last time  
I would have broke my heart in two  
Tryna to save a part of you  
Don't wanna feel another touch  
Don't wanna start another fire  
Don't wanna know another kiss  
No other name falling off my lips  
Don't wanna give my heart away  
To another stranger  
Or let another day begin  
Won't even let the sunlight in  
No I'll never love again  
I'll never love again  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
When we first met  
I never thought that I would fall  
I never thought that I'd find myself lyin' in your arms  
Mmmm mmmm  
And I wanna pretend that it's not true oh baby that you're gone  
'Cause my world keeps turnin' and turnin' and turnin' and I'm not movin' on  
Don't wanna feel another touch  
Don't wanna start another fire  
Don't wanna know another kiss  
No other name falling off my lips  
Don't wanna give my heart away  
To another stranger  
Or let another day begin  
Won't even let the sunlight in  
No I'll never love  
I don't wanna know this feeling unless it's you and me  
I don't wanna waste a moment, ooh  
And I don't wanna give somebody else the better part of me  
I would rather wait for you, ooh  
Don't wanna feel another touch  
Don't wanna start another fire  
Don't wanna know another kiss  
Baby unless they are your lips  
[Bradley Cooper:]  
Don't wanna give my heart away  
To another stranger  
Don't let another day begin  
Won't let the sunlight in  
Oh I'll never love again  
Never love again  
Never love again  
Oh I'll never love again
