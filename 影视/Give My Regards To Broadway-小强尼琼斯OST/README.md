### Give My Regards To Broadway歌词：

Verse 1  
Did you ever see two Yankees part upon a foreign shore  
When the good ship's just about to start for Old New York once more?  
With a tear-dimmed eye they say goodbye, they're friends without a doubt;  
When the man on the pier shouts loud and clear, as the ship strikes out...  
Verse 2  
Say hello to dear old Coney Isle, if there you chance to be,  
When you're at the Waldorf have a "smile" and charge it up to me;  
Mention my name ev'ry place you go, as 'round the town you roam;  
Wish you'd call on my gal, now remember, old pal, when you get back home...  
Chorus  
Give my regards to Broadway, remember me to Herald Square,  
Tell all the gang at Forty-Second Street, that I will soon be there;  
Whisper of how I'm yearning to mingle with the old time throng;  
Give my regards to old Broadway and say that I'll be there ere long.
