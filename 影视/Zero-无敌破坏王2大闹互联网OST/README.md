### Zero歌词：

I find it hard to say the things I want to say the most  
Find a little bit of steady as I get close  
Find a balance in the middle of the chaos  
Send me low send me high send me never demigod  
I remember walking in the cold of November  
Hoping that I make it to the end of December  
27 years and the end of my mind  
But holding to the thought of another time  
But looking to the ways at the ones before me  
Looking for the path of the young and lonely  
I don't want to hear about what to do  
I don't want to do it just to do it for you  
Hello hello  
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero zero  
Let me show you what it's like to always feel feel  
Like I'm empty and there's nothing really real real  
I'm looking for a way out  
Hello hello  
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero zero  
Let me show you what it's like to never feel feel  
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real real  
I'm looking for a way out  
I find it hard to tell you how I want to run away  
I understand it always makes you feel a certain way  
I find a balance in the middle of the chaos  
Send me up send me down send me never demigod  
I remember walkin' in the heat of the summer  
Wide-eyed one with a mind full of wonder  
27 years and I've nothing to show  
Falling from the doves to the dark of the crow  
Looking to the ways of the ones before me  
Looking for the path of the young and lonely  
I don't want to hear about what to do no  
I don't want to do it just to do it for you  
Hello hello  
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero zero  
Let me show you what it's like to always feel feel  
Like I'm empty and there's nothing really real real  
I'm looking for a way out  
Hello hello  
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero zero  
Let me show you what it's like to never feel feel  
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real real  
I'm looking for a way out  
Let me tell you 'bout it well let me tell you 'bout it  
Maybe you're the same as me  
Let me tell you 'bout it well let me tell you 'bout it  
They say the truth will set you free  
Hello hello  
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero zero  
Let me show you what it's like to always feel feel  
Like I'm empty and there's nothing really real real  
I'm looking for a way out  
Hello hello  
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero zero  
Let me show you what it's like to never feel feel  
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real real  
I'm looking for a way out
