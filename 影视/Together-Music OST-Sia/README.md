### Together歌词：

Ooh together we can take it higher  
I can hear the thunder  
Coming from your mouth  
And I know my number's up  
Give me some Stevie Wonder  
Quick put it on  
Before we go under  
I can see the lightning  
Coming from your ears  
Yeah I see you're frightened  
I can see the lion  
Sleeps tonight in the tears you're crying  
Oh you can't love me unless you love you too  
Treat yourself like nothing but a fool  
Can't love me unless you love you too  
Love you too  
Come now set the past on fire  
Stand up raise your face to the sky my love  
Together we can take it higher  
Oh together we can take it higher  
Come now set the past on fire  
Stand up raise your face to the sky my love  
Together we can take it higher  
Oh together we can take it higher  
I can see the rainbow  
Coming from your heart and it's all ok so  
Come now see you're my angel  
So say "Bye" to the past "Hello" to tomorrow  
Oh you can't love me unless you love you too  
Treat yourself like nothing but a fool  
Can't love me unless you love you too  
Love you too  
Come now set the past on fire  
Stand up raise your face to the sky my love  
Together we can take it higher  
Oh together we can take it higher  
Come now set the past on fire  
Stand up raise your face to the sky my love  
Together we can take it higher  
Oh together we can take it higher  
I want love I want to give it  
I want love please deliver it  
I want love I want to give it  
I want love please deliver it  
I want love I want to give it  
I want love please deliver it  
I want love I want to give it  
I want love please deliver it  
Come now set the past on fire  
Stand up raise your face to the sky my love  
Together we can take it higher  
Oh together we can take it higher  
Come now set the past on fire  
Stand up raise your face to the sky my love  
Together we can take it higher  
Oh together we can take it higher  
Oh together we can take it higher  
Oh together we can take it higher  
Oh together we can take it higher  
Oh together we can take it higher
