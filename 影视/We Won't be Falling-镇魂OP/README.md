### We Won't be Falling歌词：

We are the one  
We won't be falling down  
As the sun will keep on shining  
The story will keep on going  
We are the one  
We will be holding on  
For the promise we held for life  
For the people we love are leaving  
Please tell my friends  
We won't be falling down  
As the sun will keep on shining  
And the story will keep on going  
Ah  
We won't be falling down  
As the sun will keep on shining  
And the story will keep on going  
Ah  
We will be holding on  
As the sea will rise upon  
And the story will keep on going  
Ah  
We won't be falling down  
As the sun will keep on shining  
And the story will keep on going  
Ah  
We will be holding on  
As the sea will rise upon  
And the story will keep on going
