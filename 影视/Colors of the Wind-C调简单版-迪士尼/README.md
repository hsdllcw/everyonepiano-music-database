### Colors of the Wind歌词：

You think you own whatever land you land on  
The earth is just a dead thing you can claim  
But I know ev'ry rock and tree and creature  
Has a life has a spirit has a name  
You think the only people who are people  
Are the people who look and think like you  
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger  
You'll learn things you never knew you never knew  
Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon  
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned  
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain  
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind  
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind  
Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest  
Come taste the sun-sweet berries of the earth  
Come roll in all the riches all around you  
And for once never wonder what they're worth  
The rainstorm and the river are my brothers  
The heron and the otter are my friends  
And we're all connected to each other  
In a circle in a hoop that never ends  
Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon  
Or let the eagle tell you there he's been  
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain  
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind  
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind  
How high does the sycamore grow  
If you cut it down  
Then you'll never know  
And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon  
For whether we are white or copper-skinned  
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain  
Need to paint with all the colors of the wind  
You can own the earth and still  
All you'll own is earth until  
You can paint with all the colors of the wind
