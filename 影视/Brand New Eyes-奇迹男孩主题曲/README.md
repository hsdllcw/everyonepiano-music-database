### Brand New Eyes歌词：

When I'm looking at myself  
I see a thousand perspectives of me  
Everyone is letting me show  
A side of myself I can't see  
I'm wide awake now I'm free of the dawn  
Don't wanna look down  
And if I fall out I lay on the ground  
And look to the clouds  
It's like I got brand new eyes  
And I can finally see  
What has always been  
Right there in front of me  
And with these brand new eyes  
I'll take in everything  
And I will finally see me  
I can finally see  
I can finally see  
I can finally see  
I can finally see  
Couldn't let the world decide  
All of the things that I can or can't do  
What if I had taken all the things  
That broke me and made them my truth  
I'm wide awake now I'm free of the dawn  
Don't wanna look down  
And if I fall out I lay on the ground  
And look to the clouds  
It's like I got brand new eyes  
And I can finally see  
What has always been  
Right there in front of me  
And with these brand new eyes  
I'll take in everything  
And I will finally see me  
I can finally see  
I can finally see  
I can finally see  
I can finally see  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh
