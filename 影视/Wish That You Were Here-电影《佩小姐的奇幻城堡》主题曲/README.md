### Wish That You Were Here歌词：

[Verse 1]  
I've tried to leave it all behind me  
我已尝试过千百次 摆脱这无尽的阴云  
But I woke up and there they were beside me  
惊醒于美梦之间 它们却依旧如影随形  
And I don't believe it but I guess it's true  
纵是我笃定了它们的虚假 伤痛依旧真实不可动摇  
Some feelings, they can travel too  
只身遣心  
Oh there it is again, sitting on my chest  
孤独又上心头  
Makes it hard to catch my breath  
渐渐窒息  
I scramble for the light of change  
勉强拼凑希望  
[Pre-Chorus]  
You're always on my mind  
而你始终挥之不去  
You're always on my mind  
始终在我心间萦绕  
[Chorus]  
And I never minded being on my own  
我不在意孤独无声的降临  
Then something broke in me and I wanted to go home  
唯有在我心碎之时 只愿有一个港湾依靠  
To be where you are  
唯愿有你依靠  
But even closer to you, you seem so very far  
即使近在咫尺 我们的心却离得这么遥远  
And now I'm reaching out with every note I sing  
我唱出的每一个音符都纷飞着  
And I hope it gets to you on some pacific wind  
愿他们能够乘着太平洋的风向你送达我的消息  
Wraps itself around you and whispers in your ear  
温柔地包裹着你 在你耳畔呢喃  
Tells you that I miss you and I wish that you were here  
告诉你我是如此思念着你 希望你在我的身边  
[Verse 2]  
And if I stay home, I don't know  
留在孤单的家 我该何以为继  
There'll be so much that I'll have to let go  
有太多悲伤的回忆要我抛下  
You're disappearing all the time  
你永远不可捉摸  
But I still see you in the light  
但在光亮间 我依稀瞥见你的踪影  
For you, the shadows fight  
你让乌云密布散去 烟消云归  
And it's beautiful but there's that tug in the sight  
如此的美丽却难以欣赏 眼下的苦难还有太多  
I must stop time traveling, you're always on my mind  
停下这漫无止际的时空流转归于瞬息 你依旧教我挂念  
[Pre-Chorus]  
You're always on my mind  
始终挥之不去  
You're always on my mind  
在我心间萦绕  
[Chorus]  
And I never minded being on my own  
我不在意孤独无声的降临  
Then something broke in me and I wanted to go home  
唯有在我心碎之时 只愿有一个港湾依靠  
To be where you are  
唯愿有你依靠  
But even closer to you, you seem so very far  
即使近在咫尺 我们的心却离得这么遥远  
And now I'm reaching out with every note I sing  
我唱出的每一个音符都纷飞着  
And I hope it gets to you on some pacific wind  
愿他们能够乘着太平洋的风向你送达我的消息  
Wraps itself around you and whispers in your ear  
温柔地包裹住你 在你耳畔呢喃  
Tells you that I miss you and I wish that you were here  
告诉你我是如此思念着你 希望你在我的身边  
[Bridge]  
We all need something watching over us  
我们都需要彼此的观望  
Be it the falcons, the clouds or the crows  
化作鹰眼凛冽 浮云流转或鸦鸣入耳  
And then the sea swept in and left us all speechless  
海浪翻转 我们彼此无言  
Speechless  
彼此无言  
[Chorus]  
And I never minded being on my own  
我不在意孤独无声的降临  
Then something broke in me and I wanted to go home  
唯有在我心碎之时 只愿有一个港湾依靠  
To be where you are  
唯愿有你依靠  
But even closer to you, you seem so very far  
即使近在咫尺 心却靠得如此遥远  
And now I'm reaching out with every note I sing  
我唱出的每一个音符都纷飞着  
And I hope it gets to you on some pacific wind  
愿他们能够乘着太平洋的风向你送达我的消息  
Wraps itself around you and whispers in your ear  
温柔地包裹住你 在你耳畔呢喃  
Tells you that I miss you and I wish that you were here  
告诉你我是如此思念着你 希望你在我的身边  
[Post-Chorus]  
Wish that you were here  
希望有你在我身边  
Wish that you were here  
唯愿在此有你陪伴  
Wish that you were here  
希望有你在我身边  
I wish that you...  
唯愿在此有你陪伴
