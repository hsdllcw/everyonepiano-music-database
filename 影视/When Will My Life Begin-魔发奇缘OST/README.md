### When Will My Life Begin歌词：

Seven A.M. the usual morning line-up  
Start on the chores and sweep 'till the floor's all clean  
Polish and wax do laundry and mop and shine up  
Sweep again and by then it's like seven-fifteen  
And so I'll read a book  
Or maybe two or three  
I'll add a few new paintings to my gallery  
I'll play guitar and knit and cook and basically  
Just wonder when will my life begin  
Then after lunch it's puzzles and darts and baking  
Paper mache a bit of ballet and chess  
Pottery and ventriloquy candle-making  
Then I'll stretch  
Maybe sketch  
Take a climb  
Sew a dress  
And I'll be reread the books if I have time to spare  
I'll paint the walls some more  
I'm sure there's room somewhere  
And then I'll brush and brush  
And brush and brush my hair  
Stuck in the same place I've always been  
And I'll keep wonderin'  
And wonderin'  
And wonderin'  
And wonderin'  
When will my life begin  
Tomorrow night  
The lights will appear  
Just like they do on my birthday each year  
What is it like  
Out there where they glow  
Now that I'm older  
Mother might just let me go
