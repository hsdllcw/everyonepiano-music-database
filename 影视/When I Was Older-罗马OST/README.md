**When I Was Older双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_When I Was Older_ 是电影《罗马》的原声音乐，由美国女歌手Billie
Eilish演唱。电影Roma作为这首歌的灵感源泉是一部美国和墨西哥合拍的剧情片，通过描写70年代一个普通墨西哥中产家庭的生活故事，讲述了墨西哥所经历的种族鸿沟与骚乱历史。而在Billie的歌中不论是歌词还是曲调，更多的是一种“明媚的丧”，一种淡淡的忧伤及无奈，没有打雷丧的那么彻底，在丧的同时却又带着些许阳光的意味和对生活的期待，也许这就是她吸引人的点吧！

### When I Was Older歌词：

When I was older  
I was a sailor  
On an open sea  
But now I'm underwater  
And my skin is paler  
Than it should ever be  
Mhm  
I'm on my back again  
Dreaming of a time and place  
Where you and I remain the best of friends  
Even after all this ends  
Can we pretend  
I'm on my  
I'm on my back again  
It's seeming more and more  
Like all we ever do is see how far it bends  
Before it breaks in half and then  
We bend it back again  
Guess I got caught in the middle of it  
Yes I've been taught  
Got a little of it in my blood  
In my blood  
Memories burn like a forest fire  
Heavy rain turns any funeral pyre to mud  
In the flood  
When I was older  
I was a sailor  
On an open sea  
But now I'm underwater  
And my skin is paler  
Than it should ever be  
I'm watching movies back to back in black and white I never  
Seen anybody do it like I do it any better  
Been going over you I'm overdue for new endeavors  
Nobody lonely like I'm lonely and I don't know whether  
You'd really like it in the limelight  
You'd sympathize with all the bad guys  
I'm still a victim in my own right  
But I'm the villain in my own eyes  
When I was older  
I was a sailor  
On an open sea
