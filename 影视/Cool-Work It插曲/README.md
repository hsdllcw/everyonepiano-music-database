**Cool** 是美国2020年喜剧电影Work It中的插曲，由英国流行女歌手Dua Lipa演唱。被收录在其发行的第二张录音室专辑《Future
Nostalgia》，为专辑中的第3首歌曲。

该专辑将超未来电子声响结合怀旧复古迪斯科舞韵，打造舞动无休止的流行乐章
，可谓是重新塑造了2020年代的迪斯科舞曲，既有怀旧感又不和时代脱节，而这张流行之作符合杜阿•利帕敢言胸臆的个人风格，该专辑涉及到了性别与种族不平等现象以及赋权，这些内容还伴随着一些引人随时起舞的迪斯科元素，其中的大部分歌曲都散发着强烈的乐观氛围。

### Cool歌词：

Guess I never had a love like this  
Hit me harder than I ever expected  
We been up all goddamn night all night all night  
Keep it going till we see the sunlight  
And the colour of the sky looking nice o nice  
You know you know you know  
Baby I could see us in the real life  
You know you know you got  
You got me losing all my cool  
Cos I'm burning up on you  
In control of what I do  
And I love the way you move  
Got the heat and the thrill  
Give you more than any pill  
Never running out of juice  
When it's only me and you  
You got me you got me losing all my cool  
I guess we're ready for the summer  
I like us better when we're intertwined  
The way you touch me got me losing my senses  
Put your love with your lips on mine on mine on mine  
You got me working up an appetite 'tite  
And the colour of the sky looking nice o nice  
You know you know you know  
Baby I could see us in the real life  
You know you know you got  
You got me losing all my cool  
Cos I'm burning up on you  
In control of what I do  
And I love the way you move  
Got the heat and the thrill  
Give you more than any pill  
Never running out of juice  
When it's only me and you  
You got me you got me losing all my cool  
I guess we're ready for the summer  
You got me you got me losing all my cool  
I guess we're ready for the summer  
Skin tight  
I'll show you heaven there's nothing better  
I'll give it to you  
All night  
You know you know you know  
You got me losing all my cool  
Yeah you like the way I move  
In control of what I do  
And my love makes you brand new  
Got me losing all my cool  
Cos I'm burning up on you  
In control of what I do  
And I love the way you move  
Got the heat and the thrill  
Give you more than any pill  
Never running out of juice  
When it's only me and you  
When it's only me and you  
I guess we're ready for the summer  
You got me you got me losing all my cool  
I guess we're ready for the summer  
You got me you got me losing all my cool
