### I Don't Wanna Live Forever歌词：

Been sitting eyes wide open behind these four walls hoping he'd call  
It's just a cruel existence like there's no point hoping at all  
Baby baby I feel crazy  
Up all night all night and every day  
Give me something oh but you say nothing  
What is happening to me  
I don't wanna live forever 'cause I know I'll be living in vain  
And I don't wanna fit wherever  
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home  
Until you come back home  
I'm sitting eyes wide open and I got one thing stuck in my mind  
Wondering if I dodged a bullet or just lost the love of my life  
Baby baby I feel crazy  
Up all night all night and every day  
I gave you something but you gave me nothing  
What is happening to me  
I don't wanna live forever 'cause I know I'll be living in vain  
And I don't wanna fit wherever  
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home  
Until you come back home  
I've been looking sad in all the nicest places  
I see you around in all these empty faces  
Up all night all night and every day  
I've been looking sad in all the nicest places  
Now I'm in a cab I tell 'em where your place is  
I don't wanna live forever 'cause I know I'll be living in vain  
And I don't wanna fit wherever  
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home  
Until you come back home  
And I don't wanna fit wherever  
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home  
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home  
I don't wanna live forever  
'Cause I know I'll be living in vain  
And I don't wanna fit wherever  
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home  
Until you come back home  
Until you come back home
