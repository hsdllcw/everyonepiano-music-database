### Million To One歌词：

Here I go again  
I'm imagining a world outside unlike the one I'm in  
Daydreamin' again of when I'll get a chance  
There's a world that understands  
Where you don't hear the whispers in the room you're walkin' in  
Daydreamin' again all I need is a chance  
When I feel my fears staring at me  
I tell it just wait and see  
I know who I'm gonna be  
I know who I'm gonna be  
The world's half asleep  
It's gonna wake up and see  
If it's a million to one  
I'm gonna be that one and  
If it's a shot in the dark  
I'm gonna be the sun  
And I just can't afford to be wrong  
Even when I'm afraid  
You're gonna know my name  
You're gonna know my name  
I can barely sleep  
'Cause my heart is always racing chasing pacing 'round the room  
Livin' carefully is something I don't wanna do  
When I feel my fears staring at me  
I tell it just wait and see  
I know who I'm gonna be  
I know who I'm gonna be  
The world's half asleep  
It's gonna wake up and see  
If it's a million to one  
I'm gonna be that one and  
If it's a shot in the dark  
I'm gonna be the sun  
And I just can't afford to be wrong  
Even when I'm afraid  
You're gonna know my name  
You're gonna know my name  
I can see her now and then  
Wanna know what I could be yeah  
I see her laughin' 'cause she knew all along in her ahead  
So when the light is hard to see  
She's telling me  
If it's a million to one  
I'm gonna be that one and  
If it's a shot in the dark  
I'm gonna be the sun  
And I I just can't afford to be wrong  
Even when I'm afraid  
You're gonna know my name  
You're gonna know my name  
You're gonna know my name  
You're gonna know my name yeah  
You're gonna know my name  
You're gonna know my name
