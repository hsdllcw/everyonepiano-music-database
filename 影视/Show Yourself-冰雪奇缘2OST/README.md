作为电影主角艾莎人物性格转变和整部电影真相揭露的重要节点，Show
Yourself有力的扛起了这份重担。这首歌配合电影中的画面，无论是剧情上的戏剧性，演出上的表现力，还是情绪上的感染力在我看来都是整部电影的巅峰。

### Show Yourself歌词：

ELSA：  
Every inch of me is trembling  
But not from the cold  
Something is familiar  
Like a dream I can reach but not quite hold  
I can sense you there  
Like a friend I've always known  
I'm arriving  
And it feels like I am home  
I have always been a fortress  
Cold secrets deep inside  
You have secrets too  
But you don't have to hide  
Show yourself  
I'm dying to meet you  
Show yourself  
It's your turn  
Are you the one I've been looking for  
All of my life  
Show yourself  
I'm ready to learn  
Ah ah ah ah  
SIREN：  
Ah ah ah ah ah  
ELSA：  
I've never felt so certain  
All my life I've been torn  
But I'm here for a reason  
Could it be the reason I was born  
I have always been so different  
Normal rules did not apply  
Is this the day  
Are you the way  
I finally find out why  
Show yourself  
I'm no longer trembling  
Here I am  
I've come so far  
You are the answer I've waited for  
All of my life  
Oh show yourself  
Let me see who you are  
Come to me now  
Open your door  
Don't make me wait  
One moment more  
Oh come to me now  
Open your door  
Don't make me wait  
One moment more  
Where the north wind meets the sea  
IDUNA：  
Ah ah ah ah  
There's a river  
Ah ah ah ah  
Full of memory  
Come my darling homeward bound  
ELSA：  
I am found  
ELSA/IDUNA：  
Show yourself  
Step into the power  
Grow yourself  
Into something new  
IDUNA：  
You are the one you've been waiting for  
ELSA：  
All of my life  
All of your life  
ELSA：  
Oh show yourself  
Ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah ah
