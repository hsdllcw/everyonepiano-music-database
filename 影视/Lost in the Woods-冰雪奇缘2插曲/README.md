### Lost in the Woods歌词：

Kristoff：  
Again you're gone  
Off on a different path than mine  
I'm left behind  
Wondering if I should follow  
You had to go  
And of course it's always fine  
I probably could catch up with you tomorrow  
But is this what it feels like  
To be growing apart  
When did I become the one  
Who's always chasing your heart  
Now I turn around and find  
I am lost in the woods  
North is south right is left  
When you're gone  
I'm the one who sees you home  
But now I'm lost in the woods  
And I don't know what path you are on  
I'm lost in the woods  
Up 'til now  
The next step was a question of how  
I never thought it was a question of whether  
Who am I if I'm not your guy  
Where am I if we're not together  
Forever  
Now I know you're my true north  
'Cause I am lost in the woods  
Up is down day is night  
When you're not there  
Oh you're my only landmark  
So I'm lost in the woods  
Wondering if you still care  
Kristoff/Reindeer：  
But I'll wait  
For a sign  
For a sign  
That I'm your path  
'Cause you are mine  
You are mine  
Until then  
I'm lost in the woods  
Lost in the woods  
Lost in the woods  
Lost in the woods  
I'm lost in the woods  
Lost in the woods  
Lost  
Lost  
Lost  
I'm lost in the woods
