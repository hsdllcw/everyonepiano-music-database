### Song of the Sea (Lullaby)歌词：

hush now, my story  
close your eyes and sleep waltzing the waves diving the deep  
stars are shining bright the wind is on the rise whispering words of long-lost
lullabies  
oh, won't you come with me where the moon is made of gold and in the morning
sun we'll be sailing  
oh, won't you come with me where the ocean meets the sky and as the clouds
roll by we'll sing the song of the sea  
I had a dream last night  
and heard the sweetest sound I saw a great white light and dancers in the
round castles in the sand cradles in the trees  
don't cry, I'll see you by and by  
oh, won't you come with me where the moon is made of gold and in the morning
sun we'll be sailing  
oh, won't you come with me where the ocean meets the sky and as the clouds
roll by we'll sing the song of the sea  
oh, won't you come with me where the moon is made of gold and in the morning
sun we'll be sailing free  
oh, won't you come with me where the ocean meets the sky and as the clouds
roll by we'll sing the song of the sea
