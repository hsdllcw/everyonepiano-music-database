### This Is Halloween歌词：

Boys and girls of every age  
Wouldn't you like to see something strange  
Come with us and you will see  
This our town of halloween  
This is halloween this is halloween  
Pumpkins scream in the dead of night  
This is halloween everybody make a scene  
Trick or treat till the neighbors gonna die of fright  
It's our town everybody scream  
In this town of halloween  
I am the one hiding under your bed  
Teeth ground sharp and eyes glowing red  
I am the one hiding under your stairs  
Fingers like snakes and spiders in my hair  
This is halloween this is halloween  
Halloween halloween halloween halloween  
In this town we call home  
Everyone hail to the pumpkin song  
In this town don't we love it now  
Everybody's waiting for the next surprise  
Round that corner man hiding in the trash can  
Something's waiting now to pounce and how you'll  
Scream this is halloween  
Red 'n' black slimy green  
Aren't you scared  
Well that's just fine  
Say it once say it twice  
Take the chance and roll the dice  
Ride with the moon in the dead of night  
Everybody scream everybody scream  
In our town of halloween  
I am the clown with the tear away face  
Here in a flash and gone without a trace  
I am the who when you call who's there  
I am the wind blowing through your hair  
I am the shadow on the moon at night  
Filling your dreams to the brim with fright  
This is halloween this is halloween  
Halloween halloween halloween halloween  
Halloween halloween  
Tender lumplings everywhere  
Life's no fun without a good scare  
That's our job but we're not mean  
In our town of halloween  
In this town  
Don't we love it now  
Everyone's waiting for the next surprise  
Skeleton jack might catch you in the back  
And scream like a banshee  
Make you jump out of your skin  
This is halloween everyone scream  
Won't ya please make way for a very special guy  
Our man jack is king of the pumpkin patch  
Everyone hail to the pumpkin king now  
This is halloween this is halloween  
Halloween halloween halloween halloween  
In this town we call home  
Everyone hail to the pumpkin song  
La la la la  
Yeah
