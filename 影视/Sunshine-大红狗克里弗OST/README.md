### Sunshine歌词：

Running through this strange life  
Chasing all them green lights  
Throwing off the shade  
For a little bit of sunshine  
Hit me with them good vibes  
Pictures on my phone like  
Everything is so fine  
A little bit of sunshine  
Crazy lately I'm confirming  
Trynna write myself a sermon  
You just trynna get a word in life is not fair  
I been working on my tunnel vision  
Trynna get a new prescription  
Taking swings and even missing but I don't care  
Dancing more Just a little bit  
Breathing more Just a little bit  
Care a little less Just a little bit  
Like life is woo hoo  
Making more just a little bit  
Spend a little more to get rid of it  
Smile a little more and I'm into it  
Ah ah ah ah  
I've been running through this strange life  
Chasing all them green lights  
Throwing off the shade  
For a little bit of sunshine  
Hit me with them good vibes  
Pictures on my phone like  
Everything is so fine  
A little bit of sunshine  
Ahhhhhhhh ahhhhhhh  
A little bit of sunshine  
Ahhhhhhhh ahhhhhhh  
A little bit of sunshine  
Another day another selfish  
Moment I've been feeling helpless  
Sick of seeing all the selfies  
Now I don't care  
Found myself a new vocation  
Calibrated motivation  
No more static change the station  
Head to somewhere  
Dancing more Just a little bit  
Breathing more Just a little bit  
Care a little less Just a little bit  
Like life is woo hoo  
Making more just a little bit  
Spend a little more to get rid of it  
Smile a little more and I'm into it  
Ah ah ah ah  
Honestly man lately I've been  
I've been running through this strange life  
Chasing all them green lights  
Throwing off the shade  
For a little bit of sunshine  
Hit me with them good vibes  
Pictures on my phone like  
Everything is so fine  
A little bit of sunshine  
Ahhhhhhhh ahhhhhhh  
A little bit of sunshine  
Ahhhhhhhh ahhhhhhh  
A little bit of sunshine  
I don't really know any other way to say this  
Can't slow down trying to keep up with the changes  
Punch that number in the name when I clock in  
Now I feel like Michael with a cane when I walk in  
Basically life is the same thing  
Unless you don't want the same thing  
Probably shoulda went and got a feature but I didn't  
I've been saving up the money cause it's better for the business  
I've been running through this strange life  
Chasing all them green lights  
Throwing off the shade  
For a little bit of sunshine  
A little bit of sunshine  
Ahhhhhhhh ahhhhhhh  
A little bit of sunshine
