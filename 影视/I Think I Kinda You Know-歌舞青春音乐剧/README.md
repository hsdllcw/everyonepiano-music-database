### I Think I Kinda, You Know歌词：

So much has happened  
Think of what we've done  
In the time that the Earth  
Has traveled 'round the Sun  
Winter Spring Summer  
And we're back to fall  
We've been together  
Hand-in-hand through it all  
From the minute we kissed  
And my heart skipped a beat  
To the night that we danced  
I was swept off my feet  
Sure as every year has to come to an end  
I'd go spinning 'round the Sun  
With you again and again  
And again and again  
I think I kinda you know  
I think I kinda you know  
Like the way that we flow  
Like the way that we go  
And I love  
I think I kinda you know  
I think I kinda you know  
You know you know  
I can't help dreamin' of you  
Guess I'm sayin' I don't not love you  
You know you know you know
