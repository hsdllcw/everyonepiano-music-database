**River** 是Olivia Rodrigo翻唱的一首歌曲。同时也是《歌舞青春：音乐剧》中的原声音乐。

此曲原唱为加拿大创作型歌手Joni Mitchell，收录在其专辑Blue中。且成为超受欢迎的圣诞音乐之一。

《歌舞青春：音乐剧》是纪录片风格，时间设定在第一部电影推出后15年（类似真实生活时间），讲述东高一群学生设计排演音乐剧《歌舞青春》，发现戏外的抓马跟剧中一样多。

### River歌词：

Comin' on Christmas  
They're cutting down trees  
They're putting up reindeer  
And singing songs of joy and peace  
Oh I wish I had a river  
I could skate away on  
But it don't snow here  
It stays pretty green  
I'm gonna make a lotta money  
Then I'm gonna quit this crazy scene  
Oh I wish I had a river  
I could skate away on  
I wish I had a river so long  
I would teach my feet to fly  
Oh I wish I had a river  
I could skate away on  
I made my baby cry  
They tried hard to help me  
You know it put me at ease  
It left me so naughty  
Made me weak in my knees  
Oh I wish I had a river  
I could skate away on  
So hard to handle  
I'm selfish and I'm sad  
And now I've gonna lost the best baby  
That I ever had  
Oh I wish I had a river  
I could skate away on  
I wish I had a river so long  
I would teach my feet to fly  
Oh I wish I had a river  
I could skate away on  
I made my baby say goodbye  
It's coming on Christmas  
They're cutting down trees  
They're putting up reindeer  
And singing songs of joy and peace  
Oh I wish I had a river  
I could skate away on
