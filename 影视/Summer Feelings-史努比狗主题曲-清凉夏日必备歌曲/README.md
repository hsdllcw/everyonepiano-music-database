### Summer Feelings歌词：

Lennon Stella：  
I hear the rhythm of waves hitting on the shore  
And I can swear they're speaking speaking speaking  
They're telling me to relax I'm not good at that  
But now I know I need it need it need it  
I slide  
Ooh now what you do  
My tan lines tell the truth  
I slide  
Yeah on Venice Beach  
Got sand all in my shoes  
Tonight  
Ooh unlock me loose  
See the sunset from the roof  
That's right  
Yeah that crystal blue  
And I came out someone new  
Hey gettin' in my summer feelings  
And I'm trying to keep it cool  
Way up here in my summer feelings  
And I found a piece of me that I never knew  
Charlie Puth：  
You got my heart and I'm head over heels in love  
In California dreamin' dreamin' dreamin' yeah  
Touching the stars and then dragging them down to earth  
Like California feeling feeling feeling  
I slide  
Ooh now what you do  
Your brown eyes tell the truth  
I slide  
Yeah down on the beach  
I'm staying out late for you  
Tonight  
Ooh unlock ya loose  
See the sunset from the roof  
That's right  
Yeah you're good to me  
And I came out someone new  
Hey gettin' in my summer feelings  
Summer feelings  
And I I'm trying to keep it cool  
Way up here in my summer feelings  
And I I found a piece of me that I never knew  
Lennon Stella：  
I'm melting like ice cream  
The stress is gone for me  
Nowhere I'd rather be  
Both：  
Hey gettin' in my summer feelings  
And I I'm trying to keep it cool  
Way up here in my summer feelings  
And I found a piece of me that I never knew  
Hey gettin' in my summer feelings  
And I I'm trying to keep it cool  
Way up here in my summer feelings  
And I found a piece of me that I never knew
