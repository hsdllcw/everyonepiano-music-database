**Into the Unknown双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Into the Unknown_ 是《冰雪奇缘2》的新单曲。此曲依然由上一部主题曲《Let It
go》的奥斯卡原班制作人打造，继续由伊迪娜•门泽尔演唱。但这首歌的传唱性并没有前作高，很难超越经典。该部影剧主要讲述了艾莎听到召唤，然后面对挑战，和同伴一起解决麻烦，最后大团圆的故事。

### Into the Unknown歌词：

Ah ah oh oh  
Ah ah oh oh  
Ah ah oh oh oh oh  
I can hear you but I won't  
Some look for trouble while others don't  
There's a thousand reasons I should go about my day  
And ignore your whispers which I wish would go away oh oh  
Oh oh  
Ah ah oh oh  
You're not a voice  
You're just a ringing in my ear  
And if I heard you which I don't  
I'm spoken for I fear  
Everyone I've ever loved is here within these walls  
I'm sorry secret siren but I'm blocking out your calls  
I've had my adventure I don't need something new  
I'm afraid of what I'm risking if I follow you  
Into the unknown  
Into the unknown  
Into the unknown  
Ah ah oh oh  
Ah ah oh oh oh  
What do you want 'Cause you've been keeping me awake  
Are you here to distract me so I make a big mistake  
Or are you someone out there who's a little bit like me  
Who knows deep down I'm not where I'm meant to be  
Every day's a little harder as I feel my power grow  
Don't you know there's part of me that longs to go  
Into the unknown  
Into the unknown  
Into the unknown  
Ah ah oh oh  
Ah ah oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Are you out there  
Do you know me  
Can you feel me  
Can you show me  
Ah ah oh oh  
Ah ah oh oh  
Ah ah oh oh  
Ah ah oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh  
Where are you going  
Don't leave me alone  
How do I follow you  
Into the unknown
