**Out of the Black双手简谱** 和五线谱完全对应。

_Out of the Black_ 是Royal
Blood演唱的歌曲，同时也是推理片《我是谁：没有绝对安全的系统》的插曲。影片讲述了主人公本杰明和麦克斯、史蒂芬、保罗组建了黑客组织CLAY，并引起德国警察、俄罗斯黑帮的注意的故事。这部独立制片的成本不高，把黑客世界描绘成另一个武侠江湖，同样用到现实与虚拟来区分黑客在现实和网络的二次元世界，黑客用攻陷防范级别越来越高的网络系统来区分江湖地位，但原来最具挑战的系统是人心，没有比人心更难的安防系统。

### Out of the Black歌词：

How did it feel  
When it came alive and took you  
Out of the black  
It broke your skin and shook through  
Every part of me every part of you  
You made a fool out of me  
And took the skin off my back running  
So don't breathe when I talk  
'Cause you haven't been spoken to  
I got a gun for a mouth and a bullet  
With your name on it  
But a sliver for a heart beating blood  
From an empty pocket  
I never wondered why  
And you didn't care when  
You closed every day  
I washed away your sin  
And I promised you  
Like you promised me  
That those vows we made  
We f**ked them up for free  
You made a fool out of me  
And took the skin off my back running  
So don't breathe when I talk  
'Cause you haven't been spoken to  
I got a gun for a mouth and a bullet  
With your name on it  
But a sliver for a heart beating blood  
From an empty pocket  
You made a fool out of me  
And took the skin off my back running  
So don't breathe when I talk  
'Cause you haven't been spoken to  
I got a gun for a mouth and a bullet  
With your name on it  
But a sliver for a heart beating blood  
From an empty pocket  
And it's hard this world  
Never let's you go  
Deals your cards right here
