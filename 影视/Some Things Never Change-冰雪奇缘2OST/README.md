### Some Things Never Change歌词：

ANNA：  
Yes the wind blows a little bit colder  
And we're all getting older  
And the clouds are moving on with every autumn breeze  
Peter Pumpkin just became fertilizer  
OLAF：  
And my leaf's a little sadder and wiser  
ANNA：  
That's why I rely on certain certainties  
Yes some things never change  
Like the feel of your hand in mine  
Some things stay the same  
ANNA/OLAF：  
Like how we get along just fine  
ANNA：  
Like an old stone wall that'll never fall  
Some things are always true  
Some things never change  
Like how I'm holding on tight to you  
KRISTOFF：  
The leaves are already falling  
Sven it feels like the future is calling  
Are you telling me tonight you're gonna get down on one knee  
Yeah bud I'm really bad at planning these things out  
Like candlelight and pulling of rings out  
Maybe you should leave all the romantic stuff to me  
Yeah some things never change  
Like the love that I feel for her  
Some things stay the same  
Like how reindeers are easier  
But if I commit and I go for it  
I'll know what to say and do  
Right  
Some things never change  
Sven the pressure is all on you  
ELSA：  
The winds are restless  
Could that be why I'm hearing this call  
Is something coming  
I'm not sure I want things to change at all  
These days are precious  
Can't let them slip away  
I can't freeze this moment  
But I can still go out and seize this day  
Ah ah ah ah ah ah  
The wind blows a little bit colder  
OLAF：  
And you all look a little bit older  
ANNA：  
It's time to count our blessings  
ANNA/KRISTOFF：  
Beneath an autumn sky  
We're always living the kingdom aplenty  
That stands for the good and the many  
ELSA：  
And I promise you the flag of Arendelle will always fly  
ANNA：  
Our flag will always fly  
Our flag will always fly  
Our flag will always fly  
Both：  
Some things never change  
Turn around and the time has flown  
Some things stay the same  
Though the future remains unknown  
May our good luck last  
May our past be past  
Time's moving fast it's true  
Some things never change  
ANNA：  
And I'm holding on tight to you  
ELSA：  
Holding on tight to you  
OLAF：  
Holding on tight to you  
KRISTOFF：  
Holding on tight to you  
ANNA：  
I'm holding on tight to you
