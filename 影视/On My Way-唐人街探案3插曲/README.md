### On My Way歌词：

Feeling so quiet  
This time  
Into the darkness  
Let me be endless  
Goodbye  
End of my old life  
No one is luckless  
When comes the fairness  
Through the dark a world is waiting  
Through where no one's ever looking  
A place that will be called my own  
So trade that typical for something  
New and colorful like you say  
Everything will not be the same  
When the shadows fall keep cutting me down  
I've learned to be ashamed with my scars  
If I meant to be disowned and disgraced  
I will burst out of cage through all the barricades  
I'll be on my way  
I'll be on my way  
Feed my blood to be warrior  
Next life  
So quiet  
This time  
Drift into darkness  
Let me be endless  
Goodbye  
End of my old life  
No one is luckless  
When comes the fairness  
Through the dark a world is waiting  
Through where no one's ever looking  
A place that will be called my own  
So trade that typical for something  
New and colorful like you say  
Everything will not stay the same  
When the shadows fall keep cutting me down  
I've learned to be ashamed with my scars  
If I meant to be disowned and disgraced  
I will burst out of cage through all the barricades  
I'll be on my way  
I'll be on my way  
Feed my blood to be warrior  
I'll be on my way  
I'll be on my way  
Feed my blood to be warrior  
I'll be on my way  
I'll be on my way  
Feed my blood to be warrior  
My next life
