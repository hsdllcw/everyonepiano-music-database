### Helpless歌词：

Ohh I do I do I do I dooo hey  
Ohh I do I do I do I dooo boy you got me  
Helpless  
Look into your eyes and the sky's the limit I'm  
Helpless  
Down for the count and I'm drownin' in em  
I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight  
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night  
Laughin' at my sister as she's dazzling the room  
Then you walked in and my heart went  
Boom  
Tryin' to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom  
Everybody's dancin' and the band's top volume  
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine  
Grab my sister and whisper  
Yo this one's mine oooh  
My sister made her way across the room to you oooh  
And I got nervous thinking  
What's she gonna do oooh  
She grabs you by the arm I'm thinkin'  
I'm through oooh  
Then you look back at me and suddenly I'm  
Helpless  
Look into your eyes oh look at those eyes  
And the sky's the limit oh  
I'm helpless I know  
Down for the count  
And I'm drownin' in em  
I'm helpless I'm so into you  
Look into your eyes I'am so  
And the sky's the limit into you  
I'm helpless I know  
I'm down for the count  
And I'm drownin'in em  
One week later  
I'm writin' a letter nightly  
Now my life gets better  
Every letter that you write me  
Laughin' at my sister cuz she wants to form a harem  
I'm just sayin' if you really loved me  
You would share him  
Ha two weeks later  
In the living room stressin'  
My father's stonefaced  
While you're asking for his blessin'  
I'm dying inside as you wine and dine  
And I'm tryin' not to cry cause  
There's nothing that your mind can't do oooh  
My father makes his way across the room to you oooh  
I panic for a second thinking  
We're through oooh  
But then he shakes your hand and says  
Be true oooh  
And you turn back to me smiling and I'm  
Helpless  
Look into your eyes  
And the sky's the limit I'm  
Helpless  
Hoo down for the count  
And I'm drownin' in em I'm  
Helpless  
He's mine that boy is mine  
Look into your eyes  
And the sky's the limit I'm  
Helpless helpless  
Down for the count and I'm drownin'in em  
Eliza I don't have a dollar to my name  
An acre of land a troop to command  
A dollop of fame  
All I have's my honor a tolerance for pain  
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain  
Insane your family brings out a different side of me  
Peggy confides in me angelica tried to take a bite of me  
No stress my love for you is never in doubt  
We'll get a little place in harlem and we'll figure it out  
I've been livin' without a family since I was a child  
My father left my mother died I grew up buckwild  
But I'll never forget my mother's face that was real  
And long as I'm alive eliza swear to god you'll never feel so  
Helpless I do I do I do I do  
Eliza helpless  
I do I do I do I do  
I've never felt so  
Helpless hey yeah yeah  
Down for the count and  
I'm drownin' in em down for the count I'm  
My life is gon' be fine cuz eliza's in it  
I look into your eyes and the sky's the limit I'm helpless  
Down for the count  
And I'm drownin' in em  
In New York you can be a new man  
In New York you can be a new man  
In New York you can be a new man  
Helpless
