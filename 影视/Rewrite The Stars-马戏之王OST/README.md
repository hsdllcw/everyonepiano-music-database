_Rewrite The Stars_ 是电影马戏之王的插曲，Zac
Efron与Zendaya共同演绎。《马戏之王》这部影片载歌载舞106分钟，比起典型的百老汇音乐剧动辄近两个半小时的时长，当然是太急就章。情节催谷音乐，音乐带动情节，电影的起承转合，算得上一气呵成。过渡性的转场桥段，稍纵即逝，并不给观众留白。该片行云流水的故事编排，镜头机位的架设角度，意图让观众如身临音乐剧表演的现场，并沉醉其中。电影并不力图复古，主题更是以纯当代的视角“重塑”历史——影片本来也不是传记片，但还是多少让无缘亲临百老汇与好莱坞最黄金年代盛世的当代观众，有了追想往昔巨星们风华的机会。

### Rewrite The Stars歌词：

Zac Efron：  
You know I want you  
It's not a secret I try to hide  
I know you want me  
So don't keep saying our hands are tied  
You claim it's not in the cards  
But fate is pulling you miles away  
And out of reach from me  
But you're here in my heart  
So who can stop me if I decide  
That you're my destiny  
What if we rewrite the stars  
Say you were made to be mine  
Nothing could keep us apart  
You'd be the one I was meant to find  
It's up to you and it's up to me  
No one can say what we get to be  
So why don't we rewrite the stars  
Maybe the world could be ours  
Tonight  
Zendaya：  
You think it's easy  
You think I don't want to run to you  
But there are mountains  
And there are doors that we can't walk through  
I know you're wondering why  
Because we're able to be  
Just you and me  
Within these walls  
But when we go outside  
You're going to wake up and see that it was hopeless after all  
No one can rewrite the stars  
How can you say you'll be mine  
Everything keeps us apart  
And I'm not the one you were meant to find  
It's not up to you  
It's not up to me  
When everyone tells us what we can be  
How can we rewrite the stars  
Say that the world can be ours  
Tonight  
Both：  
All I want is to fly with you  
All I want is to fall with you  
So just give me all of you  
Zendaya：  
It feels impossible  
Zac Efron：  
It's not impossible  
Zendaya：  
Is it impossible  
Both：  
Say that it's possible  
How do we rewrite the stars  
Say you were made to be mine  
Nothing can keep us apart  
Cause you are the one I was meant to find  
It's up to you  
And it's up to me  
No one can say what we get to be  
And why don't we rewrite the stars  
Changing the world to be ours  
Zendaya：  
You know I want you  
It's not a secret I try to hide  
But I can't have you  
We're bound to break and my hands are tied
