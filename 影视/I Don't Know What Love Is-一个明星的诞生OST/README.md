### I Don't Know What Love Is歌词：

Lady Gaga：  
I don't know what love is  
If I can't have you here  
I don't know what love is  
I think that it's just fear  
Both：  
I don't know the tempo  
Of my heart's concerto  
It's all seems like a dream  
It's not I know  
There's something real out there for me  
I swear I've seen an angel  
A paradise in blue  
Every color I choose  
But I don't know what love is  
But I think it might be you  
Bradley Cooper：  
If I had the courage  
I'd know just what to do  
Sometimes I have to crawl  
And everyday I fall  
Tryin' just to stand by you  
Both：  
I swear I've seen an angel  
A paradise in blue  
Every color I choose  
But I don't know what love is  
But I think it might be you
