### Share Your Address歌词：

Darling you might think it's too soon  
But I can't get you out of my head now  
Picturing myself in your room  
And I wanna be with you 'til I'm dead now  
I want your friends to be my friends  
I'll make you breakfast in your bed  
I want it all with you  
And if I'm coming on too strong  
It's 'cause I've waited far too long  
For someone just like you  
I want a key to your house  
I wanna pick up your clothes  
I wanna clean up your mess  
I wanna know where you hide things  
Wanna be in your photos  
Wanna share your address  
I know I know it's too soon too fast  
But this could last  
I wanna share your address  
I know I know it it feels like love  
So let's shack up  
I wanna share your address  
I just wanna stare at your face  
Then spend quality time with your mother  
We can over-drink at your favorite place  
And we can waste the whole next day to recover  
I wanna watch you while you sleep  
I know I might sound like a creep  
But I can't help myself  
And it's so easy to forget  
That we've barely even met  
But I want no one else  
I want no one else  
I want a key to your house  
I wanna pick up your clothes  
I wanna clean up your mess  
I wanna know where you hide things  
Wanna be in your photos  
Wanna share your address  
I know I know it's too soon too fast  
But this could last  
I wanna share your address  
I know I know it it feels like love  
So let's shack up  
I wanna share your address  
I wanna be your emergency contact  
You can put me down  
'Cause you know I know you best  
I know you best  
It doesn't matter where I go  
Without you I'll never be home  
I wanna share your address  
I wanna be your emergency contact  
You can put me down  
'Cause you know I know you best  
I know you best  
It doesn't matter where I go  
Without you I'll never be home  
I wanna share your address  
I want a key to your house  
I wanna pick up your clothes  
I wanna clean up your mess  
I wanna know where you hide things  
Wanna be in your photos  
Wanna share your address  
I know I know it's too soon too fast  
But this could last  
I wanna share your address  
I know I know it it feels like love  
So let's shack up  
I wanna share your address
