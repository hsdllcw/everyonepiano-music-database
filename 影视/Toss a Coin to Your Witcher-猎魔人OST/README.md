### Toss a Coin to Your Witcher歌词：

When a humble bard  
Graced a ride along  
With Geralt of Rivia  
Along came this song  
From when the White Wolf fought  
A silver-tongued devil  
His army of elves  
At his hooves did they revel  
They came after me  
With masterful deceit  
Broke down my lute  
And they kicked in my teeth  
While the devil's horns  
Minced our tender meat  
And so cried the Witcher  
He can't be bleat  
Toss a coin to your Witcher  
O Valley of Plenty  
O Valley of Plenty oh  
Toss a coin to Your Witcher  
O Valley of Plenty  
At the edge of the world  
Fight the mighty horde  
That bashes and breaks you  
And brings you to mourn  
He thrust every elf  
Far back on the shelf  
High up on the mountain  
From whence it came  
He wiped out your pest  
Got kicked in his chest  
He's a friend of humanity  
So give him the rest  
That's my epic tale  
Our champion prevailed  
Defeated the villain  
Now pour him some ale  
Toss a coin to your Witcher  
Oh Valley of Plenty  
Oh Valley of Plenty oh  
Toss a coin to your Witcher  
A friend of humanity  
Toss a coin to your Witcher  
Oh Valley of Plenty  
Oh Valley of Plenty oh  
Toss a coin to your Witcher  
A friend of humanity  
Toss a coin to your Witcher  
Oh Valley of Plenty  
Oh Valley of Plenty oh  
Toss a coin to your Witcher  
A friend of humanity
