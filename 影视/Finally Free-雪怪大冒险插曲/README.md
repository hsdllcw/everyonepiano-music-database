### Finally Free歌词：

Standing here on my own  
Yeah the first step's the hardest when you're walking into the unknown  
It's been dark and it's been cold  
Had my head in the clouds never knowing what lies down below  
Then you spoke your truth with no secrets  
Told me use your heart while it's beating  
When you're right here beside me there's nothing else I need  
Your eyes keep me reminded that nothing's out of reach  
When you're with me it feels like I'm finally free  
Feels like I'm finally free  
I didn't know didn't know what was real  
Had to go to the edge and the ground just to see how it feels  
Then you spoke your truth with no secrets  
Told me use your heart while it's beating  
When you're right here beside me there's nothing else I need  
Yeah your eyes keep me reminded that nothing's out of reach  
When you're with me it feels like I'm finally free  
Wo woo  
Feel's like I'm finally free  
I used to spend the nights looking at the stars  
Wondering how to get there is it just too far  
I used to spend the nights looking at the stars  
Wondering how to get there is it just too far  
But when you're right here beside me there's nothing else I need  
Yeah your eyes keep me reminded that nothing's out of reach  
It's easy to believe  
When you're with me it feels like I'm finally free  
Oh yeah  
It feels like I'm finally free  
Wo woo  
It feels like I'm finally free
