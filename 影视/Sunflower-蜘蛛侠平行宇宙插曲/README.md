### Sunflower歌词：

Ayy ayy ayy ayy  
Ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh  
Ayy ayy  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Needless to say I keep it in check  
She was all bad-bad nevertheless  
Yeah  
Callin' it quits now baby I'm a wreck  
Wreck  
Crash at my place baby you're a wreck  
Wreck  
Needless to say I'm keeping her in check  
She was all bad-bad nevertheless  
Callin' it quits now baby I'm a wreck  
Crash at my place baby you're a wreck  
Thinkin' in a bad way losin' your grip  
Screamin' at my face baby don't trip  
Someone took a big L don't know how that felt  
Lookin' at you sideways party on tilt  
Ooh ooh some things you just can't refuse  
She wanna ride me like a cruise and I'm not tryna lose  
Then you're left in the dust unless I stuck by ya  
You're the sunflower  
I think your love would be too much  
Or you'll be left in the dust unless I stuck by ya  
You're the sunflower you're the sunflower  
Post Malone：  
Every time I'm leavin' on ya  
Ooh you don't make it easy no  
No no  
Wish I could be there for ya  
Give me a reason to  
Oh  
Every time I'm walkin' out  
Oh  
I can hear you tellin' me to turn around  
Oh oh  
Fightin' for my trust and you won't back down  
No  
Even if we gotta risk it all right now oh  
Now  
I know you're scared of the unknown  
-Known  
You don't wanna be alone  
Alone  
I know I always come and go  
And go  
But it's out of my control  
And you'll be left in the dust unless I stuck by ya  
You're the sunflower  
I think your love would be too much  
Or you'll be left in the dust unless I stuck by ya  
You're the sunflower you're the sunflower yeah yeah
