### All I Want歌词：

I found a guy told me I was a star  
He held the door held my hand in the dark  
And he's perfect on paper but he's lying to my face  
Does he think that I'm the  
Kinda girl who needs to be saved  
And there's one more boy he's from my past  
We fell in love but it didn't last  
'Cause the second I figure it out he pushes me away  
And I won't fight for love if you won't meet me halfway  
And I say that I'm through but this song's still for you  
All I want is love that lasts  
Is all I want too much to ask  
Is it something wrong with me  
All I want is a good guy  
Are my expectations far too high  
Try my best but what can I say  
All I have is myself at the end of the day  
But shouldn't that be enough for me  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
And I miss the days when I was young and naive  
I thought the perfect guy would come and find me  
Now happy ever after it don't come so easily  
All I want is love that lasts  
Is all I want too much to ask  
Is it something wrong with me oh ooh  
All I want is a good guy  
Are my expectations far too high  
Try my best but what can I say  
All I have is myself at the end of the day  
And all I want is for that to be okay
