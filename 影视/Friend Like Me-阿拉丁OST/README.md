_Friend Like Me_
出自迪士尼出品的爱情奇幻冒险片《阿拉丁》。电影充满了奇幻的特效场面，但却将重点放在人的身上，放在对人物的塑造和对人物情感关系的营造上，它代表的是好莱坞对传统叙事的回归。它在有些方面是对动画版的“真人”化，但是又加入了一些新的特色。

### Friend Like Me歌词：

Here I go  
Unh ooh woo  
Back up Uh-oh watch out Unh  
You done wound me up  
Boutta show you what I'm workin' with unh  
Well Ali Baba he had them forty thieves  
Scheherazade had a thousand tales  
But master you're in luck because up your sleeves  
You got a brand of magic never fails  
You got some power in your corner now  
Heavy ammunition in your camp  
You got some punch pizazz yahoo and how  
All you gotta do is rub that lamp  
And then I'll say  
Mr. Man what's your name whatever  
What will your pleasure be  
Let me take your order I'll jot it down  
You ain't never had a friend like me  
Life is your restaurant  
And I'm your maitre d'  
Come whisper to me whatever it is you want  
You ain't never had a friend like me  
We pride ourselves on service  
You the boss the king the shah  
Say what you wish it's yours true dish  
How about a little more baklava  
Have some of column A  
Try all of column B  
I'm in the mood to help you dude  
You ain't never had a friend like me  
Oh Unh  
It's the big part watch out  
It's the big part oh  
Can your friends do this  
Can your friends do that  
Can your friends pull this  
Outta they little hat  
Can your friends go  
I'm the genie of the lamp  
I can sing rap dance if you give me a chance oh  
Don't sit there buggy-eyed  
I'm here to answer all your midday prayers  
You got me bona fide certified  
You got a genie for your charge d'affaires  
I got a powerful urge to help you out  
So what's your wish I really wanna know  
You got a list that's three miles long no doubt  
Well all you gotta do is rub like so  
Mister  
Aladdin  
Yes  
One wish or two or three  
Well I'm on the job you big nabob  
You ain't never had a friend never had a friend you ain't  
Never had a friend never had a friend  
You ain't never
