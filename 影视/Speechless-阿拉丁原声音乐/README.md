### Speechless歌词：

Here comes a wave  
Meant to wash me away  
A tide that is taking me under  
Swallowing sand  
Left with nothing to say  
My voice drowned out in the thunder  
But I won't cry  
And I won't start to crumble  
Whenever they try  
To shut me or cut me down  
I won't be silenced  
You can't keep me quiet  
Won't tremble when you try it  
All I know is I won't go speechless  
Cause I'll breathe  
When they try to suffocate me  
Don't you underestimate me  
Cause I know that I won't go speechless  
Written in stone  
Every rule every word  
Centuries old and unbending  
Stay in your place  
Better seen and not heard  
But now that story is ending  
Cause I  
I cannot start to crumble  
So come on and try  
Try to shut me and cut me down  
I won't be silenced  
You can't keep me quiet  
Won't tremble when you try it  
All I know is I won't go speechless  
Speechless  
Let the storm in  
I cannot be broken  
No I won't live unspoken  
Cause I know that I won't go speechless  
Try to lock me in this cage  
I won't just lay me down and die  
I will take these broken wings  
And watch me burn across the sky  
Here the echoes saying I  
Won't be silenced  
Though you wanna see me tremble when you try it  
All I know is I won't go speechless  
Speechless  
Cause I'll breathe  
When they try to suffocate me  
Don't you underestimate me  
Cause I know that I won't go speechless  
All I know is I won't go speechless  
Speechless
