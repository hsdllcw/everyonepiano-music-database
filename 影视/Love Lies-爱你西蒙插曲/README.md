### Love Lies歌词：

Sorry if it's hard to catch my vibe mmm  
I need a lover to trust tell me you're on my side  
Are you down for the ride  
It's not easy for someone to catch my eye  
But I've been waitin' for you for my whole d**n life  
For my whole lifetime  
Don't be afraid to tell me if you ain't with it  
You ain't with it  
I see you're focused yeah you're so independent  
Independent  
It's hard for me to open up I'll admit it  
I'll admit it  
You've got some sh*t to say and I'm here to listen  
So baby tell me where your love lies  
Waste the day and spend the night  
Underneath the sunrise  
Show me where your love lies  
I've been so into your mystery  
Is it because of our history  
Are you into me  
When it feels so good but it's bad for you  
Can't say I don't want it 'cause I know I do  
Come on over I need your company  
Cravin' that synergy  
Don't be afraid to tell me if you ain't with it  
You ain't with it  
I see you're focused yeah you're so independent  
Independent  
It's hard for me to open up I'll admit it  
I'll admit it  
You've got some sh*t to say and I'm here to listen  
So baby tell me where your love lies  
Waste the day and spend the night  
Underneath the sunrise  
Show me where your love lies  
Tell me where your love lies  
Waste the day and spend the night  
Underneath the sunrise  
Show me where your love lies  
If you're down don't hide it  
Feelin' me you don't gotta deny it  
Baby you gon' make me overnight it  
Tell me are you down  
If you're down don't hide it yeah  
Feelin' me you don't gotta deny it yeah  
Baby you gon' make me overnight it  
Tell me are you down tell me  
Tell me where your love lies  
Tell me where your love lies  
Waste the day and spend the night  
Waste the day spend the night  
Underneath the sunrise  
Underneath the sunrise  
Show me where your love lies  
Tell me where your love lies  
Tell me where your love lies  
Show me where your love lies  
Waste the day and spend the night yeah yeah  
Underneath the sunrise ooh  
Show me where your love lies
