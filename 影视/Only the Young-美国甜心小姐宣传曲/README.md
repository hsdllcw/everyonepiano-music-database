### Only the Young歌词：

It keeps me awake  
The look on your face  
The moment you heard the news  
You're screaming inside  
And frozen in time  
You did all that you could do  
The game was rigged the ref got tricked  
The wrong ones think they're right  
You were outnumbered this time  
But only the young  
Only the young  
Only the young  
Only the young can run  
Can run so run  
And run and run  
So every day now  
You brace for the sound  
You've only heard on TV  
You go to class scared  
Wondering where the best hiding spot would be  
And the big bad man and his big bad clan  
Their hands are stained with red  
Oh how quickly they forget  
They aren't gonna help us  
Too busy helping themselves  
They aren't gonna change this  
We gotta do it ourselves  
They think that it's over  
But it's just begun  
Only one thing can save us  
Only the young  
Only the young  
Only the young  
Only the young  
Only the young  
Only the young  
Only the young  
Only the young  
Only the young  
Only the young  
Only the young  
Only the young  
Only the young  
Only the young  
Only the young  
Only the young  
Only the young  
Only the young  
Only the young  
Only the young  
Only the young  
Can run  
Don't say you're too tired to fight  
It's just a matter of time  
Can run  
Up there's the finish line  
So run and run and run  
Don't say you're too tired to fight  
It's just a matter of time  
So run  
Up there's the finish line  
And run and run and run  
Only the young  
Only the young  
Only the young
