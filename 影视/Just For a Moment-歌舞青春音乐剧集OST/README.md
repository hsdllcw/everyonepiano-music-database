### Just For a Moment歌词：

I fell in love  
With the only girl who knows what I'm about  
I fell in love  
With a boy and I can't tell if I fell out  
After all is said and done  
I can't just pretend I'm movin' on  
Is it just a part we're playing  
'Cause it don't feel like we're faking  
When we're underneath the lights  
My heart's no longer broken  
For a moment  
Just for a moment  
When we're singing side by side  
There's so much left unspoken  
For a moment  
Just for a moment  
A moment in love  
Just for a moment  
A moment in love  
Just for a moment  
But is a moment enough  
Way way back then  
Always dreamed it's you and me  
'Til the end  
Now we can't play pretend  
And I'm scared to talk to my best friend  
Should I stay or let you go  
Will ya love me when the curtains close  
Is it just a part we're playing  
'Cause it don't feel like we're faking  
When we're underneath the lights  
My heart's no longer broken  
For a moment  
Just for a moment  
When we're singing side by side  
There's so much left unspoken  
For a moment  
Just for a moment  
A moment in love  
Just for a moment  
A moment in love  
Just for a moment  
But is a moment enough  
Maybe your heart still stops  
When you see me  
Maybe it's worth another try  
Better place better time  
When we're underneath the lights  
My heart's no longer broken  
For a moment  
Just for a moment  
When we're singing side by side  
There's so much left unspoken  
For a moment  
Just for a moment  
A moment in love  
Just for a moment  
A moment in love  
Just for a moment  
But is a moment enough  
When we're underneath the lights  
My heart's no longer broken  
For a moment  
Just for a moment
