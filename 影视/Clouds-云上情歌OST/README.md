### Clouds歌词：

I fell down down down  
Into this dark and lonely hole  
There was no one there to  
Care about me anymore  
And I needed a way  
To climb and grab a hold  
Of the edge you were sitting there  
Holding a rope  
And we'll go up up up  
But I'll fly a little higher  
Go up in the clouds  
Because the view's a little nicer  
Up here my dear  
It won't be long now  
It won't be long now  
When we get back on land  
Well I'll never get my chance  
Be ready to live  
And it'll be ripped right out of my hands  
And maybe someday  
We'll take a little ride  
We'll go up up up  
And everything will be just fine  
And we'll go up up up  
But I'll fly a little higher  
Go up in the clouds  
Because the view's a little nicer  
Up here my dear  
It won't be long now  
It won't be long now  
If only  
I had a little bit more time  
If only  
I had a little bit more time with you  
We could go up up up  
And take that little ride  
We'll sit there holding hands  
And everything will be just right  
And maybe someday  
I'll see you again  
We'll float up in the clouds  
And we'll never see the end  
And we'll go up up up  
But I'll fly a little higher  
Go up in the clouds  
Because the view's a little nicer  
Up here my dear  
It won't be long now  
It won't be long now
