### Love Is An Open Door歌词：

Anna: Okay, can I just, say something crazy?

Hans: I love crazy!

Anna: All my life has been a series of doors in my face  
And then suddenly I bumped into you

Hans: I was thinking the same thing! 'Cause like  
I've been searching my whole life to find my own place  
And maybe it's the party talking or the chocolate fondue

Anna: But with you  
Hans: But with you

Hans: I found my place  
Anna: I see your face

Both: And it's nothing like I've ever known before....  
Love is an open door  
Love is an open door  
Love is an open door.

Anna: With you  
Hans: With you  
Anna: With you  
Hans: With you

Both: Love is an open door

Hans: I mean it's crazy  
Anna: What?

Hans: We finish each other's  
Anna: Sandwiches

Hans: That's what I was gonna say!

Anna: I've never met someone

Both: Who thinks so much like me  
Jinx! Jinx again!  
Our mental synchronization  
Can have but one explanation

Hans: You  
Anna: And I  
Hans: Were  
Anna: Just

Both: Meant to be

Anna: Say goodbye  
Hans: Say goodbye

Both: To the pain of the past  
We don't have to feel it any more  
Love is an open door  
Love is an open door  
Life can be so much more

Anna:  
With you  
Hans:  
With you  
Anna:  
With you  
Hans:  
With you

Both:  
Love is an open door

Hans:  
Can I say something crazy? Will you marry me?  
Anna:  
Can I say something even crazier? Yes!
