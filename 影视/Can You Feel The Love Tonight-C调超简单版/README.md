《 **Can You Feel the Love Tonight** 》是由英国歌手Elton
John演唱的一首歌曲，收录于1994年5月31日发行的《狮子王》电影原声带专辑中。

该曲融合了恢弘的交响乐、西方的流行乐和非洲土著音乐的独特旋律与节奏，磅礴音乐中渗透出满满的柔情。《 _Can You Feel the Love
Tonight_ 》堪称是“迪斯尼动画复兴”时期的巅峰之作。

该曲是一首情歌，而情歌往往与成人世界关联，但勾勒童话世界的动画电影《狮子王》却将该曲运用的相当完美，与剧中人物匹配协调。电影中这首深情款款的主题曲，即使在多年以后，听来依然打动人心、情感诚挚。

### Can You Feel the Love Tonight歌词：

There’s a calm surrender to the rush of day  
When the heat of the rolling wind can be turned away  
An enchanted moment，and it sees me through  
It’s enough for this restless warrior just to be with you  
Chorus:  
And can you feel the love tonight  
It is where we are  
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer  
That we got this far  
And can you feel the love tonight  
How it’s laid to rest  
It’s enough to make kings and vagabonds  
Believe the very best  
There’s a time for everyone if they only learn  
That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn  
There’s a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors  
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours  
And can you feel the love tonight?  
It is where we are  
It's enough for this wide eyed wanderer  
That we got this far  
And can you feel the love tonight?  
How it's laid to rest  
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds  
Believe the very best  
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds  
Believe the very best
