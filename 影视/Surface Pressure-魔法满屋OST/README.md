### Surface Pressure歌词：

I'm the strong one  
I'm not nervous  
I'm as tough as the crust of the earth is  
I move mountains  
I move churches  
And I glow 'cause I know what my worth is  
I don't ask how hard the work is  
Got a rough indestructible surface  
Diamonds and platinum I find 'em I flatten 'em  
I take what I'm handed I break what's demanded but  
Under the surface  
I feel berserk as a tightrope walker in a three-ring circus  
Under the surface  
Was Hercules ever like &quot;Yo I don't wanna fight Cerberus&quot;  
Under the surface  
I'm pretty sure I'm worthless if I can't be of service  
A flaw or a crack  
The straw in the stack  
That breaks the camel's back  
What breaks the camel's back  
It's pressure like a drip drip drip that'll never stop whoa  
Pressure that'll tip tip tip 'til you just go pop whoa-uh-uh  
Give it to your sister your sister's older  
Give her all the heavy things we can't shoulder  
Who am I if I can't run with the ball  
If I fall to  
Pressure like a grip grip grip and it won't let go whoa  
Pressure like a tick tick tick 'til it's ready to blow whoa-uh-uh  
Give it to your sister your sister's stronger  
See if she can hang on a little longer  
Who am I if I can't carry it all  
If I falter  
Under the surface  
I hide my nerves and it worsens I worry something is gonna hurt us  
Under the surface  
The ship doesn't swerve as it heard how big the iceberg is  
Under the surface  
I think about my purpose  
Can I somehow preserve this  
Line up the dominoes  
A light wind blows  
You try to stop it tumbling  
But on and on it goes  
But wait  
If I could shake the crushing weight  
Of expectations would that free some room up for joy  
Or relaxation  
Or simple pleasure  
Instead we measure this growing pressure  
Keeps growing keep going  
'Cause all we know is  
Pressure like a drip drip drip that'll never stop woah  
Pressure that'll tip tip tip 'til you just go pop woah-oh-oh  
Give it to your sister it doesn't hurt and  
See if she can handle every family burden  
Watch as she buckles and bends but never breaks  
No mistakes just  
Pressure like a grip grip grip and it won't let go woah  
Pressure like a tick tick tick 'til it's ready to blow woah-oh-oh  
Give it to your sister and never wonder  
If the same pressure would've pulled you under  
Who am I if I don't have what it takes  
No cracks no breaks  
No mistakes  
No pressure
