### Good Life歌词：

Kehlani：  
Raise a cup up for all my day ones  
Two middle fingers for the haters  
Life's only getting greater  
Straight up from nothing we go up  
Higher than the highest skyscraper  
No little league we major  
The proof is in the paper  
We put the good in the good in the good life  
We put the good in the good in the good life  
We put the bad in the past now we alright  
Hey hey hey hey  
G-Eazy：  
And it's a feeling that I can't explain  
How you make it and your team still stay the same  
Stay down from the jump and they never change  
Man this a moment I could never trade yeah  
I told my moms not to stress no more  
Go hit the bentley store and no credit card debts no more  
I bought the crib and it's in escrow now  
So you never have to worry about how you gon' pay rent no more  
I put my team in position now they makin' a killin'  
Stackin' blue faces straight to the ceiling  
Out in vegas I'm with 'em  
Ordering bottles of that ace when they sit 'em  
'Til there ain't enough space up on the table to fit 'em  
Go ahead and  
Kehlani：  
Raise a cup up for all my day ones  
Two middle fingers for the haters  
Life's only getting greater  
Straight up from nothing we go up  
Higher than the highest skyscraper  
No little league we major  
The proof is in the paper  
We put the good in the good in the good life  
We put the good in the good in the good life  
We put the bad in the past now we alright  
Hey hey hey hey  
Hey  
G-Eazy：  
Pour some clicquot in the glass have a toast to success  
No looking back from here no more being broke and distressed  
I put my heart into this game like I opened my chest  
We only pray for more M's while you hope for the best  
We make these plays man I'm finessin' these checks  
Times up for everybody I'm collecting on debts  
And I swear this champagne just tastes better on jets  
I'm just out here being great man this is as real as it gets  
I put my team in position now they makin' a killin'  
Stackin' blue faces straight to the ceiling  
Out in vegas I'm with 'em  
Ordering bottles of that ace when they sit 'em  
'Til there ain't enough space up on the table to fit 'em  
Go ahead and  
Kehlani：  
Raise a cup up for all my day ones  
Two middle fingers for the haters  
Life's only getting greater  
Straight up from nothing we go up  
Higher than the highest skyscraper  
No little league we major  
The proof is in the paper  
We put the good in the good in the good life  
We put the good in the good in the good life  
We put the bad in the past now we alright  
Hey hey hey hey  
Hey  
Damn right from the bottom we rise  
So high now we cover sky lights  
We're building an empire  
We owe it all to each other  
Just look at us right now destined  
We're so good right now legend  
Here's to you and I  
Raise 'em to the sky  
We put the good in the good in the good life  
We put the good in the good in the good life  
We put the bad in the past now we alright  
Hey hey hey hey  
We put the good in the good in the good life  
We put the good in the good in the good life  
We put the bad in the past now we alright  
Hey hey hey hey  
G-Eazy：  
Uh the good life
