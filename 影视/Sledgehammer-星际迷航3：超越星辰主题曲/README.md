**Sledgehammer**
是巴巴多斯女歌手Rihanna（蕾哈娜）演唱的歌曲，由希雅（Sia）、蕾哈娜和杰西•沙特金填词谱曲，作为主题曲收录在电影《星际迷航3：超越星辰》的原声带中，于2016年6月26日通过Roc
Nation唱片公司发布。

这首歌气势磅礴，听觉方面，歌曲整体走向缓慢而神秘，营造出极致的空灵。宏大场面中蕴藏着几乎炸裂的能力。

_Sledgehammer_
中有最细致化展示。从开场的静谧到随后的爆发，全程松弛但不失紧张。声音处理处于野蛮生长态势，这是有别于程式化的女声，跟学院派的精致相悖，这属于原始呐喊，所有发声都是本能迸发。也正是因为如此，这款嗓音跟《星际迷航》完美配搭，那种未知的感觉完全得到体现。这种异域色彩的“怪”充分满足猎奇欲望，对于普通听者而言，领率歌曲就足够完成奇妙探险旅行。来自上古的原生态声响出现在现代语境中，这含带着时光穿梭意味。

### Sledgehammer歌词：

[Verse 1]  
I hit a wall, I never felt so low, so low  
Like a waterfall, my tears dropped to the floor, the floor  
They left a swimming pool of salted crimes, crimes  
Oh, what could I do to change your mind?  
Nothing  
[Pre-Chorus 1]  
I'm bracing for the pain and I am letting go  
I'm using all my strength to get out of this hole  
[Chorus]  
I hit a wall, I thought that I would hurt myself  
Oh I was sure, your words would leave me unconscious  
And on the floor I'd be lying cold, lifeless  
But I hit a wall, I hit 'em all, watch the fall  
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer  
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer  
[Verse 2]  
Yeah I hit a wall, I prayed that I would make it through, make it through  
I can't survive a life that's without you, that's without you, yeah  
And I will rise up from the ashes now, the ashes now  
Oh, the sparrow flies with just the crumbs of loving spilled, yeah  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
I was bracing for the pain and then I let it go  
I gathered all my strength and I found myself whole  
[Chorus]  
I hit a wall, I thought that I would hurt myself  
Oh I was sure, your words would leave me unconscious  
And on the floor I'd be lying cold, lifeless  
But I hit a wall, I hit 'em all, watch the fall  
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer  
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer  
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer  
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer
