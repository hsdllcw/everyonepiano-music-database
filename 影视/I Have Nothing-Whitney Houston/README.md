### I Have Nothing歌词：

Share my life  
Take me for what I am  
'Cause I'll never change  
All my colors for you

Take my love  
I'll never ask for too much  
Just all that you are  
And everything that you do

I don't really need to look  
Very much further  
I don't want to have to go  
Where you don't follow  
I will hold it back again  
This passion inside  
Can't run from myself  
There's nowhere to hide

Don't make me close one more door  
I don't want to hurt anymore  
Stay in my arms if you dare  
Or must I imagine you there  
Don't walk away from me  
I have nothing, nothing, nothing  
If I don't have you, you, you, you, you

You see through  
Right to the heart of me  
You break down my walls  
With the strength of your love

I never knew  
Love like I've known it with you  
Will a memory survive  
One I can hold on to?

I don't really need to look  
Very much further  
I don't want to have to go  
Where you don't follow  
I will hold it back again  
This passion inside  
I can't run from myself  
There's nowhere to hide  
Your love I'll remember forever

Don't make me close one more door  
I don't want to hurt anymore  
Stay in my arms if you dare  
Or must I imagine you there  
Don't walk away from me  
I have nothing, nothing, nothing

Don't make me close one more door  
I don't want to hurt anymore  
Stay in my arms if you dare  
Or must I imagine you there  
Don't walk away from me  
No, don't walk away from me  
Don't you dare walk away from me  
I have nothing, nothing, nothing  
If I don't have you, you  
If I don't have you, oh, oh
