### Monster歌词：

Elsa：  
It's finally come come to knock down my door  
I can't hide this time like I hid before  
The storm is awake the danger is real  
My time's running out don't feel don't feel  
Fear will be our enemy  
And death its consequence  
That's what they once said to me  
And it's starting to make sense  
All this pain all this fear began because of me  
Is the thing they see the thing I have to be  
A monster were they right  
Has the dark in me finally come to light  
Am I a monster full of rage  
Nowhere to go but on a rampage  
Or am I just a monster in a cage  
Hans/Male Ensemble：  
End this winter bring back summer  
Keep your guard up  
Hans：  
No harm comes to her  
Hans/Male Ensemble：  
End this winter bring back summer  
Keep your guard up  
Elsa：  
What do I do  
No time for crying now  
I've started this storm gotta stop it somehow  
Do I keep on running  
How far do I have to go  
And will that take the storm away  
Or only make it grow  
I'm making my world colder  
How long can it survive  
Is everyone in danger as long as I'm alive  
Was I a monster from the start  
How did I end up with this frozen heart  
Bringing destruction to the stage  
Caught in a war that I never meant to wage  
Do I kill the monster  
Father you know what's best for me  
If I die will they be free  
Mother what if after I'm gone  
The cold gets colder and the storm rages on  
No  
I have to stay alive to fix what I've done  
Save the world from myself  
And bring back the sun  
If I'm a monster then it's true  
There's only one thing that's left for me to do  
But before I fade to white  
I'll do all I can to make things right  
I cannot be a monster  
I will not be a monster  
Not tonight
