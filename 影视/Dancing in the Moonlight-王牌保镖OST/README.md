### Dancing in the Moonlight歌词：

We get it almost every night  
When that moon get so big and bright  
It's a supernatural delight  
Everybody's dancing in the moonlight  
Everybody here is out of sight  
They don't bark and they don't bite  
They keep things loose they keep things light  
Everybody's dancing in the moonlight  
Dancing in the moonlight  
Everybody's feeling warm and bright  
It's such a fine and natural sight  
Everybody's dancing in the moonlight  
We like our fun and we never fight  
You can't dance and stay uptight  
It's a supernatural delight  
Everybody was dancing in the moonlight  
Dancing in the moonlight  
Everybody's feeling warm and bright  
It's such a fine and natural sight  
Everybody's dancing in the moonlight  
Everybody here is out of sight  
They don't bark and they don't bite  
They keep things loose they keep things light  
Everybody was dancing in the moonlight  
Everybody's dancing in the moonlight  
Everybody's feeling warm and bright  
It's such a fine and natural sight  
Everybody's dancing in the moonlight everybody  
Dancing in the moonlight  
Everybody's feeling warm and bright  
It's such a fine and natural sight  
Everybody's dancing in the moonlight  
Everybody's dancing in the moonlight  
Everybody's feeling warm and bright  
It's such a fine and natural sight  
Everybody's dancing in the moonlight everybody  
Dancing in the moonlight  
Everybody's feeling warm and bright  
It's such a fine and natural sight  
Everybody's dancing in the moonlight
