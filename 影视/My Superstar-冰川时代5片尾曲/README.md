### My Superstar歌词：

Oh oh, oh Sid  
(Sid, baby, you make me so happy...)

Oh I, never knew I  
Would make it out and come this far  
Oh I, never knew I  
Would see the day we'd come together  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Oh it's not like anything I've ever felt before  
Yeah, baby

You, you make me happy  
You keep me laughing  
You make my world a better place  
You, you are my rainbow  
You colour my day so bright  
I want to stay forever with  
My superstar  
My superstar  
You shine so bright into my heart  
My superstar  
My superstar  
You shine so bright into my heart  
My love, my love, my love  
My love, my love, my love  
You're shining into my heart

Oh I, never knew I  
Would have it all, would have it all  
Oh I, never knew I  
Would feel so good, would feel the fall  
Oh I, never knew I  
Would live the dream, it's so surreal  
Oh I, never knew I  
Would see the day we'd come together

Oh it's like anything I've felt before, before, before

You, you make me happy  
You keep me laughing  
You make my world a better place  
You, you are my rainbow  
You colour my day so bright  
I want to stay forever with  
My superstar  
My superstar  
You shine so bright into my heart  
My superstar  
My superstar  
You shine so bright into my heart

My love, my love, my love  
My love, my love, my love  
You're shining into my heart

We're shining so bright, bright, bright, bright...  
You're shining so bright!

My love, my love, my love  
My love, my love, my love  
You're shining into my heart

(Yeah, yeah)

You, you make me happy  
You keep me laughing  
You make my world a better place  
You, you are my rainbow  
You colour my day so bright  
I want to stay forever with  
My superstar  
My superstar  
You shine so bright into my heart

(You're shining into my heart...)
