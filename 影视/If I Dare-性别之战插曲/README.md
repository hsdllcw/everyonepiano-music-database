### If I Dare歌词：

If I dare to ask you  
I dare it to be true  
If I dare to risk it  
I know that I'm willing to  
If I dare to want this  
To want more than I have  
Than I dare to believe  
I'll have it in the end  
You climbed the mountain  
Send pictures of the view  
And still can't believe when I started climbing too  
You haven't heard that  
I'm not afraid to fall  
That I'm not deterred yet  
Until I tell them all  
I am holding out for more than what I have now  
I'm holding out  
Don't want your pity  
Won't use your little scraps  
I don't build my cities  
With what could get taken back  
I don't need permission  
To rise up when it hurts  
You don't have to listen but you'll hear me mark my words  
I am holding out  
For more than what I have now  
I'm holding out  
When the room gets dark and I am quiet  
There's a voice that's soft like someones silhouette  
Saying don't let me go yet  
I am holding out  
I am holding out  
For more than what I have now  
I'll hold it out  
If I dare to ask it  
I dare it to be true  
If I dare to risk it  
I know that I'm willing to  
If I dare to want this  
To want more than I have  
Than I dare to believe  
I'll have it in the end
