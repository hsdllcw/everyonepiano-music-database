1993年，提姆•波顿拍了出了一部后来家喻户晓的鬼魅风格动画电影《Nightmare Before Christmas》（圣诞夜惊魂），这首片头插曲桥段《
**This Is Halloween** 》（这就是万圣节）也让人称为超级经典。

《圣诞夜惊魂》是一部奇幻动画电影（黏土动画、人偶动画、定格模型动画），导演亨利•谢利克（Henry Selick）、制片丹尼斯•狄诺维（Denise
DiNovi）和配乐、歌曲创作丹尼•叶夫曼（Danny
Elfman）都是提姆•波顿长期合作的伙伴，主题仍是提姆•波顿擅长的怪诞离奇故事和画面，获得奥斯卡金像奖最佳视觉效果提名。2006年，华特迪士尼影业将原本由试金石影业制作的《怪诞城之夜》制作成3D版立体映像电影，在影院上映时，观众需戴3D眼镜观看，影片内的画面都变得更生动逼真。

### This Is Halloween歌词：

Boys and girls of every age  
Wouldn't you like to see something strange  
Come with us and you will see  
This our town of Halloween  
This is Halloween this is Halloween  
Pumpkins scream in the dead of night  
This is Halloween everybody make a scene  
Trick or treat till the neighbors gonna die of fright  
It's our town everybody scream  
In this town of Halloween  
I am the one hiding under your bed  
Teeth ground sharp and eyes glowing red  
I am the one hiding under yours stairs  
Fingers like snakes and spiders in my hair  
This is Halloween this is Halloween  
Halloween Halloween Halloween Halloween  
In this town we call home  
Everyone hail to the pumpkin song  
In this town don't we love it now  
Everybody's waiting for the next surprise  
Round that corner man hiding in the trash can  
Something's waiting now to pounce  
And how you'll scream  
This is Halloween red 'n' black slimy green  
Aren't you scared Well that's just fine  
Say it once say it twice  
Take a chance and roll the dice  
Ride with the moon in the dead of night  
Everybody scream everybody scream  
In our town of Halloween  
I am the clown with the tear away face  
Here in a flash and gone without a trace  
I am the who when you call who's there  
I am the wind blowing through your hair  
I am the shadow on the moon at night  
Filling your dreams to the brim with fright  
This is Halloween this is Halloween  
Halloween Halloween Halloween Halloween  
Halloween Halloween  
Tender lumplings everywhere  
Life's no fun without a good scare  
That's our job but we're not mean  
In our town of Halloween  
In this town don't we love it now  
Everybody's waiting for the next surprise  
Skeleton Jack might catch you in the back  
And scream like a banshee  
Make you jump out of your skin  
This is Halloween everybody scream  
Won't you please make way for a very special guy  
Our man jack is king of the Pumpkin patch  
Everyone hail to the Pumpkin King now  
This is Halloween this is Halloween  
Halloween Halloween Halloween Halloween  
In this town we call home  
Everyone hail to the pumpkin song  
La la la la la  
La la la la la  
La la la la la  
La la la la whoo
