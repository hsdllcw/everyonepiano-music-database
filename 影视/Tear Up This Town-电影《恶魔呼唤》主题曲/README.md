### Tear Up This Town歌词：

[Verse 1]  
I wanna hand you my heart and let you carry the load  
Nobody tells you anything you need to know  
I need a friend but a friend is so hard to find  
I need an answer but I'm always one step behind

[Refrain]  
Cause it takes time  
Learning to fly  
[Verse 2]  
Do you ever feel like all you want is to go home  
To kiss the earth, to weave a way through this storm  
Some days I rage like a fire in the wilderness  
Some days I only need the darkness and a place to rest

[Refrain]  
Oh it takes time  
(It takes time)  
Learning to fly

[Chorus]  
Tear up this town  
Blinking in the sunlight as the walls come down  
This fire will burn  
Digging for a truth that just can't be found  
Don't want your lessons in love  
I want to tear it all up

[Bridge]  
I need a friend but a friend is so hard to find  
I need an answer but I'm always one step behind  
Oh it takes time  
(It takes time)  
Yes, it takes time  
(It takes time)  
Learning to fly

[Chorus]  
Tear up this town  
Blinking in the sunlight as the walls come down  
This fire will burn  
Digging for a truth that just can't be found  
Don't want your lessons in love  
I want to tear it all up
