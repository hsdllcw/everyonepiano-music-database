### The Other Side歌词：

SZA：  
You're preachin' to the choir stop hatin' on yourself  
Quit playin' with your mind you're spinnin  
If you think that I'm a liar just try it for yourself  
The clouds will open up blue skies are willing  
Yeah I know it's so hard to throw away  
The clouds will open up blue skies are willing  
SZA/Justin Timberlake：  
Back on your feet again lift your head hold it high  
You wanna run it back but you can't turn the time  
You start to feel like you're losing your shine  
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side  
Other side got you stuck in your mind  
You start to feel like you're losing your shine  
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side  
Justin Timberlake/SZA：  
Hey you stop stressin' 'bout what you're missin'  
So blue just take it easy take your time  
If you think my words are wise just try it for yourself  
I promise the stars will light the path you walk  
Don't give in  
Got a heart of gold what a shame to go to waste  
The clouds will open up blue skies are willing  
SZA/Justin Timberlake：  
Back on your feet again lift your head hold it high  
You wanna run it back but you can't turn the time  
You start to feel like you're losing your shine  
Losing your shine shine  
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side  
Other side  
Feet again lift your head hold it high  
Got you stuck in your mind  
Run it back but you can't turn the time  
You start to feel like you're losing your shine  
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side  
SZA/Justin Timberlake：  
Just take it from me you'll be okay  
You'll be okay  
'Cause it don't matter how sweet it taste  
How sweet it taste  
The grass ain't green don't worry  
Losin' sleep still wanna get  
Yeah you get  
SZA/Justin Timberlake：  
Back on your feet again lift your head hold it high  
You wanna run it back but you can't turn the time  
You start to feel like you're losing your shine  
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side  
You start to feel like you're losing your shine  
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side
