### Wake Up歌词：

Here's the one thing I want you to know  
You got someplace to go  
Life's a test yes  
But you go toe to toe  
You don't give up no you grow  
And you use your pain  
'Cause it makes you you  
Though I wish I could hold you through it  
I know it's not the same  
You got living to do  
And I just want you to do it  
So get up get out relight that spark  
You know the rest by heart  
Wake up wake up if it's all you do  
Look out look inside of you  
It's not what you lost it's what you'll gain  
Raising your voice to the rain  
Wake up your dream and make it true  
Look out look inside of you  
It's not what you lost  
Relight that spark  
Time to come out of the dark  
Wake up wake up  
Better wake those demons just look them in the eye  
No reason not to try  
Life can be a mess I won't let it cloud my mind  
I'll let my fingers fly  
And I use the pain 'cause it's part of me  
And I'm ready to power through it  
Gonna find the strength find the melody  
'Cause you showed me how to do it  
Get up get out relight that spark  
You know the rest by heart  
Wake up wake up if it's all you do  
Look out look inside of you  
It's not what you lost it's what you'll gain  
Raising your voice to the rain  
Wake up your dream and make it true  
Look out look inside of you  
It's not what you lost  
Relight that spark  
Time to come out of the dark  
Wake up wake up  
So wake that spirit spirit  
I wanna hear it hear it  
No need to fear it you're not alone  
You're gonna find your way home  
Wake up wake up if it's all you do  
Look out look inside of you  
It's not what you lost it's what you'll gain  
Raising your voice to the rain  
Wake up your dream and make it true  
Look out look inside of you  
When you're feeling lost  
Relight that spark  
Time to come out of the dark  
Wake up wake up
