### Never Enough歌词：

I'm trying to hold my breath  
Let it stay this way  
Can't let this moment end  
You set off a dream with me  
Getting louder now  
Can you hear it echoing  
Take my hand  
Will you share this with me  
'Cause darling without you  
All the shine of a thousand spotlights  
All the stars we steal from the nightsky  
Will never be enough  
Never be enough  
Towers of gold are still too little  
These hands could hold the world but it'll  
Never be enough  
Never be enough  
For me  
Never never  
Never never  
Never for me  
For me  
Never enough  
Never enough  
Never enough  
For me  
For me  
For me  
All the shine of a thousand spotlights  
All the stars we steal from the nightsky  
Will never be enough  
Never be enough  
Towers of gold are still too little  
These hands could hold the world but it'll  
Never be enough  
Never be enough  
For me  
Never never  
Never never  
Never for me  
For me  
Never enough  
Never never  
Never enough  
Never never  
Never enough  
For me  
For me  
For me  
For me
