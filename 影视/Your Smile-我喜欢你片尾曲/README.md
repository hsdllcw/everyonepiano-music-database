### Your Smile歌词：

I can't tell if this is real love  
But I know how I feel  
To be very honest with you love  
I wanna get close to you  
I don't know how you gon' take it  
But I keep on thinking 'bout you  
You've been on my mind ever  
Since I saw you smiling at me  
Your smile  
Baby I'm just falling to you  
You don't need to say anything special  
Cause I'm pretty sure  
You're the morning dew that has fallen soft during the night on me  
So naturally  
Like we're meant to be together  
That's how I see it  
Though it seems illusive  
Can you tell how much my love is pure  
You can't buy it or sell  
To be very honest with you love  
I wanna get close to you  
I don't know how you gon' take it  
But I keep on thinking 'bout you  
You've been on my mind ever  
Since I saw you smiling at me  
Your smile  
Baby I'm just falling to you  
You don't need to say anything special  
Cause I'm pretty sure  
You're the morning dew that has fallen soft during the night on me  
So naturally  
Like we're meant to be together  
That's how I see that's how it's supposed to be  
People come and go  
But I won't stop loving you
