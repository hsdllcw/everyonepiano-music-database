### Back to You歌词：

Took you like a shot  
Thought that I could chase you with a cold evening  
Let a couple years water down how I'm feeling about you  
Feeling about you  
And every time we talk  
Every single word builds up to this moment  
And I gotta convince myself I don't want it  
Even though I do even though I do  
You could break my heart in two  
But when it heals it beats for you  
I know it's forward but it's true  
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to  
When I'm lying close to someone else  
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it  
If I could do it all again  
I know I'd go back to you  
I know I'd go back to you  
I know I'd go back to you  
We never got it right  
Playing and replaying old conversations  
Over thinking every word and I hate it  
'Cause it's not me 'cause it's not me  
And what's the point in hiding  
Everybody knows we got unfinished business  
And I'll regret it if I didn't say  
This isn't what it could be isn't what it could be  
You could break my heart in two  
But when it heals it beats for you  
I know it's forward but it's true  
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to  
When I'm lying close to someone else  
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it  
If I could do it all again  
I know I'd go back to you  
Go back to you  
Go back to you  
I know I'd go back to you  
I'd go back to you  
I'd go back to you  
What was there wasn't sure  
But I'd go back to you  
I know I'd go back to you  
You can break my heart in two  
But when it heals it beats for you  
I know it's forward but it's true  
Won't lie I'd go back to you  
You know my thoughts are running loose  
It's just a thing you make me do  
And I could fight but what's the use  
I know I'd go back to you  
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to  
When I'm lying close to someone else  
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it  
If I could do it all again  
I know I'd go back to you  
I'd go back to you  
I'd go back to you  
I know I'd go back to you  
I'd go back to you  
I'd go back to you  
I know I'd go back to you  
Go back to you go back to you  
Go back to you go back to you  
Go back to you
