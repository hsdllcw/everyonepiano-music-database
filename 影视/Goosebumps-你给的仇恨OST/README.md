### Goosebumps歌词：

Yeah  
7:30 in the night  
Ooooh ooh  
I get those goosebumps every time yeah  
You come around yeah  
You ease my mind you make everything feel fine  
Worry about those comments  
I'm way too numb yeah it's way too dumb yeah  
I get those goosebumps every time I need the Heimlich  
Throw that to the side yeah  
I get those goosebumps every time yeah  
When you're not around  
When you throw that to the side yeah  
I get those goosebumps every time yeah  
713 to the 281 yeah I'm riding  
Why they on me why they on me I'm flyin'  
Sippin' lowkey I'm sipping lowkey in Onyx  
Rider rider when I'm pullin' up right beside ya  
Popstar lil' Mariah  
When I text a cute game wildness  
Throw a stack on the Bible  
Never Snapchat or took molly  
She fall through plenty her and all her ginnies  
Yeah we at the top floor right there off Doheny  
Yeah  
Oh no I can't f**k with y'all  
Yeah when I'm with my squad I cannot do no wrong  
Yeah saucing in the city don't get misinformed yeah  
They gona pull up on you brr brr brr  
Yeah we gona do some things some things you can't relate  
Yeah cause we from a place a place you cannot stay  
Oh you can't go oh I don't know  
Oh back the f**k up off me brr brr brr  
I get those goosebumps every time yeah  
You come around yeah  
You ease my mind you make everything feel fine  
Worry about those comments  
I'm way too numb yeah it's way too dumb  
Yeah

Throw that to the side yeah

Kendrick Lamar：  
I want to press my like yeah I wanna press my  
I want a green light I wanna be like  
I wanna press my line yeah  
I want to take that ride yeah  
I'm gonna press my lime  
I wanna green light I wanna be like I wanna press my  
Mama dear spare your feelings  
I'm reliving moments peeling more residual  
I can buy the building burn the building  
Take your b**ch rebuild the building just to f**k some more  
I can justify my love for you  
And touch the sky for God to stop debating war  
Put the p**sy on a pedestal  
Put the p**sy on a high horse  
That p**sy to die for  
That p**sy to die for  
Peter piper picked a pepper  
So I could pick your brain and put your heart together  
We depart the shady parts and party hard  
The diamonds yours  
The coupe forever  
My best shots might shoot forever like brr  
I get those goosebumps every time yeah  
You come around yeah  
You ease my mind you make everything feel fine  
Worry about those comments  
I'm way too numb yeah it's way too dumb yeah  
I get those goosebumps every time I need the Heimlich  
Throw that to the side yeah  
I get those goosebumps every time yeah  
When you're not around  
When you throw that to the side yeah  
I get those goosebumps every time
